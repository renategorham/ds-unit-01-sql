We let scheduled guests know of the situation in advance, and gave them an option to cancel, or receive a discounted stay.  For those that opted to cancel, we felt it was only fair to cancel on their behalf, incurring fees and penalties on our end as a result.  This is because at the time, Airbnb didn't refund their ""service fees"" when a guest cancelled their own reservation, they only received a FULL refund if the host made the cancellation.  Prior to our home renovation, we've never cancelled on our guests, and don't plan to in the future!

Here’s a little bit about us…

This is Kevin.  I was born in San Francisco, lived in Ireland when I was young, but San Jose has been home for most of my life.  I’m an avid reader, enjoy writing, and I love history.

This is Vicky.  I was born in Vietnam and I immigrated to the US with my family when I was 2 years old.  I work in high-tech, love baking and traveling, and can be found at the gym regularly.

Together, we love exploring new things.  Whether it’s new foods, places to visit or experiences, we love the adventure of life.  Most of all, we love time with each other, our kids, family and friends.  

We chose Pacific Grove because it is a charming town with wonderful restaurants, a beautiful coastline and the historic Cannery Row.  And there’s plenty to do – sailing, whale watching, hiking, kayaking, cycling, and wonderful coastline pathways to stroll between the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Lover’s Point.  Pacific Grove also has the historic literary appeal of being the home of John Steinbeck, American author and Pulitzer Prize winner.

Besides being charming and beautiful, the cottages are distinctly unique having once been the home of author John Steinbeck. There is a rich and wonderful history to these 100-year-old cottages.  When Steinbeck resided here he formulated the plot of The Grapes of Wrath, and wrote several books including The Sea of Cortez.  This is the home he shared with his second wife, Gwyn Conger, who would become the inspiration for the lead antagonist, Kate Trask, in his epic novel, East of Eden.  In a letter to a friend, Steinbeck wrote of the cottages, “It is a pleasant little house, and we miss it… You’ll find you get a lot of thinking done in that house.” ' (from John Steinbeck, A Life in Letters).  

We are excited to share this wonderful piece of history with you and know you will enjoy your stay.

We are life long travelers & sailors and have logged many miles throughout the years sailing along the coasts of California, Mexico, Central America & throughout the South Pacific to New Zealand & back to California. We love the adventure of meeting new people from around the world & learning about their way of life, their unique perspectives & cultural histories. We have always considered ourselves lucky to return to our home port of Monterey & Pacific Grove as we consider it to be one of the most scenically spectacular places in the world. Pacific Grove is a very special coastal community to us because it offers a small town feel along with this stunning geographic beauty and offers many interesting outdoor activities that we enjoy. A favorite activity just steps from our cottage is our 18 mile bike & walking path where we go to enjoy an evening walk & watch the sunset & sometimes we rent a surrey to take our granddaughter along the spectacular coastline to the Monterey Bay Aquarium & stop to enjoy a picnic along the way at the park along Ocean View Blvd which makes for lasting memories. We enjoy good food & often dine at the fine restaurants in downtown Pacific Grove, nearby Cannery Row, Carmel By-the-Sea, and south to Big Sur. We also enjoy hiking in Point Lobos, Big Sur, & Carmel Valley's Garland Park & of course sailing on beautiful Monterey Bay where whales can be spotted year round to name a few of our favorites places to relax in nature. Just around the corner from Lover's Point Beach & Park, our cottage offers all that makes Pacific Grove a destination to enjoy. Our beach house offers a casual & relaxing get-a-way to share with family and friends & we look forward to offering this special place to fellow intrepid travelers from around the world.

Here, time slows, the architecture is humble (with the exception of the homes in Pebble Beach), and the lifestyle is the perfect synthesis of SoCal laid back and NorCal sophisticated. On the northern side of the peninsula, the town of Monterey draws most of the tourists, while farther south, Carmel-by-the-Sea lures the easygoing wealthy set. Tremendous price tags on real estate helps maintain the small-community atmosphere along Monterey's jaw-dropping coastline.      This area makes for a tremendous road-trip stop or romantic weekend stay. And did we mention the golf courses? This stretch of the California coastline boasts some of the most coveted fairways in the world.

Thank you for visiting our listing. This unique Cape Cod, country style house was built in 1910 for Roberta and Anne Littlehale. In 1928, it was given to Father Kerfs for a token $10 payment and used as a rectory for the first St. Angela’s Catholic Church, which was next door at that time. Later, it was used as the convent for the Dominican Sisters teaching at St. Angela’s School. In 1960 it was restored to its original appearance.

In 1983, it was expanded into a bed & breakfast inn of exceptional charm and comfort. The unusual combination of New England architecture and Pacific locale promises an unforgettable experience. Some rooms have an ocean view, and each has been designed to enhance the original beauty of the inn. Warm, natural colors, beautiful country pine antiques plants and cut flowers lend to the homey, comfortable atmosphere.

During your stay you will enjoy a from-scratch breakfast, afternoon tea with wine, coffee, tea and home-baked cookies.
