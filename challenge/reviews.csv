The house is gorgeous, with lots of spaces to get cozy and lounge in, including a sweet garden. The location is fabulous -- beautiful neighborhood w/great walks along the cliffs and a short drive to restaurants, etc. Wonderful place!"
22772,1121953,2012-04-13,2076189,Anastasia,"I only like good surprises and Amie's cottage was a pleasantly, exquisite surprise with charm with effortless style and comfort.  The photos do not accurately reflect the magical experience that happens when you step into the cottage.
Most importantly, Amie was very attentive from inception of the reservation without being intrusive.

I suggest that future guests be as considerate of Amie as she is to you.
Cheers!
Anastasia"
22772,1210438,2012-05-01,1191971,Robert,"Perfect experience!  The rental process was easy.  Amie was responsive and accurate with descriptions.  She even stocked the fridge with some items we were going to buy on our own, making life really easy for us.  The house is ... perfect.  The exterior is really cute, and the interior is, too.  It is exactly as pictured.  My girlfriend and I couldn't have been any happier there.  It was really easy to feel at home there.  That said, the location is so great - we also wanted to get out!  Pacific Grove is really cool - and there a few great restaurants that are fancy, and a few that are super but not fancy at all.  I've stayed in Monterey for work...but Pacific Grove is better.  And the location of Amie's house is ideal - a few blocks to restaurants, and only a block to the beach.  Lastly, we didn't have to contact Amie for anything during the stay...which is exactly how I like it because it means we had all we needed.  I would definitely stay at Amie's again!"
22772,1375254,2012-05-29,558418,Daniel,"Had a memorable stay at this cottage in Pacific Grove. Amie was a pleasure to deal with - prompt communications and very accommodating. The house is very well appointed and furnished, with a nice garden patio in the back. Amie was nice enough to stock some staple foods and snacks for our stay. The cottage is only a couple blocks away from the ocean, so it's perfectly situated."
22772,1882747,2012-08-04,2567986,Robert,"We had a wonderful stay at Storybook Cottage. The cottage looks just like the photo's, no trick photography, a great place for a couple. Amie was most cordial and responsive to all communications.We needed to change our reservation dates and Amie made the process simple and painless. The cottage was within walking distance anything we wanted to do or see. A great location. We will definitely return !"
22772,1975942,2012-08-13,3159927,Ali,"Adorable little cottage in an excellent location.  Easy walk to beach and restaurants. The area is great for biking, walking, or just hanging out at the beach.  Owner was very responsive and welcoming, including leaving us fresh flowers and food for our stay. The cottage was too cute for its own good. Street parking was easy. 20 minute stroll to the Aquarium and Cannery Row."
22772,2027232,2012-08-19,2393320,Angel,"Very sweet cottage. Walking distance to shops, food and water."
22772,2051594,2012-08-21,2071962,Jaclyn,"The cottage was adorable and perfectly located. The back garden was an amazing setting for a glass of wine and snacks. The kitchen was stocked with treats and Amy was even kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine to enjoy.
Both my boyfriend and I said that we'd absolutely return the next time we are in the area. 
Loved loved loved it! :-)"

22772,2322831,2012-09-17,2270661,Alicia,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and the place was great. It was easy to find and was the perfect amount of space for the two of us. Amie was a gracious host and left us a welcome note and basket with goodies!!! Would definitely recommend this place to others.
22772,3977969,2013-04-01,5137529,Clint,"Amazing charm!  Steps away from wonderful restaurants and the beach/tide pools, but the coziness of the cottage ultimately wins out on the tug for your presence."
22772,4076050,2013-04-08,5134315,Melissa,Very cute house walking distance to Lovers Point and downtown PG.  Perfect for a couple.
22772,4364557,2013-04-30,1471446,Wilhemina,"Staying at Amie's house by the sea was a lovely experience. The house is in a perfect location. Steps to Lover's Point and steps to all the restaurants, cafes, and shops on Lighthouse ave, yet, far enough from both to avoid the bustle. The house is cozy and elegantly decorated, everything you could need is provided. The bed and sofa are both ridiculously comfortable. Amie also thoughtfully provided a bottle of wine, fresh cut flowers, gourmet treats, and fruit, along with a handwritten note. The house is also within reasonable walking distance to the aquarium and shops at Cannery Row via a manicured path facing Monterey Bay that you can walk on or rent bikes. Amie was a lovely host, easy to communicate with, flexible and timely. I enjoyed the privacy and ideal location of the Getaway and hope to return soon. "
22772,4588950,2013-05-13,4898554,Melody,Amie's house is soooooo adorable and awesome! This house has everything you need and feels like home! Amie is also very quick to follow up. Amazing place! 
22772,4835493,2013-05-28,2639070,Tianna,"Everything was amazing! Amie was fantastic and so welcoming, even left us a hand-written note which made the check in even more spacial. 

The cottage was perfect for us. Great location, perfect for having our dog with us and just having a relaxing weekend. We enjoyed the outdoor space and BBQ. Overall, one of the best AirBnb experiences I've had. 

We will definitely rent this place again in the future :)"
22772,5169009,2013-06-16,6010688,Brendan,"best neighborhood, close to everything. House is a cute bungalow, very clean and cosy. Delicious breakfast left, a good stay. "
22772,5461232,2013-07-01,1725550,Anna,"Amie was a fantastic host! We had a wonderful time exploring the beaches and local restaurants, and all of Amie's personal touches - the wine, the chocolate, the toys for our two dogs - made the entire trip so special. We definitely recommend Amie's getaway if you're planning a trip in the area."
22772,5606630,2013-07-08,6616052,Briony,"Amie's cottage at Pacific Grove was very comfortable, it really felt like having our own home in a prime location!  
Amie was very easy to contact, and went out of her way to leave some lovely touches around for our arrival... flowers, breakfast and even a bottle of wine!  The cottage is very well furnished, and we appreciated having the deck area at the back to relax after touring around.
The location was perfect, a couple of blocks from Pacific Grove stores, (highly recommended) restaurants and beach... and walking / riding distance to Monterey and Carmel.  We really enjoyed being able to access all the attractions of the area while being able to come back to our peaceful 'retreat'.
Thank you Amie for a great long weekend!"
22772,5904375,2013-07-22,2569258,Sarah,"Amie's place is decorated in a glam vintage type of feel. It's lovely and I felt very at home there. I used the cottage for my wedding weekend and everything was swell. Amie was even able to arrange to have the place cleaned up while we were gone, so everything was spick and span when my husband and I returned after the wedding. I have to say the place was set up for great pictures, the photographer was able to capture some beautiful pictures there :) Amie even left some champagne, chocolate and a lovely note to tell me congrats!

The only thing that wasn't perfect was that there was still powdered bleach in the shower when I arrived, so my sister and I had to clean the shower ourselves. No big deal, though. Overall, it was a great experience and I would stay there again."
22772,6272860,2013-08-06,6342069,Roy,"We have used many apartments and have high expectations. Positive comments are : excellent location to explore Monterey Bay area; free street car parking; friendly and helpful neighbours; quaint cottage for couples; clean; well maintained; comfortable with all facilities and quality equipment; quiet with sunny rear courtyard; close to good supermarkets, restaurants, shops and beach. Negative comments are TV only operates DVD and does not receive TV channels; no computer BUT computer available free in library from Tuesday  to Saturday; ironing board stored outside which needs cleaning before use; no plug in wash basin"
22772,6457142,2013-08-13,29779,Helen,"Amie's gorgeous little yellow house is just perfect for two people with all the amenities in this compact house and courtyard. Great location being a short stroll to the market and restaurants. I even had a hair trim in Cambria too. The Aquarium is about a 20-25 walk from Amie's place so no hassle looking for parking. We also loved the squirrels who seem to regularly be around the back courtyard.

Amie goes to extra effort with her property by supplying fresh flowers, some goodies in the frig, beautiful linen and candles. Her kitchen was well stocked with crockery and utensils. 

We felt quite privileged to have stayed there, and would highly recommend it for two people. Thanks very much Amy,"
22772,6612099,2013-08-19,2389586,Emily,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying in Pacific Grove at Amie's perfect little yellow cottage. This is a wonderful place for a couple to spend a few days enjoying the Carmel peninsula. In addition to the clean, wonderfully-appointed environment, Amie left wine and chocolate and a few breakfast goodies for us. There is no parking, but it was very easy to park on the street even during Concours d'Elegance, which was the same weekend we were there and one of the busiest times for the area. We were easily able to access Point Lobos, Big Sur, Carmel, Pebble Beach, and Monterey either on foot, bike or by car. I would love to have the opportunity to stay here again--it could not have been better. Thanks Amie!"
22772,7929714,2013-10-08,16061597,Brian,"Amie's place is lovely!  My wife and I just spent a glorious weekend in her wonderful cottage, which is a very short walk to the beach, parks, and a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Monterey.  It's also right at the start of 17 mile drive, which is perfect.  Amie is a great host as well - her place is clean and well appointed, she has a great personal touch with flowers, a bottle of wine, some snacks, a welcome note, and guidebooks for the surrounding area.  Highly recommended!"
22772,8059454,2013-10-14,1247681,Ethan,Amie's place is beautiful. There was a bottle of wine and chocolate waiting for us!
22772,8789581,2013-11-18,3770083,John,"Amie's place in Pacific Grove is awesome! Cozy, comfortable, centrally located, within walking distance to everything we wanted to do. A great stay in a great place! In fact, the Big Sur half marathon was on Sunday and the runners came right down 17th street in front of the house. It was really cool! Thanks Amie!"
22772,9004700,2013-12-01,4001429,William,"Great location!!! Just a few blocks from the beach, coastal trail/Monterey trail, and main street Pacific Grove restaurants and services.

As for the place, this is a quaint cottage. Bed was great! Incredibly comfortable. Small dogs are allowed and this is worth the price right there.

Amie had lots of edibles waiting (and they were appreciated upon arrival): bottle of wine, cheese, chocolate, pumpkin cake, crackers. 

Not sure if this is place is meant for heavy duty cooking: kitchen is small (no dishwasher), small freezer in fridge, no garbage disposal.

Outdoor patio is cute. The houses in the neighborhood are very close together. Heat is interesting as every room seemed to have a different temperature so keep in mind during colder month stays.

Overall, nice for a couple who is going to eat out, tour the coast, and have their little dog with them.

Thanks, Amie!"
22772,10395487,2014-02-17,8730675,Ravi,"My wife and I stayed at Amie's house for two nights. Amie was a great host and her home is at perfect location in Pacific Grove. We did not have to drive at all during our trip. There were plenty of great restaurants, antique stores and coffee shops. Beach and Cannery Row is only few mins walk as well. Overall we really enjoyed our valentines weekend at Amie's wonderful house. Great experience!  "

22772,14307077,2014-06-16,11676432,Catherine & Chris,"Wow - - this is a magical cottage down an lovely ocean view street a few blocks from Lovers' Point. Photos do not do it justice! Amie was a great host who was thoughtful enough to leave us pretty fresh flowers, fruit, vino and all the amenities we needed to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday! It was just divine - - romantic, comfortable, homey, a great vibe. We especially loved the back sunroom/reading nook. 

I hope we have a chance to stay here again - - I would not want to stay anywhere else if I come back to the area!

Thanks so much Amie!  "

22772,16994104,2014-08-05,15964901,Jeffrey,"The house was an adorable getaway very close to the water, and easy access to some of the little shops in Pacific Grove, also within a quick 5-min drive of Monterrey where it was fun to walk around. Amie was very gracious and left flowers and a bottle of wine with yummy chocolates for us. I wish the weather had been a little warmer but no one can control that; overall a fantastic and enjoyable experience in a cozy home by the beach."
22772,18894918,2014-09-02,19064512,Meredith,"Amie's place was great! It's Ina very convenient location; walking distance to beach, restaurants, town square and even cannery row! The cottage is idyllic for two people looking for a low key weekend away. My boyfriend and I loved the nearby, seaside running path. We had an awesome weekend that included kayaking, picnics at lovers point, massages and lots of seafood! Amie was a gracious host and gifted us a bottle of wine and some snacks. I had emailed her beforehand and she gave me some recommendations and suggestions about restaurants and things to do in the area. You certainly won't regret staying at Amie's adorable cottage!  "
22772,19252723,2014-09-08,2393263,Ashwin,We enjoyed staying at Amie's place – very nice neighborhood and ideal location steps from the water and great views.

22772,19618377,2014-09-15,11773450,Robyn,"The Getaway at Lover's point was wonderful. Amie had a bottle of wine, coffee and snacks waiting my arrival. The cottage was beautifully decorated with all the amenities for a comfortable beach getaway. The location was great for thoroughly enjoying everything Pacific Grove has to offer. Close to the ocean, shopping & great restaurants. Amie even had guidebooks to the area placed with the wine.  The backyard was a welcome space to sit & enjoy the cool weather & ambiance of the cottage. If you have always wanted to stay in a period Pacific Grove cottage this is the location for you. It is in a safe, friendly neighborhood. Amie's secret cottage makes you feel very special."
22772,21356730,2014-10-15,9038200,Jeremy,"Spent 3 nights here. Great place, really cute, great location. Really relaxing here. Highly recommend it. 

The place is a little love shack. And the owner treats it that way, leaving us a bottle of wine and chocolate, really thoughtful, as we stayed here for a few days before our wedding in Sonoma. "
22772,23174969,2014-11-24,4275652,Susan,"This charming near-the-ocean historic small home is now #1 on my list of places to stay in the Monterey area.   It is perfect for a couple wanting a romantic getaway within easy walking distance of everything in Pacific Grove.   

Amie made us feel welcome with a bottle of wine, a bar of organic chocolate and even a cranberry-fig tart -- as well as visitor information.

Soft wonderful bed, comfortable living room furniture, great coffee maker (and coffee beans), and so much more.

The sitting area in her small backyard is also lovely.  I can't wait to return -- again and again and again. "

22772,39500914,2015-07-24,34401999,Dennis,"A really good location.  Very well maintained for a home build 100 years ago.  Charming and cozy.  Amie made it all very easy really.  We are used to a king size bed, so that was a bit of an adjustment.  We knew going in that there was no cable TV (surprisingly I managed, which amazed my wife!), and the internet connection was great.  An easy walk to the heart of Pacific Grove and even Cannery Row.  Overall a fun experience.  "

The house was very cute and cozy with all that we needed...Made it hard to leave daily to go see all the sights Monterey & Pacific Grove have to offer.  Property was as described and we felt right at home.  The neighborhood was Pacific Grove to the T and we dug in to the local restaurants and shops.  Amie, our host, was very attentive to questions/emails before our stay.  We were pleasantly surprised to arrive to a local bottle of wine, cheese & crackers and chocolates!  That got day 1 off to a great start!  Thank you Amie for helping to make #10 a very memorable one!"

His house is perfectly situated being close to everything, especially the beutiful shoreline. Do walk it, repeatedly. Amie, the host, communicated perfectly. The house she provided us was spotless and perfect for a couple. Comfortable furnture, and full kitchen to boot. Amie provided some welcoming snacks and wine - thankfully received after our long trip from MD."

My fiancee and I loved this place!  Amie had a welcome basket prepared for us when we arrived and the cottage itself was adorable.

Not only was it ideally located to the start of the tri (just two blocks) but it was also a mere two blocks from downtown Pacific Grove. We enjoyed the quiet mornings as well as the warm Saturday afternoon when we relaxed in the serene backyard while watching marine birds surfing the sky above. The house is clean, comfortable, and inviting. We recommend staying here!"

The cottage was exactly as pictured - very charming and ornately decorated. The sun room in the back was peaceful and pleasant for having morning coffee. The kitchen is minimal, so I wouldn't recommend major cooking projects. Amie was kind enough to welcome our small dog, which we appreciated very much. She also surprised us with a delicious assortment of snacks, fresh fruit, candy, and a bottle of wine."
22772,88324458,2016-07-24,76620732,Laura,"The cottage was exactly as described both as to furnishings and location. The cottage is very quaint and harkens back to another era.    The neighborhood is great with foot traffic during the day and is very quiet at night.  There is virtually no noise in the neighborhood after about 9:30 pm.  Great location!   The kitchen is small and the stove is an antique so we were not comfortable cooking but it was easy to pick-up or eat out.  Amie was kind enough to welcome our small dog, which we appreciated very much. We arrived to a bottle of wine and cheese along with fruit and snacks, which was very thoughtful.  

Overall, the property was very comfortable and we had a great week in Pacific Grove."

We rented Kirsties home for a couple days for our wedding. It was a perfect place for the adults and also for the kids. The game room was a huge hit! Everyone enjoyed the spectacular views as well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because we found our check out to be a bit early. We left the day after our wedding and didn't get to have a relaxing morning. I would suggest to arrange a later check out ahead of time . However, we enjoyed our stay to the fullest and highly recommend this house for your next getaway. Thanks Kirstie!!"
41014,602779,2011-10-06,744406,Jamal,We couldn't have asked for a better vacation. The owner walked us through all the features and nuances of the house so that we could comfortably use everything without having to figure stuff out and/or be worried about breaking anything. The house itself is beautiful and the location can't be beat. Highly recommended!
41014,715458,2011-11-14,370587,Jacob,"AMAZING!

We had our wedding at Kirstie's home and couldn't have asked for more.

Kirstie is an awesome Host with a professional approach. She is upfront about everything, responds quick to messages and was so helpful along the way. 

The house is big and cozy, set infront of the ocean, perfect for sunsets and tide pool exploring. Too many amenities to name, but you can be sure this is Central Coast living at it's finest."
41014,789534,2011-12-17,63696,Christine,"We had a great time at this beautiful house.  It was an ideal set-up for a family reunion; plenty of space, beautiful views and a gracious host.  
"
41014,1290577,2012-05-16,1919390,Lin,"We had a lovely time, enjoying the house, grounds, hot tub, pinball machine, and tide pools. Kirstie could not have been a better host-we felt pampered. "
41014,1695445,2012-07-13,2155653,Dodi,"Kirstie was a wonderful hostess - her home was beautiful and stocked with more than everything you would need. It is not your usual vacation condo - the feel of a loving home was evident. It is serene and beautiful in every way - very relaxing and quiet  with the waves lulling you to sleep. I will definitely be returning as soon as I can.

41014,1802933,2012-07-26,1867004,Tom,"This is an excellent place to stay. The house sits directly on the ocean and has its own access to the beach. The view is a wonder. The house is a mansion. It is equipped with everything you could possibly need for a great vacation. It's also really fun with hot tub, and games for everyone, It was a joy to stay here, I hope I'll have a chance to go back at some point."
41014,2388633,2012-09-24,501455,Stephanie,"Beautiful house, amazing location and Kirstie is very responsive and helpful. 
We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this house to anyone who is looking for a relaxing weekend at the beach. There is plenty of space for the whole family. The kitchen was big and well equipt and there was space for all 10 of us to be seated for dinner. The hot tub has a great view, the house is well stocked with games and has an awesome fire place. There's a walking trail along and the beach and a surf spot nearby. 
"
41014,2677795,2012-10-22,2592465,Leslie,"Wonderful home in a beyond beautiful location.  We held a small wedding ceremony here and it could not have been more perfect.  Accomodations were very nice, with too many ocean views to count.  The kitchen was great - fully stocked and roomy.  No need to leave the house for anything except the walking trail and golfing across the street.  Plenty of space for a two-family vacation rental.  Kirstie made everything easy.  We can't wait to go back!  "
41014,3056095,2012-12-11,3510171,Matt,"What a beautiful place!

Eight of us stayed at Kirstie's place for a December weekend. I can't say enough good things about it. The most striking features were the incredible view and the beach paths to private & public beaches right outside. The place itself was both large and well-furnished, with plenty of amenities and all the basics (cookware, dishes, towels, etc.). My fiancee still rhapsodizes about our stay.

Kirstie herself gave us a comprehensive walkthrough, and offered extras like a binder with information about local places.

We couldn't have asked for more. Thanks, Kirstie!"
41014,4636679,2013-05-17,4715787,Tina,"We had a wonderful stay at Kirstie's home. She gave us a full tour of the home when we arrived and was very nice to leave the local paper, invite us to a yoga class etc. The home has spectacular views and is convenient to everything on the Monterey Penninsula.  It's a super relaxing place. The kids loved the pin ball Machine and walks along the trail on the bluffs in the morning.  Thanks for such a relaxing trip Kirstie!  We will see you again soon. "
41014,5016145,2013-06-07,6593754,Soonbo,"Our group(12 people) rented place for corporate retreat. Everyone stayed comfortably and this place have movie room, ping pong table, pin ball machine, foots-ball for entertainment and best of all was the location you are literally own the beautiful ocean in front of you. we had wonderful and refresh time here and kirstie welcome us with great hospitality."
41014,5227459,2013-06-19,5108358,Chirapon,We loved our stay. Gorgeous home with a spectacular view. Great location for a retreat/getaway. I'd definitely love to come back some day.
41014,5504437,2013-07-03,3457967,Linda,"We had an incredible time at the Beach house.  It is setup to be fun, yet so very relaxing, everyone in our group was very appreciative of all the little touches that Kirstie does to make you feel welcome.  She is an incredible host, and staying at her home is a memory you will never forget.

"
41014,7252233,2013-09-13,8141691,Karen,"This house is amazing. It was kind of a funky layout but was very functional and had unparalleled views! The location was fantastic and in the mornings, some of us went cycling along 17-Mile Drive and others of us went for runs along the beach trails. We stayed here for a work off-site and I would stay here again."
41014,7503462,2013-09-23,3742329,Lynne,"Kirstie's house is exactly as she describes it.  Comfortable for a large group, including the family dog.  The house is well equipped and the location is unbeatable.  Kirstie is a great hostess and totally responsive."
41014,8779259,2013-11-18,7978679,Diana,"A totally delightful weekend. All of us enjoyed everything Kirstie did to make our stay forever memorable. As a perfect hostess, she thought of everything. Everyone wants to return and re-hike, re-run, re-explore, re-relax, and savor the minutes. This is truly a one-of-a-kind. Thank you Kirstie for thinking of all the details that made it the best!"
41014,8944343,2013-11-27,9106933,Roxene,"Where to begin? .Kirstie's beautiful place exceeded expectations.  The view of the Pacific is accessible from soft comfy sofa area, or adriondeck chairs, near to house or away, the bed where you awaken each morning. The Steinway plays beautifully.  The kitchen area is ample, the refrigerator holds an enormous amount.  Ice is plentiful. 
The floor plan is certainly unique.  But the rooms are large and comfy, the decor is lovely and often brought a smile to our lips. Why leave, when you are in paradise?  But if you don't wish to cook, The Fishwife is just a right turn out of the drive way and about a mile away.
Kirstie is highly responsive to any question or concern.  We had 12 folks with us, and all loved the place.  
The beds were very comfortable. 
We say dolphin pods and whales right out the door.  Just feel blessed to have had our wedding here.  "
41014,9014848,2013-12-02,1353180,Niraj,"Had a delightful Thanksgiving in Kirstie's lovely home. Our clan had the their most joyous holiday in Monterrey.
Will highly recommend this awesome place.
Thank you for making us most comfortable.
Cheers!"
41014,10035560,2014-01-27,10241020,Tiana,"This house is absolutely amazing! We came with family and friends to celebrate my mom's retirement. The views from each room are gorgeous, there is a trail right next to the house that you can take a walk on the beach and there is also a golf course and good resturants near by. Kirstie's hospitality was impeccable! She was so easy to communicate with and so friendly. We are definately coming to stay at her beautiful house again in the near future!"
41014,10917794,2014-03-13,58250,Jason,"We recently had a family reunion with 9 adults and 7 children at Kirstie's 
beautiful home in Pacific Grove. The house was 
so beautiful and had everything we could possibly need. The views from 
just about every room were breathtaking! We could have spent every minute 
just sitting on the couch and watching the waves crash on the rocks; but 
there are many things to do in the area and we spent a lot of time 
outdoors, hiking along the coast near the house, and at Big Sur and Point 
Lobos State Reserve. I would highly recommend Kirstie's home to any large 
group looking for a beautiful place to relax."
41014,11391035,2014-04-01,7702865,Qing,"We just had our wedding ceremony at Kirstie's beautiful house this past weekend. The view from the living room and the backyard is absolutely breath-taking. We originally planned to go to the Lover's Point to take more pictures, but our photographers said the view around the house is as good as any place in Pacific Grove, and we end up taking all our photos near and inside the house. The house is very comfortable and has everything we needed. The living room is spacious enough for the wedding ceremony. Kirstie has been very helpful all through; she even arranged a viewing of the house for us before our big day. We will certainly go back there for our future anniversaries. "
41014,12044769,2014-04-22,8305466,Randy,"My family celebrated our parents 50th wedding anniversary at Kirstie's home, and we couldn't have picked a better place to share this once in a lifetime event! The pictures don't lie the views from 90% of the house are amazing! The home felt like home as soon as we walked in. There were 11 of us and even at that number, the house was big enough that one could find a place to enjoy some peace and quiet while the kids enjoyed the game room, piano, hot tub or TV room. We especially enjoyed the beautiful and well cared for piano! Kirstie was very hospitable and attentive during our entire stay, an excellent host! This house is truly one of a kind."
41014,16880353,2014-08-04,1809483,Michael,"The house in Pacific Grove was one of those rare experiences where the actual place was better than it looked on the website. The place is a true gem, tucked out of the way from all other housing and overlooking a quaint state park with sea anemones, starfish, and even washed up violet jellyfish that don't stink. It is like out of a storybook. The house itself is tasteful with ample room and supplies to make even a rather large crowd feel comfortable. There are 4 bedrooms with ocean views, and they are magnificent since there is no development between the house and the ocean. 

Kirstie was lovely, providing a great tour of the house and also helping us get the most out of Monterrey throughout the weekend. I would recommend this place to anyone. "
41014,21865948,2014-10-26,9890615,Ron,Upon arriving Kirstie provided a thorough tour pointing out all the amenities and details of the house.  She provided us with a binder of the information she had told us about so we had reference if we needed it.  Kirstie was warm and welcoming and we felt more like family than strangers renting her home. 
41014,25263785,2015-01-11,53769,Amy,"If you're looking for a beautiful home with incredible views for a family getaway or special occasion, look no further. We just spent 2 nights there to celebrate my father-in-law's birthday, and a great time was had by all. We only wish we could have stayed longer. Kirstie provided lovely amenities and even left us a bottle of champagne in the fridge to help us celebrate. "
41014,25375806,2015-01-13,25895608,Toni,"Kirstie was such an excellent host, everything was perfect although we booked the place a day before arrival. The place was so peaceful and cozy with a very nice location. We really enjoyed our stay there!"
41014,27913803,2015-03-15,2813032,Scott,"This home was amazing. We had a small, 10 person wedding here and it worked perfectly as a venue.

Because of our schedules we needed to book the place without actually seeing it and were a bit worried about making a choice based on just photos and the reviews. When we saw it we realized we had absolutely nothing to worry about. The pictures don't do this home justice and everything was exactly what we were hoping for.

The location is unbeatable. You have you own private beach and there is a wonderful park just south of the house with walking paths, small rocky beaches and a gazebo. There is just one other house on the beach nearby and it's tucked out of sight so you're really surrounded by beautiful views of the ocean.

Each of the bedrooms are nicely furnished and each has it's own character. The 4 upstairs bedrooms have great open views of the beach and are really fun to wake up to. The master suite has a great open bathroom and access to a deck with more amazing views.

Two of the bedrooms are set up a little funny where you need to walk through a bedroom or an outside door to get to them. This might be a little awkward for groups of couples but would work very well for sets of families. In both those bedrooms there are full curtains for the bed areas so i'm sure you could make it work.

The kitchen was very well stocked and the living/dining area have another beautiful view of the water.

For our wedding ceremony we walked to a small area overlooking the water about a block away. We had great weather, but the living room would have also been a great spot for the ceremony if the weather didn't cooperate. 

We had a photographer and caterers come to the house and everything went really well. The caterers (Aqua Terra) have a restaurant just a few blocks away so it was very easy for them to come, set up and cook for us. Kirstie has a very well documented inventory of everything at the house. She even came and dropped off some extra stem-ware when we realized we needed more.

Overall I'm not sure how you could go wrong staying here. It's a beautiful home in an amazing location and we had an unforgettable wedding. We hope to be back many times for future anniversaries."
41014,28987899,2015-04-02,590624,Penelope,Kirstie was the most complete host we have ever encountered.  She answered every question.  We were there for my father's 80th birthday and everyone had such a great time that they didn't even want to leave the property.  The house is perfectly stocked with anything you could want from cooking equipment to music and media and entertainment.  And the setting couldn't be better.
41014,29154663,2015-04-05,12089345,Pamela,This was a fabulous well maintained property that fit our needs perfectly.  We rented the home for three nights to celebrate my 60th birthday with 11 family members and a special catered dinner.  The rooming accommodations were great with privacy for three couples and my mom as well as good accommodations for the four children ages 11-14.  Lots for the kids to keep entertained with as well as the unbeatable oceanfront experience.  All enjoyed time in the hot tub and a special treat of an arranged massage for three of us from Perrine.  The kitchen was very well appointed and very accommodating to the caterers.  I cannot think of a nicer place to stay with everyone together but still not on top of each other.  So glad that we planned to stay and eat there versus exploring the many local restaurants ~ cannot beat the view.
41014,29570499,2015-04-09,29601910,Michael,"Great house, great location, great host!  Book it now!!!  

That pretty much sums up our trip this last week in Pacific Grove.  First the location is pretty much as good as it gets.  This house is one of only a  couple that are ocean front in all of Pacific Grove!  It's truly something special that you don't find often.  

Minutes away from the Aquarium and some great restaurants.  (Red House Cafe for breakfast!!!, Pacific Thai also good, and Pavel's Backerei!!!)  We brought our bicycles and road 17 mile rd through pebble beach!  Amazing.  There is also a dirt nature trail right out the front door that goes along the ocean.   It's not like other beaches I've been to as there is lots of land between houses and it's left mostly in its pure form.  

The master king size bed was posturepedic and I was surprised to really enjoy the sounds of the ocean.  I'm a light sleeper but sleep great here.  It was very consistent due to the cove and was so relaxing!  Every bedroom but 2 had ocean views.  This place sleeps a lot of people very comfortably.  I'd highly recommend!  

The living room had a huge couch fireplace.  The sunsets from that room were amazing!  So relaxing and the ocean was just beautiful.  The pictures really don't do this place justice though they are very nice.  

We didn't really find anything that we'd like to change about the place.  It's been renovated and updated.  Perhaps the only thing negative I can think of is simply that it's exterior could use some paint or sealer in the next few years.  But really that's grasping at straws to find anything that wasn't just perfect.  

 Don't think you'll find another place as nice as this one.  Book it and be done with it.  The hours of searching are over.  We even extended our stay an extra day because we just couldn't leave.  Oh the house also has a whole house stereo that's connected to your phone via an app.  Super simple and a neat feature.  The host has this place dialed for ease of use! 

Best, Mike

P.S. The host provided tons of towels and extra blankets plus shampoo and conditioner and body soap in the bathrooms.  She was great!  "
41014,29904240,2015-04-14,19860388,Carol,"This home is fantastic with a million dollar plus view. You can not find a better home away from home. The house is equipped with anything that one might need. The surroundings are perfect, the house is very spacious and the hottub is a plus. Kirstie left a bottle of champagne in the fridge to help celebrate our son's wedding and the house plants made us feel very much at home. One family member slipped over a pocketbook and fell. Kirstie gave us a cold wrap to take with us on our travel back East.  We could not have asked for a better place for a family get to gether!!!  Thanks for everything !"
41014,30752144,2015-04-27,15894119,Carla,"Our family stayed at Kirstie's home during the week of the Big Sur Marathon -combining the race with a family vacation. Prior to booking this space I read a ridiculous number of reviews on countless properties-because I wanted it to afford a really special memory pool. This home was so captivating in the photos that I couldn't resist and I am so grateful that we chose this space. This is definitively a home-it feels like people have experienced life inside and that it has been cherished. If you are new or reticent about Airbnb this is a super way to experience a professional gracious host who has thought of everything. Kirstie is authentic and very attentive to your holiday needs. Beyond the nuts and bolts of the rental is the magical quality of this home and its surrounding sights. Monterey is a short gorgeous drive but the town of Pacific Grove is equally charming. Read the book when you get there it offers a ton of ideas for restaurants and activities. But most importantly, drink in the fantastical view in her backyard-it never ceases to take away your breath. Spending down time with people you love surrounded by astounding beauty in a totally unique space -it should be called Magic Cottage on the Coast. "
41014,32126156,2015-05-14,19005552,Ryan,"Kirstie and her house were wonderful. Easy check in, house was as we'd expected, but the views from house were spectacular. We conducted a two day facilitated strategic planning meeting in the living room for 4 of us and a good time was had by all and despite the amazing view we got a lot done. Thank you Kirstie! 

"
41014,32738531,2015-05-21,22731574,David,Kirstie was an outstanding host; super-friendly and helpful who immediately made us feel welcome and at home. Beach house is simply fantastic; prime oceanfront with awesome views with lots of room for everyone. Watching whales from hot tub on last night was one of many highlights!
41014,33373038,2015-05-27,30990009,Patricia,"My family spent a couple days in Kirstie's unbelievably awesome home celebrating our mom's birthday. We've already talked about coming back next year! Kirstie went over everything in detail and was a wonderful host. The views are amazing, the amenities are perfect for a family who likes to spend time together singing at the grand piano, playing pinball, foosball or ping pong, or just walking around the tide pools. Several of us got a massage from Perrine Adams – a wonderful and relaxing experience. Everyone in my family had a great time – how could they not in such an idyllic environment?!"
41014,36968552,2015-07-03,33648757,Spike,"Kirstie has an awesome house 50 yards from the waves with great sea views, lots of space and very well equipped. we really enjoyed our time here."
41014,50423471,2015-10-12,24398203,Steve,This house is absolutely stunning with the best location on the peninsula.  I would highly recommend this property and hope to stay again soon.

41014,54367477,2015-11-19,639943,Shari,"Wow!  This is an absolutely wonderful home.  We stayed here with extended family members from various parts of the country to celebrate my son's wedding.  I can't speak highly enough of this lovely home right on the shore of the ocean.  Kirstie the owner, was very proactive in communicating and keeping us updated, as well as providing us with things to do and places to see.  Her home is immaculate and so well stocked with ALL the necessities.  It was a joy to cook in the kitchen.  Having spent quite a bit of time using Airbnb, I can say that it isn't common to find a home as well supplied with so much to make a stay so comfortable.  The home is large with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, hot tub (which we would have loved to visit...perhaps next time), attached greenhouse, large living room and fireplace, a TV room with very large screen, ocean views from every room and a wonderfully stocked kitchen (great if you like to cook as we do).  We loved being lulled to sleep by the sound of the ocean and waking up to that sound as well.  This truly is a wonderful place to stay if you want to visit the Monterey/Pacific Grove/Carmel area.  Thank you Kirstie for allowing us to have the perfect place to stay!"
41014,55783591,2015-12-06,13030873,George,"What a great home, one of only two on the water side of the road. Our group of 10 loved the location and Kirstie's home. Kirstie greeted us and took us through the home so we knew how to take advantage of the home's numerous features, from 2 Sonos sound systems to the hot tub. And the hot tub was immaculate. 
Great beds, great views of the Pacific, incredible sunsets and we also saw two whales! All in all a great place to stay. "
41014,57746620,2015-12-29,33783189,Debra,"We had a wonderful birthday celebration for my husband's 70th birthday at your beautiful house. Couldn't have been better for our party of 8. Comfortable, beautiful, close to everything... a home away from home. We will definitely be back, probably every year. thank you Kristie and Eli!"
41014,59223862,2016-01-08,35738580,Stephane,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kristie's house, which we rented for our company's sales meeting. The set up of the house was perfect for our team, we used the huge dining/living room as a work space and the TV room for computer presentations. Of course the main feature of the house is its unique setting, with unobstructed views of the waves crashing 100 ft down below. The stormy weather provided us with a spectacular view during our work sessions, and we used the terrace and hiking path for short breaks. 

Kristie was great to work with. She was very clear in her instructions and accomodating to our schedule.

We unanimously recommend Kristie's house, and hope to be back!"
41014,64366576,2016-03-03,34140878,Andrew," Kirstie's house has an amazing view, from the couch you can comfortably have the fire going while you listen and watch the ocean. The view from the jacuzzi is also amazing. Good for 4 couples since 4 rooms are connected without doors, kind of like pass through kids' rooms. This house is a paradise to cook as her kitchen has all you can ask for."
41014,64894396,2016-03-08,5966596,Adam,gorgeous and unique ocean front view of protected seashore. attentive and thorough host.

This home has all the amenities..well-stocked kitchen with staples (loved the kitchen), comfortable beds, large living area...just home away from home..Kirstie made us feel so very welcome and ensured we had everything that we needed to make our stay comfortable and fun. We (5 couples) were all there for a wedding celebration.  We could not have chosen a better place to stay.  Amenities...big screen tv; music system, large, comfortable living room with a great fireplace (with firewood stocked), lovely greenhouse, hot tub overlooking ocean (we loved)....and I personally loved playing on her antique pinball machine!  Each bedroom was beautifully set up with towels and toiletries...a great touch. Such a fun home and wonderful hostess!  Thank you, Kirstie.  We hope to stay again."
41014,68333339,2016-04-04,6064129,Balint,"Amazing home with magnificent views in a stunning location. Kirstie was a terrific host, very responsive, accommodating and professional. Highly recommend.  "
41014,69188659,2016-04-10,5148095,Carolyn,"Absolutely magical. Kirstie is an incredible host - great communication throughout the entire process, thorough (and really fun) tour of the house, baskets in each room with towels and toiletries. The house and property is absolutely amazing. Our family had a great stay and there is already talk of coming back soon!"
41014,70203656,2016-04-17,37723177,Andrew,"The property was in a great location.  The house was clean and full of amenities.  We cooked our own food, and found that they had almost everything we needed!  We are already planning our trip back and hope that we have an even better vacation next year!  There are a lot of rules in renting this property, but all of them were reasonable."
41014,70645758,2016-04-19,66082264,Kashelle,"Kirstie was an excellent host! She was there to greet us when we arrived. Her tour was thorough and she made us feel very comfortable!! Her place is amazing!!!!! We arrived just before sunset and saw the most amazing views from the house!! We even saw whales! The house was well stocked, it was very spacious and beautiful. We brought our two kids and they had a blast!! There were great toys and they even have a secret fort in the garage! This isn't far the most amazing place we have ever stayed! We hope to be back soon! "
41014,77532156,2016-06-01,51365150,Phyllis,"We loved this house!  First of all, the view is SPECTACULAR!!!!  All of the rooms were extremely comfortable.  There were baskets soap and fluffy white towels. Kirstie was most welcoming, and was available to answer any questions.  The kitchen works really well for a large family.  We are a three generational family, and there was plenty for all of us to do:  games and a pinball machine in the house, and tide pools and walking/jogging paths along the beach.  We will stay here again."
41014,87395109,2016-07-19,40024798,Irene,"The house is awesome! The view unbelievable! Pictures do not do it justice.
Soap, creams, cleaning items, even laundry detergent was provided.
Kirstie was right there if we needed anything.
By far the most beautiful place we have ever stayed. We would definitely stay again."
41014,111059213,2016-10-30,47939727,Maureen,Kirstie is an excellent host.  We enjoyed the space and the location is amazing.  It's accessible to so many things but has a secluded feeling.  
41014,112176762,2016-11-04,90977812,Louis,"The house was every bit as advertised and then some. Unbeatable location and views. Hostess was great, helpful and easy to communicate with. The whole experience was easy."
41014,120775131,2016-12-11,94550980,Rose,"Kirstie was so hospitable. the home was unforgettable. 
love the baskets with bathroom essentials for each room and guest. the view is breathtaking. only problem is when you have to leave and go back to reality. Our entire group loved our stay cant wait to go back. "
41014,121760486,2016-12-18,7323676,Daniel,"Hard to imagine a more beautiful location in the Monterey Peninsula. This is one of only a handful of homes that exist on the ocean side of the Pacific Grove ocean-side roads. With miles of maintained trails one could walk all the way to Pebble Beach.

We stayed for two nights to celebrate my wife's birthday as a surprise to her. Our three kids and their spouses/friends were with us and we didn't really leave the house. There are some pretty good restaurants in Pacific Grove but when you are at such a beautiful location there's really no reason to leave except to hike the dune/ocean trails. The kitchen is fantastic and you can easily seat 10 at the amazing dining room table.

The great room looks out at the ocean and you'd think you were at an iMax theater watching the waves, the sea birds, the otters and the occasional whale.

I didn't get a chance to meet Kirstie (my kids did) but she was exceptionally communicative and helpful.

We'd return in a heartbeat!"
41014,125429802,2017-01-05,86396866,Pamela,"Kirstie's home is absolutely lovely and very comfortable. Her communication is prompt and friendly. I'm usually ready to go home after any vacation, but this time I was really sad to leave. I'm thinking about making this a yearly tradition! "
41014,128549732,2017-01-25,23783531,Luke,"Fantastic place, location is stunning, everything you could need is there and Kirstie is a great host."
41014,130713270,2017-02-07,56553280,Adam,Wonderful oceanfront home 
41014,137640198,2017-03-16,109158587,John,Stunning location. You will not want to leave except to walk on the beach outside your front door. No trouble getting great take out orders from local restaurants and fresh seafood from Monterey fish company to grill. My elderly father never had to leave his window seat and the accessible bathroom on first floor a big plus. Great stay.  
41014,138496101,2017-03-19,8591133,Jeff,"The house is gorgeous with lots of fun surprises, such as hidden bedrooms and games (pinball, ping pong). We couldn't have asked fore more. Kirstie was delightful and highly responsive. Thanks!"
41014,145535282,2017-04-18,40799367,Kirsten,"Expect to be pampered by staying in this exceptional home, from its location, to furnishings, games and fort for the kids down to the details....you'll never tire of looking!  Do not hesitate to be on the only true beachside rental in Pacific Grove!  "
41014,146747214,2017-04-23,95755844,Janet,"The location at Kirstie's house is out of this world! Being able to sit in the living room and see sea otters, whales and the waves was mesmerizing. The house was great for our large group and we had all the amenities we needed. We had a great stay!"
41014,148886985,2017-05-01,71493210,David,"This is a very top shelf property, where the pictures do not do justice to the views one sees from this property.  We would have no problem staying here again with friends and family."
41014,153030790,2017-05-19,25117663,John,"It is simply not possible to imagine a more dramatic view of the California coastline ... and one that is incredibly special, private, secluded and absolutely breathtaking. You will never find a more special place from which to create memories of a lifetime. Kirstie is the perfect host - providing a comprehensive orientation, being available should there be a need, and turning over her magical home for a truly stay of a lifetime along the most magnificient coastline in the world.  "
41014,153659351,2017-05-21,66959848,Artavia,"Kirstie's home was amazing.  My family and I were in town for our daughter's graduation.  The home was perfect for our celebration, very nice, comfortable and yet non assuming. All of the conveniences of home, and more...Keurig and traditional coffee pot, so many different dish choices to choose from.  The ocean view and easy access were amazing.  The only thing we could have done different was stay longer."
41014,186166572,2017-08-23,62052745,Lisa,An immaculately kept residence with breathtaking views and a sunset to die for! Kirstie goes through lengths to make the stay a memorable one!
41014,188177955,2017-08-28,94554158,Sharon,"This is a lovely, spacious home with the most gorgeous view you will ever enjoy. So close to the ocean you can hear the waves.  There are paths for walking, nearby beaches and tide pools to explore.  The house is spotlessly clean and has every amenity.  Kirstie is a wonderful host, who provides her guests with a relaxing, comfortable environment.  You will love staying here!"
41014,192895335,2017-09-11,25645495,Linda,"Kirstie's house was the perfect place for a girlfriends trip to play Pebble Beach!
There were 6 of us, so each of us got to have our own rooms so we could have some quiet time if need be!  
We did a lot of sight-seeing and saw some beautiful scenery but the most spectacular vista was looking out the back door of Kirstie's house! 
This was a bucket list trip  for all of us and staying at this house for 5 nights was the topping on the cake!!!!"
41014,226093173,2018-01-08,125576427,Meredith,"Great stay, can't wait to go back!"
41014,227893774,2018-01-16,41274007,Sarah,"We had a wonderful long weekend at Kirstie's home. The place is huge and the view of the ocean from the living room is incredible. Kirstie was there to greet us and show us how to use everything, and was really communicative during our stay if we needed anything. 

We cooked every meal in the home, and the kitchen was great for making big meals to share with our group. Each couple had their own bedroom, which was really nice. There are two bedrooms where you have to walk through one to get to the other, but it didn't bother us too much. Overall it was a super relaxing weekend."

41014,232364039,2018-02-04,84167852,Mark,What a fantastic place. Kirstie was great to deal with and made everything very special for us. We will rent it again. 
41014,238432290,2018-02-25,153636508,Jerome,The view and the fireplace where the outstanding features for us.
41014,244848838,2018-03-19,143613310,James,"It was absolutely spectacular watching the waves crash in our own “private cove”, with the resident sea otters playing and eating crabs in the water! We also saw harbor seals, pacific dolphins, and even a pod of whales cruising up the coastline.  Whether sitting in the living room, or outside in the comfy Adirondack chairs, the view was simply amazing.  The spaciousness of the home gave us the option to be together or find some private moments.  The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals for our large extended family.  We planned several outings during our stay, but found that we enjoyed the spectacular vistas at Rocky Shores so much that we ended up spending most of our time there.  It was a perfect, relaxing vacation experience.  We cannot imagine any better combination of location, comfort, and amenities than we experienced staying at Kirstie’s!"
41014,245815059,2018-03-23,13199777,Cathie,The house was absolutely perfect for our group of nine old (very old) college friends.  Everything we could possibly want or need was there.  We enjoyed watching the waves break during a wild storm from the comfort of the living room fire fireplace. Even the gal with physical issues was accommodated with a downstairs bedroom and handicapped bathroom.  An A-1 house!

41014,254446271,2018-04-16,14233130,Ben,"This is one of the best AirBnB properties we have ever experienced.  The location is beyond phenomenal.  From the 4 aquarium passes, abundance of towels / supplies, and very thorough instructions, everything has been thought through.  This is a truly special property, and it was an amazing place to gather a group of people for the week.  Thanks so much!!"
44515,81787,2010-08-20,196558,Raychell,Our stay at the Matheson's was outstanding! Blake really made our experience perfect. The cottage is so cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was delicious and the delectable little cookies that were left for us will have me running back very soon :) We took a very short walk from the cottage down to the ocean and watched the sun set. A wonderful couple and a beautiful place to stay.
44515,83477,2010-08-23,200563,Josh,Erika and Blake were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. Their cottage and property are beautiful and the location is perfect. They went out of their way to help us have a great weekend getaway! It's the little extra touches that make this a 5-star experience.
44515,88071,2010-08-31,201451,Michael,"We had a wonderful time at the Guest House.  Very cute place.  The hosts were so gracious and tended to our every need.  The breakfasts were delicious. Would recommend the experience to anyone.

Mike and Lee Ann."
44515,88704,2010-09-01,191318,Kelly,"Erika and Blake were great and the cottage was the perfect, cozy getaway.

Erika and I were in touch via texts as to the details of our arrival (we were running late and she let me know of a nearby tree that was possibly affecting their power- turned out power was restored before we arrived). The easy communication was much appreciated. 

Erika and Blake ensured a great balance of privacy and attentiveness. They greeted us, got us settled in, offered restaurant suggestions, showed us the breakfast menu (adorable!) and were otherwise never seen (well, Erika met us with cookies as we were leaving for our beach walk... what a nice treat!). The cottage is set up with a private entrance and feels very secluded. The grounds were lovely and the walk to the beach was easy and relaxing. 

We would definitely stay here again and offer hearty recommendations for this cottage and Blake and Erika!  
"
44515,95974,2010-09-13,189659,Adam,"I traveled to Pacific Grove with my girlfriend to participate in the city’s annual triathlon, and stayed here for two nights.  Overall, the rental experience was fantastic.  Erika is especially accommodating, responsive and hospitable.  We were provided (delicious) complementary breakfasts each morning, the place was immaculate and the bed is really comfortable!  Not only that, but the cottage is a stone’s throw (i.e. a couple minutes by car) from downtown, the Monterey bay Aquarium, restaurants and shops, etc.  Highly recommended."
44515,105544,2010-09-26,225279,Trent,"I wish I could give this place 10 stars.
This is the coolest little cottage in one of the most amazing places on the planet.
Only to be made even better by our lovely Hosts.
To top it all of  we ate the best breakfast of our drive from LA to SF.

Thanks for making us feel so welcome.

"
44515,107362,2010-09-28,206328,Hillary,"Erika and Blake's guest house is so special! I wanted to stay forever. The bungalow has all the accommodations of a four star hotel, tucked away on their beautiful grounds three minutes from the ocean -- this New Yorker's fantasy of life of California. They hit way above the mark, welcoming us with cookies and recommendations and delivering a thoughtfully catered (and delicious!) breakfast in the morning. I bet they throw an awesome dinner party.

"
44515,113091,2010-10-06,241049,Emma,"We had a great stay at this B&B! Private cottage, lovely surrounds and extremely friendly hosts. Simple yet professional touches such as welcoming cookies, restaurant recommendations and alike made for a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks again Erika and Blake!"
44515,116251,2010-10-11,235491,Baz & Shari,"WOW! what can I say....... We had a great time!  Erika and Blake are awesome people they know how to treat their guest.  The cottage was perfect had everything we wanted plus more, the breakfast was awesome we couldn't get over how great the eggs where and the awesome walnut toast :) If I could I would give Erika and Blake more then 5 stars it was better then staying at a 5 star hotel. The location was perfect we spent the weekend with them for our 19th wedding anniversary and we couldn't ask for more we loved it, didn't want to leave at all. We will be back to stay again. Thank yo so much again and again........ Oh yes and the cookies are the bomb LOVED them :)"
44515,120743,2010-10-17,243560,Greg,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time here, and Erika and Blake were very hospitable, times ten. The extra large bed was a great treat for our travel-weary bones, and the full kitchen was a great great bonus. Killer location, killer breakfast and cookies, and killer space. Will definitely look them up next time we roll into town!"
44515,126105,2010-10-24,218245,Tom & Gemma,"We had a great stay with Erika and Blake in Pacific Grove.  The cottage is at the back of their garden and is absolutely beautiful.  It has a very comfy bed, two armchairs, a kitchen area and a shower room.  It is really pretty, spotlessly clean and feels very homely.

Erika and Blake are both friendly and make you feel welcome.  Erika cooked us a delicious breakfast which we ate sitting on their patio and admiring their garden!  

I wish we could have stayed for longer and we will definitely make a return visit next time we are in California.

Ps. The home baked cookies are really good!  "
44515,131517,2010-11-01,237946,Shannen,"Staying at Erika and Blake's cottage is everything all the other reviews raved about and more.  First of all, the cottage is adorable and the location is unbeatable.  Just a short walk to some of the most beautiful coastline in California.  A friend and I stayed there and every time we walked through the gate to go back to the cottage, she fittingly said ""It's as magical as the first time"" :)  It really is such a cute and warm little place...straight out of a Martha Stewart magazine...and if that's the case Erika may as well be Martha but way better looking.  As everyone has stated, breakfast and the cookies are ah-maze-ing!  A bonus is that Erika's great to hang out with...I was alone my first day and we got to spend some time together and she was so sweet and so fun I really hope to see her again someday.  It really shouldn't be a problem since my friend and I are already planning a trip back!  "
44515,136477,2010-11-09,274789,Gary,"Greetings Reader,  Treat yourself to a great retreat experience at the Green Gate cottage.  Erika and Blake are excellent hosts, welcoming, warm and open.  Erika is a total jewel full of charm, intelligence, and smiles.  The cottage is very sweet, quiet and restful.  Breakfast is something to look forward to daily.  You will be pleased with all the comforts of home and more.  Great neighborhood in PG and very close to the ocean.  You can hear the surf quietly at night. Have a peaceful stay. "
44515,142227,2010-11-21,275989,Mike," My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the cottage. 

The cottage was very cozy, comfortable and clean. The 

location is good. Its within walking distance to 

Asilomar beach. We enjoyed our bike ride from the 

cottage to cannery row, making several stops to enjoy

the scenery. Erika and Blake were excellent hosts. The

breakfast and cookies were fantastic. We look forward 

to coming back! "
44515,147798,2010-12-01,107578,Sonya & Jackson,"We really enjoyed our stay at Erika & Blake's cottage. Erika was very accommodating, sweet and hospitable. We loved her homemade cookies & breakfast. The location was perfect for a relaxing beach vacation with our 4 legged babies. We would love to visit again!"

44515,157599,2010-12-23,307090,Vanessa And Dave,"Our stay at Erika and Blake's was totally awesome! From the beautiful cottage, delicious food and their really cool animals, it was a truly memorable vacation. The cottage was equipped with all the necessities to cook, read a good book, to sit with a glass of wine and do a tiny bit of work. You guys have a one of a kind property and great hospitality. Hope to stay with you again!"
44515,159676,2010-12-29,200087,Meryl,"I stayed in Erika and Blake's cottage for five nights over the Christmas holiday. It was lovely to spend the days with my grandchildren and then have their cozy cottage to retreat to in the evenings. Each morning began with a very tasty breakfast that included fresh fruit, herbed eggs (I only chose the granola and yogurt once), and Erika's lovely Walnut bread. In the late afternoons or evenings there was a delicious cookie waiting for me--I gained a pound or two but it was entirely worth it! Okay, maybe the big dinners had something to do with it, too.

The property is located very close to the beach, so my little buddy and I went to the beach every morning, and it is also walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove--if you're used to walking. The patio and surrounding property will make you think you've woken up in a different country. I stayed in a B&B similar to this one in Aix en Provence a few years ago--only the bed wasn't nearly as comfortable, and the hosts not quite as friendly. Erika delivered breakfast each morning and our few minutes of conversation were very delightful. They both were excellent hosts, very friendly and accomodating, but also unobtrusive.

Since I am a regular visitor to the area, I'm sure I will stay here again. Don't hesitate--you'll have a lovely stay! "
44515,161299,2010-12-31,141119,Terence,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Green Gate Cottage.  Erika was wonderful during our entire stay and if you read the other reviews (all 100% on the money) you will pick up on words like cookies, beach, and welcoming which are just a few reasons why you should stay there.  We are so happy we do not live too far away so we hope to visit again soon. "
44515,164081,2011-01-03,252514,Hoki,"Far exceeded expectations.   Erika & Blake's cottage was very comfortable, quiet, 2 blocks from the water.  The hosts were very kind, generous and even prepare a delicious breakfast each morning that they bring out and drop off for you....a nice touch.  This place is great, you will not be disappointed "
44515,176080,2011-01-30,307789,Liz,"Our trip to a conference at Asilomar became an idyllic vacation thanks to this great space and our welcoming hosts! Really just a short hop to the beach and a 5-minute walk to the conference grounds, I feel like we couldn't have found a better spot to stay. The cottage is comfortable, beautiful, private, and well appointed. It was wonderful to have a place to cook, and the breakfasts Erika provided were amazing!  "
44515,176916,2011-01-31,115614,Katie,"Absolutely wonderful stay. Erika and Blake have such a beautiful home and the cottage they provide is very private and cozy. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. There are homemade cookies upon arrival and breakfast menu to pick out what you would like and when for you to hang on the door for morning. So easy! The eggs, coffee and walnut bread were yum! There are fresh flowers scattered around the cottage and a wonderful selection of magazines to choose from if you feel like lounging. The beach is in short walking distance as well as Fishwife Seafood where we walked to dinner. We had a really relaxing weekend. Thanks you Ericka and Blake. We hoe to return. "
44515,179177,2011-02-07,74466,Carla,"Erika and Blake put many thoughtful details into this cottage making it feel like home.  We looked forward to the breakfast each morning and Blake's strong coffee.  There were magazines, books, and recommendations by the hosts for places to eat and visit.  

It was great to be able to bring our dog along too.  Since the hosts own dogs this might not be a good pick if you aren't an animal lover, but our dog loved playing with their toys around the yard.  The grounds are nice and private both from neighbors.  Blake made us all feel welcome without being overbearing, and we look forward to meeting Erika next time too.        "
44515,180335,2011-02-09,153476,Shaun,This place is awesome!  We are planning a return to stay longer.  Home made breads and cookies and delicious scrambled eggs.  It is just such a beautiful area and this cottage is in the best part of the best neighborhood in Pacific Grove.
44515,184574,2011-02-19,371613,Piers,All the positive reviews are completely deserved! My girlfriend & I stayed one brief night before an extended weekend camping. It was raining when we left and Erika even asked if we wanted to borrow a tarp!  Special people & location. Thank you!
44515,186441,2011-02-22,352894,Erin,"We had a lovely stay over President's Day weekend.  Erika was very helpful in providing restaurant recommendations pre-trip and the places we made it to were great.  Blake welcomed us and gave us the lay of the land,  The cottage is cozy, clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was amazing each morning and I could go on and on about the cookies!  What a nice treat to be welcomed by upon arrival. The cottage is walking distance to the beach and also to town (if you don't mind walking a bit). I highly recommend staying here.  Their dogs are cute too!"
44515,197489,2011-03-12,428605,Kathy,"Erika and Blake's cottage is a gem hidden away on their property with your own private courtyard garden area. We enjoyed a sublime breakfast of perfectly scrambled eggs,homemade walnut toast,seasonal fruit and dark full bodied coffee each morning outside the cottage.The hosts are charming,helpful and respectful.
The interior is cozy,clean and tastefully decorated.The blue and white theme gives it an elegant yet casual cottage feel. There is plenty of light and the windows and doors open if needed for the fresh sea (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a magical getaway for me and I find myself fantasizing about returning soon!"
44515,198031,2011-03-13,21292,Tom,"Where to begin?  The hosts were gracious and accommodating. The location was ideal, in a residential neighborhood just blocks from the specatular coast, and close enough to hear the wave in the evening,   The cottage was charming and hospitable. It had everything we needed, including a private sitting area in the gardens as well as the powerful and hot shower. Fresh camillia flower by the bed. Calla lilies in the kitchen. 

One of several highlights was the over the top breakfast, cooked to order, at brought to our cottage at a  prearranged  time. There were small details, such as the segmented bowls of tangerines with a couple of delicate mint leaves on top that showed the care and attentiveness of the hosts. 

I hope they can keep up the genuinely gracious accommodations as we hope to be back in a few months. "
44515,203701,2011-03-20,74466,Carla,"We enjoyed another excellent stay at Erika and Blake's cottage in Pacific Grove.  They really are the most accommodating hosts, and we noticed they did some upgrades just in the past month.  
The cottage is adorable, with unique flowering grounds, and an easy walk to the beach.  They are also conveniently located to the local bus.  The breakfast is something to look forward to, and they dried the patio cushions before breakfast so we could eat outside.  It is those kind of details that really made for a perfect stay despite some rain.  "
44515,204630,2011-03-21,376229,Yekaterina,"We had a great time at Erika&Blake's! The place is truly charming, the hosts are friendly, the bed is soft and big enough for the three of us (our 2-year-old slept with us too), and the breakfast cooked by the hosts and delivered right to the door was organic and tasty! If we ever come back to Monterey, we will definitely stay here again!"
44515,216037,2011-04-03,445879,Kristen,"My boyfriend and I had such a good time at Erika & Blake's cottage! They are seriously the sweetest and friendliest people you will ever meet. The cottage was adorable, the breakfast was delicious, and their hospitality is unmatched. Plus, Erika makes these chocolate chip cookies that blow your mind, and I am a cookie snob! :) The cookies were so good that I keep having dreams about them, haha. Erika and Blake go out of their way to make your vacation relaxing and enjoyable. Thanks so much for an enjoyable stay."
44515,216621,2011-04-04,391980,Gregory,"Our stay in Erika and Blake's cottage was perfect! We loved the cozy feel of the cottage, the homemade cookies, the amazing breakfast, and of course our hosts! Everything was neat, clean, and decorated beautifully. The cottage is in a great location: close to the beach and within walking distance of an excellent restaurant where we had dinner -- Passionfish. We can't imagine a better value and would love to stay there again in the future. "
44515,223095,2011-04-11,448660,Timothee,"We spent a great week-end at Erika and Blake's place! Their place is fantastic: great homey feel, big backyard with a lot of flowers, *very* close to the ocean which makes it the only sound you'll hear while having your breakfast in the sunny patio. (that and the birds)

It was great to get away for the week-end and we couldn't ask for a better place to stay at."
44515,230696,2011-04-18,486872,Marla,Very charming cottage in back of the owner's residence. My friends and I had a great girls' weekend trip in Monterey. Thanks Blake and Erika!

Breakfast was great, absolutely love their front garden that we can sit in.  Will definitely stay there again!!!"
44515,254277,2011-05-07,481203,Samir,"We had a wonderful time. Pacific grove is a great alternative to other nearby towns - it's very relaxed, has excellent access to the beach, no crowds. The cottage itself is beautiful. Tucked away behind the main house you'll have your own outdoor porch area filled with flowers. Feels very secluded and quiet. The bed, bathroom, and small kitchen in the cottage are all just right. We will definitely stay here again!"
44515,256798,2011-05-09,393754,Karen,"Simply Perfect!

This was our first ""Airbnb"" reservation and I have to say it was simply perfect. What a fabulous stay we had in this charming Pacific Grove cottage and with such friendly and welcoming hosts. Erika & Blake provided everything needed for a perfect, quiet romantic getaway.  The cottage is so warm, adorable and with all the comforts of home. The garden setting is very peaceful and tranquil.  We enjoyed Erika's delicious breakfast every morning and the easy walk to the beach in the evenings...We will be back soon!
"
44515,263250,2011-05-14,142701,Chris,"We had a fantastic time staying at Erika and Blake's lovely cottage in Pacific Grove. It's everything the description, (and the other reviews), say it is. Very clean, well-kept, and cozy, and located on an incredible property. Very proximate to everything you'd want to do in the Monterey area.

The hosts are awesome too - they went out of their way to make sure that we had a perfect vacation.

Highly recommended."
44515,269906,2011-05-18,21148,Dan,"This cottage was completely awesome in every way. It was the highlight of our trip, and the nicest place we've ever rented through AirBnB. I look forward to making it back there some day. "
44515,275682,2011-05-23,482601,Cheryl,"Sadly, I was forced to cancel my booking 5 days before arrival so I never got to stay in this delightful place. The hosts were very gracious about my cancellation. I hope to stay with them when I finally do make it to California."
44515,277977,2011-05-23,608011,Cayce,"The cottage is super cute and even has a small kitchen (with a gas range, no less) and a lovely outdoor seating area -- it is very special. Erika was warm and welcoming, breakfast was great, and we really enjoyed our stay!  "
44515,280051,2011-05-24,496819,Inge,"I really enjoyed my stay in Pacific Grove with Erika, Blake and their gorgeous dogs. 

The cottage is charming, extremely comfortable, private and squeaky clean, and leaves you wanting for nothing. All the things are there for cooking, plus you get some great tips from Erika about where to eat locally.

Thanks for having me guys! Next time I'm in the US, I'll definitely check availability. "
44515,285040,2011-05-28,564940,Diane,"The owners were very low key and arriving, staying and leaving was all very simple and easy.  They were very responsive to my telephone and email questions.  The room was great, super clean, wonderful bed, linens, nice bathroom products, okay shower, and the garden just outside the room was charming and private.  The breakfast was very good - good strong coffee, cream, delicious herb scrambled eggs, walnut bread and fresh fruit, and brought to our little garden by the host at the time requested.  The beach is 3 blocks away and jaw dropping beautiful, although I couldn't really hear it from the cottage as I think they advertised.  And walking around from the cottage thru the neighborhood early in the morning was a nice way to see the other houses and the flora and fauna (lots of deer).  Easy to get to the town and have a nice dinner (short drive, doable walk) and easy to get onto the 17 Mile Drive out to Pebble Beach which costs around $9 and isn't particularly scenic, except for once you get to Pebble Beach, which is again jaw droppingly gorgeous.  I would stay here again, especially if I had my dog with me next time, since it's dog friendly.  There are several inns and fireplace cottages along the same street, though, so check those out too, unless you are really into staying at someone's home."
44515,299651,2011-06-06,500345,Hoyle,"With a daughter in Seaside Highlands, we wanted to find a location close enough to visit, but far enough away to allow both daughter and parents to have their privacy.  Erika and Blake's charming cottage proved to be perfect.  The secluded courtyard and well appointed ""studio"" were a pleasant surprise, but the real pleasure was Erika's smiling personality as she provided a nourishing and filling breakfast daily.  When we told Erika we would be pushing off for our home in Birmingham, Alabama early and so would not be requiring anything on the final day, she left warm cookies on our windshield with a note wishing us ""safe travels""...hard to beat that kind of caring...."
44515,303345,2011-06-07,374382,Sung,"We enjoyed staying at Erika&Blake's a lot. The room was clean, cozy, and cute. We could see very professional touch - from immaculate bed sheet, shampoo, towel, array of magazines, and moreover, delicious cookies waiting for you when you enter the room. We especially liked the small garden we own to ourselves. It's also very private.

Location is perfect, too. Walk just 1 minute out of the house, and you see the ocean.

Last but not least, you should not miss Erika's breakfast. Yummy!"
44515,313394,2011-06-14,419580,Mathew,"We had an excellent stay in the pacific grove area. The cottage was a prefect refuge to get away. It was so close to the beach and the downtown area. We spent very little in our car during our stay, we managed to stay on foot and cycle around. thanks Erika and Blake.   Matt & Sarah"
44515,318783,2011-06-17,485174,Mike,"This was our first airbnb booking and we really enjoyed the whole experience.  Prior to arriving, Erika and Blake were quick to respond to questions.  When we arrived, Erika met us and showed us around and, best of all, had fresh cookies waiting for us!

The room was clean and nice, the location was great and the price was the best deal in town by far.  They served breakfast each morning with options of what we wanted (yogurt/granola or eggs) and both were great.  I would highly recommend their place to anyone that is staying in the Pacific Grove area.

Will definitely be staying there again when we're in town."
44515,323866,2011-06-20,563636,Rebecca,"Our stay at Erika and Blake's cottage was truly wonderful! We arrived, as others have noted, to amazingly delicious cookies and a warm and inviting space--clean, beautifully decorated, fully-equipped kitchen, and the fresh ocean air. After learning that I wasn't able to eat dairy, they graciously adapted breakfast--which was beyond AMAZING (particularly the local eggs)--to accommodate my diet. And, upon leaving, Erika baked me some special, dairy-free cookies. Overall, our visit was truly above and beyond our expectations. We'll certainly return again and have already told several dear friends of the cottage. Thank you Erika and Blake for making our first trip since our daughter's birth a wonderful experience!!!"
44515,327203,2011-06-21,676108,Sarah,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been better. Erika & Blake's guest house was sooo adorable! From the decor to the homemade cookies and breakfast, everything was simply amazing. She even brought treats for my dog! My mom was a little skeptical of staying at someone's house, but was definitely glad we did. 

The bedding was really comfortable and I loved being so close to the beach. I'd definitely recommend a morning run at Asilomar State beach. Next time I head down to the area I hope to stay here again. Thanks for your hospitality! "
44515,332247,2011-06-24,703299,Karen,"Loved Erika and Blake's cottage.  Once we learned our way around, we realized how close we were to everything; 5 minute walk to the ocean and Asilomar State Park with lots of walking paths; 5-10 drive to the aquarium, good food, etc.  Quiet, secluded small cottage in their large, beautiful, flowery back yard.  Saw many other hotels/places to stay and knew we had found the best place.  Great hosts, great breakfasts.  Loved the whole experience.  Highly recommend.  "
44515,333350,2011-06-25,629441,Thalia,"A wonderful, tranquil place to stay, beautifully kept and charming hosts.  Highly recommended."
44515,335016,2011-06-26,321054,David,An idyllic place to spend a romantic weekend!
44515,337801,2011-06-27,509804,Nancy,"Beautiful place in Pacific Grove! I booked this cottage for my son and daughter-in-law for the night of their wedding. The privacy was wonderful and the hosts were very accomodating when I wanted to drop off the newlywed's luggage early and leave a cake for them. 

Daughter-in-law's comments are, ""It was a beautiful, comfortable, homey cottage. The amenities were only a small part of it's essence. We got to make a wonderful memory because of them. Also, they cooked an amazing breakfast for us!""

Communication with the hosts was excellent. Reservation and payment were easy. Although the directions were confusing because of streets changing names, the directions were very accurate.

Thanks, Erika and Blake, for making this an easy experience!"
44515,347617,2011-07-02,601849,Alaina,"After our night at their cottage, we can see why Erika and Blake have so many wonderful reviews. The cottage was adorable, very clean, and in a great location. Erika and Blake's property had so much character, I was in love with all of the details. The homemade cookies and breakfast were outstanding. We really wished we could have spent more time there. If we're ever back in the area, we'll definitely return."
44515,351321,2011-07-04,602083,Lauren,"We loved this place!!  The cottage is adorable, beautifully decorated, in the most ideal location, and the hosts are awesome!  Breakfast was delicious and Erika's cookies are wonderful.  Erika and Blake really know how to run a great b&b.  We will definitely be staying here again next time we take a trip to the Peninsula!  "
44515,355456,2011-07-05,758343,Jay,"Great Guesthouse, huge private yard area, fantastic coffee in room, and great breakfast provided. Erika was a great host! three blocks from the beachand great running / cycling along the ocean. took dogs to carmel lease free city beach. dinner at ""red house cafe"" very special - everything was excellent. awesome trip. We will definitely be back. "
44515,357025,2011-07-06,425094,Huy,"The passion that Erika and Blake have for running a wonderful BnB is apparent when you merely walk into the beautiful brick-paved courtyard that is populated with various well-tended flowers and plants. From there, you pass into your own private, smaller court and then into a beautifully furnished cottage. The bed is comfortable, the location is peaceful, and the air is fresh. You get all of this even before you get the delicious breakfast, delivered at a time that you specify! Great experience. We'll be back and will happily recommend this to others."
44515,363231,2011-07-09,778360,Karen,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was great!  The cottage was so cute and comfortable and it was so nice to have a place to stay with a dog where she was safe and free to roam a little.  
Blake was a great host, friendly and helpful!  I hope to return again!
"
44515,365862,2011-07-11,625342,Angela,"Charming and cozy little cottage in a lovely garden setting.  Very pet friendly, our doggies loved the garden area.  Erika and Blake are truly gracious hosts and sweet as can be.  Many thanks for their attention to detail."
44515,369285,2011-07-12,743131,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful time. Everything was perfect. We wished we could have stayed longer! Erika has a great eye for detail. Breakfast was lovely, the grounds are lovely. We plan on returning and telling all our friends. Thanks again."
44515,371431,2011-07-13,783052,Emily,"Erika and Blake's cottage was super comfortable, very clean, and had just the right amount of privacy for us. We stayed one night, and were greeted with a tour of the yard and cottage, as well as the tasty cookies you see mentioned in other reviews. 

With the well kept cottage and the breakfast/coffee we were served in the morning, we felt like we were at a true Bed and Breakfast. Definitely a wonderful stay and we'd do it again. "
44515,376250,2011-07-16,723093,Alice,"What an amazing place to stay. We feel like we found a real gem here. The place was completely separate from the main house and very private. We had our own little courtyard where we could sit and have our breakfast - which was amazing! Each day we could select what we want and it would be waiting for us every morning. The bed was so comfy! Plus yummy cookies everyday at teatime. The host also, we super friendly and very helpful."
44515,378626,2011-07-17,770854,Bradley,"This cottage is absolutely wonderful.  It is the perfect romantic hideaway for the Monterey/Carmel experience:  a charming space with an impeccable interior, a secluded patio, and a king size bed.  Moreover, Erika and Blake are excellent hosts.  Everything they do has just the right touch and we feel fortunate to have a place where we hope to return summer after summer. "
44515,380406,2011-07-18,583851,Sean,We had a great stay at this cottage in Pacific Grove. Erika was such a wonderful host. She consistently went above and beyond over the course of the weekend. The cottage was absolutely beautiful and no detail was spared. We wish we could have stayed longer.
44515,385555,2011-07-20,760052,Callie,"We had a wonderful stay in Erika and Blakes cottage, the garden and house were beautiful and the breakfast's delicious.   I'd recommend it to anyone, it's a lovely little place.  "
44515,388958,2011-07-22,747406,Neemu,"Erika and Blake have an amazing cottage. They are both so warm and friendly and we could not have had a better experience. My husband and I are both vegans and they made a lovely vegan breakfast of homemade bread, scrambled tofu, and fresh fruit. It was unbelievably delicious. And Erika's vegan chocolate chip cookies are like no other. She even made a few for us to take on the road at the end of our stay! The cottage is beautiful and opens up to a gorgeous patio and garden. This was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend a stay there! "
44515,395274,2011-07-25,733179,Terry,A great place to stay!! I almost hate to share the news. If people caught on to it the next time we're in the area it might not be available. Very charming little guest house with all the creature comforts of home and more!! Breakfast in the morning and yummy cookies treats. We truly enjoyed our stay. Thank you.. Terry and Carol Blair
44515,400976,2011-07-27,537107,Steve,"The cottage is exactly as described.  Wonderful large bed, delicious organic breakfast w/ homemade treats. Our hosts were terrific -- from the moment we arrived to breakfast the next morning.  They were helpful in finding a place for dinner that night and how to best walk to the beach. And they weren't intrusive or pushy -- they helped when we needed help and otherwise let us be.  Truly a great experience."
44515,403912,2011-07-29,122530,Erica & Chance,"Erika and Blake's cottage was charming. Just as it looks in the pictures, it was immaculate and nicely decorated. It's also pretty private; to get there, you have to walk past the main house, but it's separated by a lovely courtyard and still feels secluded. Breakfast was delicious. "
44515,407436,2011-07-30,849666,Julia,"Erika & Blake's guest house is truly wonderful! It is located in a beautiful yard with flowers and berries. The room is very clean and charming with nice details like magazines, lavender soap, a list of restaurant recommendations in the area and lovely homemade cookies on arrival. In addition to this Erika served us a superb breakfast in the morning! We had a perfect stay!"
44515,408803,2011-07-31,782948,Dee,"Me and my friend were having a girls weekend. I brought along my dog and us ladies soaked up the cuteness of Erika's cottage.  The place is adorable, private, and pet friendly.  Erika was extremely accommodating to our pet requests, and very responsive to emails and messaging.  Couldn't ask for a better host. 

It would be a great cottage for a couple's getaway.  Highly recommended."
44515,417107,2011-08-03,696020,Sandi,"Wow, very comfortable, clean and quaint. The bed was very comfortable. We had a great nights sleep. Very quiet neighborhood as well. Eriika's home cooked omelets very tasty as well as the infamous cc cookies. I can easily recommend to anyone. I will definitely be back."
44515,421406,2011-08-05,793471,Joanna,"Our stay at Erika & Blake's cottage was amazing! The only problem that we had was that we didn't stay longer. From the charming garden, to the secluded patio, to the decorating and of course the cookies and food- everything was top notch. AND- what we appreciated most about Erika & Blake was that they were super responsive and quick to communicate, which can be rare on Airbnb.
We have already recommended their cottage to friends and family."
44515,425234,2011-08-07,442891,Lilie,"We've had a great stay with Erika, 
Cottage is spacious, very clean and well decorated.
Location is great in Pacific Grove.
Erika is a great host: she helped us all through our stay with restaurants, visits...
Breakfast is delicious and all organic.
We stayed in many airbnb places this summer, and Erika's cottage was by far the best, and worth some 5* hotels we've stayed at before."
44515,428389,2011-08-08,786259,Paloma,"I don't know where to begin! Our whole experience with Erika and Blake's cottage was extremely positive. The space was clean, sunny and very cute-- all the details on the walls and around the place were clearly well thought out. We were grateful to be able to cook a full meal in the kitchenette, which was stocked with everything we would need, herbs, silverware, knives, all kinds of bowls and plates, mixing bowl, etc. We felt attended to the perfect amount as well. The morning breakfast was delicious, served on a beautiful tray. We got to enjoy it in our private outdoor garden, listening to all kinds of birds chirping. This was truly a getaway from the city and has spoiled us for any next Airbnb place we stay. Thanks!"
44515,443078,2011-08-14,539943,Isomi,"We couldn't say enough good things about our stay! The weather was pretty overcast, but with a great breakfast every morning and warm cookies in the afternoon, it didn't even matter. Plus our dog got to hang out with his two friendly host dogs, which was a definite bonus. The fire pit was perfect in the early evenings, and the huge bed made going home a little bit hard. We truly can't wait to go back!"
44515,447637,2011-08-15,887272,Danielle,"Our stay was very enjoyable! Ericka made us a lovely breakfast, and we were greeted by the sweetest dogs, ""Maude and Morty"".
Their property is beautiful, and well worth the cost!
We will most definitely stay at their cottage again in the future.
As we attended a wedding in Big Sur, and had an extremely long drive, the end to this day was very restful!
Many thanks to Ericka and Blake!!!
Danielle, Brian and Lincoln."
44515,499463,2011-09-04,16213,Marie,"Erika&Blake's cottage is absolutely lovely ! It is beautifully decorated, has everything you need, and is 5 minutes walk to the beach. Erika & Blake are both very accomodating, very easy to communicate with and make everything for you to feel like home. The breakfast is totally delicious, so are the cookies ! Nice home, nice people, five stars experience. Thank you !"
44515,501754,2011-09-05,728692,Audrey,"We had a lovely time, albeit too short of a stay. Erika and Blake were gracious hosts and very accommodating. Breakfast was superb as were the accommodations. We would stay again in a heartbeat and would recommend staying at the cottage for anyone planning a trip to the Monterey area."
44515,510069,2011-09-07,556538,Jack,"Thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay in this lovely little cottage.  Most comfortable bed, delicious cookies and breakfast.  Nice little touches to make the stay like home.  Terrific hosts who could not do enough for their guests."
44515,515686,2011-09-09,938112,Gerald,"you could not find a better litttle cottage in the pacific grove ca area 
Erika and Blake went totally out of their way to treat us like royality even our little Hudson was treated like a king.
the cookies and breakfast was better than any 5 star resturant not quite served in bed but the next best thing.Hot coffee right to your door.
We will stay there again (we are both in our late 70's) in was a very enjoyalbe and wonderful stay.

"
44515,535613,2011-09-16,735094,Nancy,"We loved our stay at Erica & Blake's charming cottage...clean, comfortable, yummy breakfast...Erica makes wonderful cookies and yummy cakepops (Thanks!).  From the green gates to the garden to the cottage to the breakfasts, we had a lovely stay and would come back anytime we are on the peninsula again.  Thanks again for your hospitality!  

Nancy & Doug"
44515,539626,2011-09-17,880860,Tammy,Blake and Erika were the perfect hosts.  We were only sorry our stay was so brief!  
44515,549903,2011-09-20,228177,Florence,Great little cottage and very comfortable. Nice to have a bit of coffee in the morning and really near the Fishwife and Asimolar beach.  Right next to Pebble Beach entrance.  Would come back in a heartbeat!
44515,558799,2011-09-23,746814,Craig,"We had an amazing three-day stay at Erika and Blake's.  The cottage is beautiful and well-kept, plus we enjoyed having the option to cook for ourselves after all the restaurant food one eats on vacation.  The location is fantastic; I loved that it was just a short walk to the ocean and the beautiful shoreline trail along the Monterey Peninsula.  
Although we didn't get to meet either of our hosts as they had been called out of town at the last minute, they still made our stay a great one, in part by having a wonderful house sitter who welcomed us and provided the excellent fresh-baked cookies we'd read about here.  We would (and will) absolutely recommend Erika and Blake's cottage to anyone looking for a nice getaway in the Monterey area."
44515,567904,2011-09-26,649884,Steven,"Wow!  Spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated, and the cottage was nice too!  OK, just kidding.  The place is incredible.  A five minute walk to the beach, this romantic cottage is extremely comfortable and every detail is perfect.  We started planning our return as soon as we got there.  The breakfasts were delicious, and although we didn't get to meet Erika, Blake is dashing, friendly and ornithologically astute.  "
44515,576654,2011-09-27,934207,Marta,We enjoyed staying at Blakes & Erikas cottage!! The cottage is beautiful and the breakfast which Blake made for us was just delicous! We also loved the welcome cookies!! 
44515,591343,2011-10-03,604941,Edwina,"absolutely perfect experience...Erika and Blake are fabulous hosts and made our week-end carefree, had a car issue and they could not have been more accommodating, left my cell charger and they are mailing it back, we are probably a pain to host! Sweet cottage with a superb breakfast HIGHLY recommend this  cottage my first airbnb experience and it could not have gone better...well maybe the car (Website hidden by Airbnb) bad..."
44515,600474,2011-10-05,71552,Tianna,"Cutest little cottage ever. Ever ever. No wait, scratch that. Cutest property ever. The property (in entirety: front and back yard, main house, cottage) oozes charm out of every crevice. Adorable outdoor sitting area, super comfy enormous bed, close to everything but still in a quiet neighborhood. Erika even worked with my mom to put together a surprise picnic basket for our honeymoon. All in all, yes. You should stay here."
44515,605198,2011-10-06,1224029,Liesbeth,"We had a short but lovely stay at the beautiful cottage of Erika & Blake. The decor is amazing and the bed was so soft and comfy. We also appreciated the privacy being able to come and go via a seperate entrance. Great place, we highly recommend it."
44515,615866,2011-10-10,1210741,Trudi,"Sublime!!! Everything was amazing!!! Can't wait to go back....Cheers, Trudi"
44515,621875,2011-10-11,264657,Ranjit,It's a wonderful space with wonderful hosts.  It's actually quite romantic and charming.  And Erika provided a fantastic breakfast as well.
44515,631276,2011-10-16,985813,Lisa,Erika and Blake's place was the perfect getaway.  Their cottage was lovely - beautifully decorated - and had all of the comforts of home.  We especially enjoyed the cookies on arrival and the delicious breakfast we ate outside in the sunshine each morning.  They kept in touch with us before we arrived and communicated everything that we needed to know.  I highly recommend Erika and Blake as hosts and would gladly stay at their place again!
44515,635851,2011-10-17,954458,Deborah,"We felt enfolded in care from the moment we got out of the car- before  that, in fact, since they gave us such specific details about finding the place, parking, etc. The cottage is the kind of space that you feel at home in, as you walk in the door. Comfy chairs, complete kitchen, welcoming patio, nice big bathroom with a great shower and a big, comfortable bed. Erika (I presume) is a wonderful cook. Her scrambled herb eggs are just right, and don't get me started on her home baked bread and cookies- especially her cookies, which I gather are locally famous, as well they should be. It's a short walk to the beach, and a short drive into downtown Pacific Grove, and that ought to do you for however long you're there. Good people. Good, thoughtful care. Check it out. "
44515,649608,2011-10-21,185359,Meryl,"Comfort. Warmth and congeniality. Prepare yourself to be well taken care of. Erika and Blake have done everything right at their beautiful guest house. From the charm and supreme functionality of the guest house, to the superb location, everything was beyond our expectations. And, being seasoned travelers, that is the highest compliment we could give. Their original reviews of eateries that only the locals know about are spot on. Erika and Blake want nothing more than to ensure that your stay is good, that you are comfortable and happy. And, did I mention that our dogs were welcomed, too? You betcha. They loved the cottage and the long walks on the beach (it's dog-on-leash friendly). "
44515,655142,2011-10-23,1165791,Andria,"Very cute place, beautiful area, delicious breakfast, and great restaurant recommendations! Couldn't ask for anything more. "
44515,658467,2011-10-24,1093815,Julie,Erika and Blake really take pride in accommodating their guests. Erika arranged an organic vegan breakfast which was the tastiest tofu scramble I've ever eaten! The place is so beautiful and comfortable. I really can't say anything bad about this airbnb. I was so sad to leave. I will definitely be back!!!
44515,668804,2011-10-27,77565,Tanya,"We loved every minute of our stay at Erika and Blake's! What a charming little place they have created. Every detail was perfect and we can hardly wait to come back.  Thank you!

Tanya, Anna, and Dustin Norkus"
44515,671632,2011-10-28,1227917,Jackie,"Our stay at Erika and Blake's cottage in Pacific Grove was absolutely perfect. The space itself is charming, clean, and private (including your own outdoor patio space!) and Erika and Blake are great hosts. Breakfast is included with a night's stay. It was made fresh for us and absolutely delicious. Erika and Blake's recommendations for dinner in Pacific Grove were also incredibly helpful. Not to mention, the cottage is a quick drive to downtown Monterey. All in all a great experience!"
44515,676854,2011-10-30,1326735,Maria,"This was our first experience with airbnb and we loved it! We have recommended this cottage to our friends. It has a great loctaion, was like being in a Pottery Barn magazine. Erika could not have been sweeter, she made us great breakfasts and gave us restaurant ideas! We walked 2.5 blocks to Asilomar Beach ... can't wait to return!!!"
44515,678247,2011-11-01,1016642,Michael,"This place is just like how it looks in the pictures. The breakfast was delicious and the hosting was delightful. Location-wise, it's about 5-10 minutes by car from main strip in Monterey, which is really convenient. There are several little bistros and restaurants that are even closer in the Pacific Grove area. My wife and I especially liked the fact that they were pet-friendly let our dog roam around in their backyard. I would definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a bit of privacy, while being close enough to hubbub around town. "
44515,686451,2011-11-02,1169436,Dennis & Kay,"Thanks Erica and Blake for letting us stay in your lovely stained glass window cottage!  The location is superb because it’s in the heart of one of Pacific Grove’s most beautiful residential areas and just a short 10 minute walk to the gorgeous blue Pacific Ocean.  We liked starting out each morning devouring your delicious home cooked breakfast, homemade bread, fresh local fruit, the best tasting Audubon-approved French Roast Coffee, and Erica’s chocolate chip Cookies are hands down the BEST!!!  We also loved the big King size bed: very comfortable, lots of pillows warm and cozy, we both slept like logs.  Most of all, we loved staying in a private residential area, instead of a hotel or cluster of cottages.  Please give Morty and Maude a pat on their heads:)"
44515,698751,2011-11-07,1269758,Alex,"Had an absolutely wonderful stay here.  Would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a place to stay in the Monterey Peninsula.  Erika and Blake were extremely courteous and professional.  Cottage is set back on the property, you have an essentially private entrance, overall felt like we had our own house in Pacific Grove for the three days we were there.  The cottage has everything you need for a very comfortable stay.  Bed was incredibly comfortable, small but well appointed kitchen with everything you need, and there was a sitting area outside the door of the cottage.  Breakfast, including coffee, was prepared fresh for us every morning to our specifications and brought out to us.  The ingredients were fresh, presentation was lovely and it was a delight every morning and to top it off delicious chocolate chip cookies appeared by the time we got in in the evenings.  Neighborhood is lovely and quiet, with deer wandering around the streets in the evening, and all this literally 1 minutes drive to the Asilomar Beech and 3 minutes to the restaurants of pacific grove or  5 minutes from Monterey.  I can't praise this place enough.  Do yourself a favor and say here."
44515,704835,2011-11-08,1371239,Priska,We had a very relaxing time in the cute garden cottage! It was beautifully decorated and had a nice beach feel to it. Erika & Blake were excellent hosts and their breakfast was a real treat! We hope we can come back another time!
44515,716264,2011-11-14,1225765,Rob,"We had a fantastic time! The cottage is the perfect weekend getaway spot - clean, charming, and private. Erika and Blake dropped off a wonderful homemade breakfast each morning which was the icing on the cake. Highly recommended."
44515,736928,2011-11-22,1126673,Sonia,"Beautiful, cozy cottage.  Great location near the beach.  Erika and Blake were very accommodating and made us and our dog feel right at home."
44515,740875,2011-11-23,778187,Jacquie,"We enjoyed our stay in the cottage and look forward to coming back again.  The location is very convenient to the aquarium, 17 mile drive and all the shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove.  Erika and Blake are very nice hosts, the bed is very comfortable and breakfast is very good..."
44515,751004,2011-11-28,858766,Ryan,"My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at Erika and Blake's cottage.  The unit has everything you will need, is in a fantastic location and they are really great hosts.  While I went and golfed in the morning, they made my girlfriend breakfast and were generally very accommodating, even giving us the recipe for the delicious chocolate chip cookies that greeted us when we arrived :)  I have already recommended to a few people and I would stay here again without a doubt."
44515,759275,2011-12-02,627442,Nicole,"Adorable space and decor, incredibly gracious hosts, uber-comfy bed, and dog-friendly. AND, you get breakfast! Erika made me rockstar eggs; yum! I hadn't really understood the exact location when we booked, and we were excited to take a little detour on the way out of town on the ever-lovely 17-mile Drive. We only had one quick night, but it was a delight, and we hope to be able to stay with Erika & Blake again!"
44515,764759,2011-12-05,1398997,Alex,"We had a really pleasant stay there.  The cottage is quaint, simple, clean, has a nice big bed, TV, and kitchenette.   Erika and Blake were both very nice, and easy going.  The breakfast is good, and the cookies are REALLY good.  And last but not least, they have the cutest, friendliest little dog.  I understand they have another, bigger dog, which is shy, and whom we didn't get to meet.  The cottage is a couple of blocks from the beach, which is gorgeous, and a short, easy drive into Monterey."
44515,775185,2011-12-10,1451105,Meg,"My husband Wally and I chose Erika and Blake's cottage for our first Air Bnb stay and our first time on the Monterey Penninsula. It was a great get-away: private with quality linens, comfy chairs and gallery-worthy photos of the area and resident bird-life. On a closer look, we discovered that Blake was the photographer. As birders and nature-lovers, this was a treat! 

Erika's ample and fresh breakfasts kick-started our day and cookies  tided us over till dinner. We enjoyed several of the Monterey and Pacific Grove restaurants that Erika and Blake had recommended in the cottage information packet. We drove to Pacific Grove's historic downtown on our last night. What a breath of fresh air to have many local restaurants to choose from and not a chain in sight. Plus the sidewalks were peaceful and not filled with tourists.  

We will definitely come back to enjoy more of the cottage and garden and to explore some more. "
44515,779144,2011-12-12,199820,Suzie,"Erika and Blake's cottage is a visual, sensual delight!  Yummy cookies, breakfast (kept me full during the morning), plus all the loving details in the cottage, yard and Erika's personality (we did not get to meet Blake).  The location cannot be beat, especially if you love the beach and Asilomar!  We will return and tell our friends!"
44515,785289,2011-12-14,1439227,Sarah,We loved our stay at Erika & Blake's!  This was the perfect homebase for exploring this gorgeous area of coastline.  Everything was lovely.  A great find.
44515,791702,2011-12-18,504661,Rush,"Erika & Blake were the best hosts giving us all the top spots and places to see. Their immaculate cottage had everything we needed and more. walking distance to beach. Hope to be back in the most serene setting in their beautiful home. To top it off, we had the best chocolate chip cookies and scrambled eggs ever. Thank you for the amazing experience.  "
44515,797696,2011-12-21,1342764,Corrie,"We visited Erika and Blake's cottage for our first wedding anniversary. We had a WONDERFUL stay! Not only is their cottage in an awesome location close to the beach and lots of fun in Monterey, but the cottage itself is LOVELY. We thoroughly enjoyed delicious breakfast every morning, took afternoon naps in the cozy bed every day, and loved all the little details like awesome chocolate chip cookies every night. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this cottage to anyone!"
44515,802431,2011-12-23,1493833,John,"My wife, Allie, my five year old, Bodhi, and I were welcomed with open arms and fresh chocolate chip cookies upon our arrival at Erika and Blake's cottage.  It was a five star experience, from the smile on Erika's face to the tasty scrambled eggs breakfast to the cleanliness and charm of room and grounds.  The neighborhood and sights just put even more emphasis on our satisfying experience.  And, yes we will be back!"
44515,816648,2011-12-31,929140,Sydni,"My husband and I are frequent visitors to the Monterey Peninsula and have stayed at many of the hotels in the area.This was our first time renting a cottage like this AND our first time staying in PG. We LOVED it! All of the other reviews certainly reflect our sentiments. Erika and Blake are fabulous hosts! Completely helpful and available while still giving you the space and privacy you came for. The space is clean and perfectly represented in the photos. (Don't you hate when you get to a place and the photos are completely different from what you see with your own two eyes??) The breakfast each day was delicious and the little kitchen perfectly convenient. It's easy to bring in your own snacks and groceries if you like, as there are 3 grocery stores within a 5 minute drive.  You are also less than 5 minutes from a gorgeous beach, which we enjoyed relaxing at each day. I don't have enough good things to say about this spot. We will definitely be back and eagerly look forward to our next visit! :)"
44515,822292,2012-01-02,88533,Dominique,"Truly wonderful stay! Blake and Erika were really flexible with our late arrival after work and the setting of this cottage is remarkable - short walk to a beautiful beach / path, adorable cottage. Also very thoughtful touches like cookies in the afternoon and custom breakfasts in the morning. Hope to stay here again soon!"
44515,843967,2012-01-06,1506128,Tom,"What a charming, lovely cottage.  Great hosts, delicious breakfast, lots of nice touches. The location is wonderful. We would love to stay there again."
44515,853482,2012-01-09,1559380,Erin,"I am so glad we decided to book Erika and Blake's cottage for our weekend getaway! They were the perfect hosts even before we booked. Their recommendations for activities and restaurants were spot on and made our weekend truly special. And our golden retriever, Riley, couldn't have been happier with their huge, gorgeous garden which they allowed her to explore. The breakfasts and cookies delivered to the cottage were absolutely delicious - the perfect way to start and end each wonderful day. "
44515,860294,2012-01-13,1559270,Jodie & Dan,Erika and Blake were the ultimate hosts! They made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived at their beautiful cottage. Waking up each morning to a delicious homemade breakfast and enjoying their amazing chocolate chip cookies each afternoon made our stay very special. Sunsets at Asilomar Beach were breathtaking and just a short walk from the cottage. We can't wait to visit again!
44515,873174,2012-01-20,1513261,Diane,"What a wonderful place in beautiful Pacific Grove with Erika & Blake. The accommodation more than met our expectation and we could not have hoped for better. The comfort of the bed, the charm of the studio, and the excellent breakfast each day was a perfect, but better yet the location was fantastic. I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone going into the Pacfic Grove. Sweet and charming"
44515,878056,2012-01-23,1272299,Gaye,We had a wonderful time at the cottage even though the weather was stormy in the Pacific Grove area. Erika (and her doggies) gave us a warm welcome and she was the perfect hostess from the beginning to the end of our stay! You could see that Erika and Blake carefully created a beautiful yet simple home-away-from-home for their vistors. We will certainly return! 
44515,882854,2012-01-25,1580175,Katherine,"Lovely place, we were very happy there.  Good food (cookies to greet us!) and a lovely outside seating area next to our building.  Cheery dogs.  Erika v helpful with restaurant recommendations (Passionfish amazing).  Pretty yard, and comfy bed.  And only a 5 min walk to the stunning rocky seaside- just totally beautiful."
44515,887373,2012-01-28,1610821,Peter,"The place was even nicer than I had expected.  Surprisingly spacious, well equipped, quiet and a perfect location for strolls to the seashore or a quick drive to the aquarium.  I loved the casual way the hosts handled the whole transaction"
44515,890138,2012-01-30,388693,Pauline,"Erika and Blake's beach cottage was beautiful! It was really cozy and very, very comfortable. Because we are in their backyard, there was also a lot of privacy and we didn't have to worry about disturbing the family when we were in and out of the house all day. Erika was super sweet. She was extremely accommodating and always had cookies waiting for us when we got home. The breakfast? Phenomenal! I've been craving it since I returned from my trip. I highly recommend their little home and would definitely be heading back some time in the future :) Also, they are located really close to everything - restaurants, Monterey Bay Aquarium and Pebble beach!"
44515,917554,2012-02-13,654652,Alicia,"What a way to kick off our first AirBnB experience!  We have never felt so comfortable and relaxed away from home.  The cottage exceeded our expectations with the level of comfort and coziness it brought to our stay.  It's is in a perfect location in Pacific Grove and just minutes away from all the attractions in Monterey.  Upon arrival, Erika greeted us with delicious cookies that were brought to us daily.  Also, she prepares breakfast offering two healthy options to choose from and coffee (or tea).  We tried both bfast options and enjoyed them both.  The homemade bread was yummy!  We highly recommend this charming cottage with such amazing hosts and are looking forward to returning!  "
44515,922160,2012-02-14,1715291,Nick,"My wife and I had an amazing time at Erica & Blake's beautiful cottage!  The place was in a great location, and we will definitely be returning.  "
44515,923918,2012-02-15,1171851,Regan,"This is a really gorgeous space with cozy accommodations. My boyfriend and I were traveling with two children, ages 1 & 3, and Erika and Blake were surprisingly cool with it. 3 of us slept in the comfy king size bed (which was quite a treat), and we brought a portable crib for the baby. For one night, it was doable, but their place is so nice (and white), that I really had to be on my toes to stop the kids from touching everything, to keep it that way. For my own benefit, I probably wouldn't do it again with both kids, or only for one night.  But, I think it's perfect for 2 people or 2 people with 1 small child. Unfortunately the weather didn't allow us to take advantage of the awesome patio area upon arrival, but the sun came out the following morning and we got to play outside a little before heading down to the beach. The beach is just a skip away from the cottage and is absolutely breathtaking! I love this cottage, and the location, and hope to visit Erika & Blake's casa again in the future. I almost forgot...great toiletries, delicious homemade cookies and  classy breakfast were icing on the cake!"
44515,927113,2012-02-17,1115069,Tom,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place was amazing. A charming, clean, comfortable and fun little guest house a few blocks from the ocean and close to downtown Pacific Grove where there some very nice restaurants for dinner. It's also a short drive down to Big Sur for excellent hiking. A perfect spot for our trip.

Erika was a tremendously gracious, friendly and accommodating host. She gave us great recommendations for places in the area, made coordinating our stay very easy and was just fun to chat with. 

I'd have absolutely no reservations recommending this place to anyone."
44515,931044,2012-02-19,1681572,Pablo,"A bit reluctant to use this system originally. However, I have to say that our stay (Lola my chihuahua and I) was very pleasant. The accommodations were very neat and clean. The cottage had all that you would need for a comfortable stay. Both Erica and Blake were friendly. We were able to share some personal stories without an invasion of privacy that made my stay extra special. I will certainly use the cottage again when I return to Pacific Grove. I would have no reservations about recommending the cottage to anyone. Thanks for the hospitality and making a very sensitive trip so special."
44515,936672,2012-02-21,1574879,Mai,"My fiance and I recently spent 2 nights here with our min pin.  Erika was a very warm and inviting host.  The cottage was clean, cozy and private with a short distance to the ocean.  At night you can actually hear the waves.  We sincerely enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. "
44515,951841,2012-02-27,792307,Oggie,Cant really say anything different than what has already been written. The breakfast is the perfect icing on the cake. Fantastic place.
44515,1007140,2012-03-17,1768425,Bryan,We just visited this beautiful beach cottage and we had a great time. This is in a great location 2 min walk to the beach. Erika and Blake were very good hosts. The breakfast was great and the organic all natural soap and shampoo were a nice touch. The cottage was very clean and it has a very charming landscape surrounding it. 
44515,1011986,2012-03-18,752835,Dani,"We spent 2 beautiful nights in Erika´s and Blake´s cute little cottage - this is a vintage / shabby chic lover´s dream come true! Everything was perfect, the location, the hosts, the cottage itself - we loved all the small details and Erika´s breakfast and the cookies (OMG the cookies!!) are to die for! We will definitely try to be back next time we visit beautiful California!"
44515,1067076,2012-04-01,1425763,Colette,"I pine for this little cottage already!  I had a very relaxing stay, and recommend it most highly.  Erika and Blake are charming, made sure that I had recommendations for everything I needed.  And the breakfast is such a  lovely touch!  The cookies ... can we talk about the cookies?  Sinfully delicious, and when I happened to be there and they were fresh out of the over, heaven on earth.  I really enjoyed exploring this part of California, too, and will be back to this cottage as soon as I am able!"
44515,1097876,2012-04-08,787872,Franz,"My husband, myself and our 4 fur babies had a wonderful stay with Erika and Blake.  Our small family fit perfect and we will definitely stay again.  The cookies were a great welcome and the breakfast was just as amazing. Thank you Erika and Blake for the warm hospitatly.  "
44515,1100500,2012-04-09,1137002,Vivek,"We had a fantastic stay in Pacific Grove thanks to Erika and Blake's hospitality. They were accommodating, friendly, and flexible. The room was spotless and comfortable, and we fit in it with our two-year-old very nicely. The surrounding private garden was a beautiful spot to have the freshly prepared organic breakfast they provided. And the list of local tips was immensely helpful.

Two notes: one for tall folks (over six feet), who might have to stoop/crouch a bit to get under the shower head; and one for bed connoisseurs, who should be aware that the large bed is actually two beds pushed together. However, this didn't bother us at all as the bedding pretty much covered it up - we had a fantastic sleep."
44515,1109759,2012-04-11,6043,Thaisa And Jason,"Erika and Blake have set the gold standard. Watch out, Barefoot Contessa."
44515,1127099,2012-04-14,1609417,Nicola,"We very much fell in love with Erika's and Blake's Beach cottage. It's fairly small (we stayed with our baby and had loads of luggage), but very convenient and tastefully decorated. We only stayed for three nights, but would have liked to stay longer.
The garden around the cottage and the whole area are very beautiful and scenic. We walked to the beach and some restaurants nearby.
We also loved the delicious breakfast Blake served to us."
44515,1136068,2012-04-16,1021951,Karen,"This is such a treasure, I hesitate to share!  Erika and Blake have not missed a beat in their charming cottage near the beach.  Yes - first of all, the location is ideal.  Close to the ocean (5 min. walk) which was vital for travelers with 2 dogs.  Second, the accommodations were top notch. From the minute we walked in, we felt like we were in a Cape Cod setting - complete with the most delectable cookies I've ever tasted.  The cottage has everything you might need, including Wifi, a refrigerator and small kitchen for food prep if you choose to stay in.  I had forgotten, however, that breakfast is served to your door - with organic choices and incredible coffee.  The courtyard was secured for the dogs to roam so we didn't have to rally too early before heading out to the beach.  Erika and Blake were most accommodating...great communicators from the start...and always able to assist with directions or recommendations, et. al.  We loved walking thru the neighborhood for lunch or renting bikes to explore Carmel for the day. I will recommend this to everyone I can, with the caveat that we get priority booking;-)  "
44515,1167044,2012-04-23,1755504,Don,"We stayed a week (without a pet, from April 15th to the 22nd)) at ""Pet-Friendly Asilomar Beach Cottage,"" and could not have been happier. Erika and Blake were perfect hosts, attending promptly to our every need, but also giving us plenty of opportunity to enjoy the quiet and solitude of their wonderful residential property. 

Our stay was usually quiet enough so that we could hear the nearby surf and the wind in the cyprus and pine trees.

We love this neighborhood and have been coming here most years and staying in a nearby motel for more than a decade. (We had our honeymoon in Carmel 47 years ago and have tried to get back at least once a year ever since). Erika and Blake's cottage is much better than the nearby motel ... quieter and better food (excellent breakfast and the occasional treat of chocolate chip cookies when we returned to the cottage after a day of biking).

We enthusiastically recommend Blake and Erika's ""Asilomar Pet-Friendly Beach Cottage"" to any and all, and hope to return here frequently ourselves.
"
44515,1188065,2012-04-27,1921602,Kurt,Such a charming and relaxing space! We loved it!! And the breakfast was amazing...great eggs and bread.  This place is a gem!
44515,1195323,2012-04-29,1670386,Mikaila,"My husband and I were on our honeymoon and we had the most wonderful time at the Beach Cottage. It was equipped with everything for a self-sufficient stay. It was immaculate and bright, even better than the pictures portrayed. The bed was SO comfortable! Erika was the sweetest host, very accommodating and helpful, and the breakfast in the morning in the courtyard was so lovely. And the cookies she left for us every afternoon were the icing on the cake:) I will definitely be recommending this place to all my family and friends. We will be back!"
44515,1221025,2012-05-03,1834414,Michael,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a homerun. We can only hope that our future airbnb experiences are as poitive as this one. 

We agree with the preivous reviews, the cottage is cozy and quaint and Erika and Blake were wonderful hosts. The cottage was more than we expected, very relaxing, private and central to everything we needed. 

The best way to evaluate an experience is ""would you do it again?"" and to that the answer is definitely a yes. We enjoyed everything and hope to return on our next trip to the area."
44515,1248919,2012-05-08,2162053,Leanna,"This was my second Airbnb experience and it was great. Not only is Erika and Blake’s place amazing but they were very understanding and accommodating hosts. It took my bf and I much longer to drive up the coast then we had planned and we got in pretty late. Blake was up to meet us and there were delicious cookies waiting for us in the cottage. In addition, Erika got up super early to make us a wonderful breakfast before we had to get back on the road.

The only thing I would change would be staying longer!!! One short night made us sad that we had to leave. Also, not only is the place super cute but it was immaculate. I wholeheartedly recommend Erika and Blake’s lovely beach cottage—and thank them for such a nice albeit short stay!
"
44515,1265369,2012-05-12,1728727,Steven,"My wife, myself, and our 1-year old daughter had a great stay at Erika and Blake's guest cottage on May 9th and 10th.  The setting was fantastic and Erika and Blake were fantastic hosts.  This was the end of our 8-day trip to California in which we had great weather every day from Mendocino to Pacific Grove, not a drop of rain!!  The cottage was wonderful, from the king bed (which was plenty of room for the three of us) to the kitchenette (well stocked with anything you may need to cook if you so desire) to the beautiful courtyard and landscaping.  Fresh cooked breakfast is included in the rate and should not be missed (fresh homemade cookies were also a nice bonus for the sweet tooth). The main house/cottage are in a nice quiet neighborhood only a short walk down the road from the ocean.  Pacific Grove is a nice quaint town to tour for a couple of days and Monterey is literally only minutes from the cottage. Pacific Grove and Monterey really just seemed like one town/city.  The aquarium is a must see and our hosts were very kind to share their membership cards with us for a free visit!  Our 1-year old had a great time with all the fishes.  All in all, the cottage is a wonderful retreat for couples looking for a romantic getaway in a pristine natural setting.  

Steven Jennifer and Miss Brie "
44515,1284380,2012-05-15,1457928,Susanna,"we had a lovely stay in Erika and Blake's lovely cottage by the sea!    Great hosts, sweet little cottage and lovely wildlife all around their picturesque garden  The Monterey aquarium was a great visit and unexpected.   We are sorry we only managed a 3 day break, we'll be back!"
44515,1289684,2012-05-16,2024370,Bahia,"This cottage is perfect and so cute.  Staying here was like staying at a Bed and Breakfast.  The whole place was charming, with a beautiful courtyard outside.  Blake was a great host.  He saw that we got settled and then we were able to come and go as we pleased.  I'd definitely recommend staying here.  It's close to Monterey, but far enough that it isn't touristy and has it's own charms.  There are restaurants in the area, and a short walk to the lovely coast."
44515,1298667,2012-05-18,1755794,Jonathan,"We almost don't want to write this for fear that the place will never be free again.  In a word, Erika and Blake's place was perfect.  The cottage itself is adorable, the grounds beautiful, the location ideal, and well...next time we are staying much longer (if available). Much more of a B&B feel than our other two airbnb stops during our CA vacation.  One really didn't need to bring anything.  We arrived later than expected but Blake was there upon our arrival in good spirits nevertheless.  He also delivered breakfast to our room each morning.  Oh, and the bed was super comfy.  Already looking forward to our next stay."
44515,1325477,2012-05-22,1680875,Kris,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and what a wonderful introduction to the program.  Blake and Erika's cottage was the perfect getaway for my husband and I for our anniversary.  The photos shown are a true representation of the cottage, but it's impossible to capture the peacefulness and privacy of the cottage. We stayed 4 days and just soaked up the beach, local dining (Passionfish was AMAZING) and the passes to the Aquarium were a bonus!  It's hard not to echo all the previous great reviews, but that's a testament to E & B's wonderful attention to detail (yummy eggs, and to-die-for cookies!) and being amazingly gracious hosts.  Sidenote - bring your binoculars - the walk to the beach is 5 minutes and a haven for sea lions and otters!  We'll definitley be back someday!"
44515,1360362,2012-05-28,1377956,Theresa,"My husband & I were warmly welcomed by Erika when we arrived for our 3 day stay. It couldn't have been better. Each day we were treated to a fresh, tasty breakfast that Erika so lovingly made. The cottage was clean and had everything we needed to make our stay extremely enjoyable. I would recommend this special place to anyone traveling in Pacific Grove, CA area. Lovely indeed!"
44515,1388728,2012-05-31,2112427,Jayson,"My husband chose this setting to begin my birthday getaway celebration...he knows me so well. 

This home has the feeling of an enchanting English cottage.  It is nestled behind wooden gates set along meandering paths lined with floral and fauna.  The guest cottage is tucked in the back patio with park like settings.

Once you swing open the door, you will fall in love.  The cottage is so well appointed with a classic blue and white nautical theme.  Think quintessential New England/Cape Cod cottage...

Erika and Blake have thought of EVERYTHING: the bed was ridiculously comfy that nothing will measure up again!; fresh flowers in well placed bud vases, fully stocked kitchenette for use, a beautiful breakfast  (you get to select your own out of two options) served either in the cottage or outside on the lovely little patio (weather permitting), the most amazing chocolate chunk cookies and passes to the Monterey Aquarium should you wish to venture out!  Really, what more could you ask for?!!

In addition to all the wonderful details is its location...a short walk to the beach will find you climbing rocks, walking paths or simply sitting  and enjoying the naturally beautiful view.

We only stayed one night at this lovely little cottage but it warmed my heart and Erika was a delight...if we lived closer, I'd love to be able to call her a friend :)

Stay here, you won't be disappointed!"
44515,1409771,2012-06-04,2000550,Diana,"This is a great place to stay in Pacific Grove!   Wonderful king bed, pleasant decorations,room to sit and ample kitchenette, lovely garden and outside area, walking distance to Asilomar beach and driving distance to many beautiful places.  And the breakfast was perfect - healthy and tasty!  Definitely recommend to those who want to stay in the area."
44515,1479740,2012-06-14,1110368,Jonathan,"As someone who tends to have high standards regarding my accommodations, I was very satisfied with my stay at the Beach Cottage. The cottage was tastefully furnished and decorated, such that I wondered whether the hosts had a background in interior design or the arts. It felt comfortable and spacious for two people. We stayed only for two nights, but we would have enjoyed a longer stay. Part of what contributed to the feeling of roominess was the large, furnished courtyard.

The neighborhood is excellent. It abuts the scenic Asilomar beaches and a long beach trail.  It also includes many quiet streets lined with exotic trees, bushes and flowers -- great for walking. About a block away, there also is a walking and cycling trail through the neighborhood.

Erika and Blake were friendly and helpful. We arrived much later than expected due to traffic between the airport and the cottage. However, Blake, who was home at the time, was quite understanding. The breakfasts we received were tasty and healthy, and they allowed us to start our day in a leisurely fashion.

In sum, the Beach Cottage is a very good value for the price. It is one of those rare vacation gems that I am glad to have discovered."
44515,1503702,2012-06-18,35264,Lauren,We're long time airbnb fans and this was one of our best experiences ever! Erika was such a sweet heart and such a great hostess. The breakfast in the morning was absolutely delicious. 
44515,1553434,2012-06-25,1763935,Edmund,Quiet garden setting away from the husle and bustle but still close enough to readily get to where the action is. We road a bicycle to see the sites and enjoy the beutiful coast line on offer.
44515,1582015,2012-06-28,2436528,Sara,"My husband and i stayed for two nights with our almost two year old boy. We had an awesome time! The cottage was perfect for our little family. We cooked most of our meals there in the kitchen. It was stocked with the basics, spices, olive oil, etc, which made it so easy. We we centrally located between the golf courses, the beach, and the wharf. We used the aquarium passes both days which our son loved! Erica and Blake were both very nice and hospitable. They were available if you needed something but also gave us space to enjoy our stay. We loved the breakfasts and the yummy cookies! The cottage was clean and nicely decorated. We would definitively recommend to others and would stay there again. "
44515,1586336,2012-06-29,2125326,Aaron,"We stayed for one night and I only wish we had more time here!  We stopped here on our way to San Fran and it was just a few minutes from highway 1.  This cottage and the surrounding grounds look like it's out of a magazine.  Everything about the place is so well done and put together.  The cottage itself is well-decorated and soothing to be in.  High quality linens are used throughout.  There is a small kitchenette that was fully stocked, however, we had no need for it during our short stay.  The bed was unbelievably plush and sucked you right in!  There are also several enjoyable books in the room for your reading pleasure.  Definitely take the 17 mile drive on while your there-you can hop on like 2 minutes from their house and end in beautiful Caramel and grab a bite to eat at one of the great little restaurants.

We felt comfortable, safe, and relaxed while staying here.  Communication and check-in were great.  

FYI, the breakfast was excellent and very well prepared by Erika!  "
44515,1608001,2012-07-02,1840830,Alan,The cottage was amazing. It is very quiet and peaceful and only a few minutes walk to the beach where we saw otters and seals. It was perfect for us as a base to explore the area.
44515,1622378,2012-07-03,1272299,Gaye,"This was our second stay at the cottage and it was as peaceful and quiet as our last stay. Erika is a gracious and welcoming hostess who make us feel SO at home.

The only negative part of our trip: it was too short!"
44515,1633737,2012-07-05,1913314,Mike,"The cottage was so lovely.

It was only two nights in my nine day trip. So I was not expecting much from it initially. But when my fiancee and I got there, Erika was so kind and welcoming, the cottage was private as the description promised, and the room was clean, neat and comfortable.

We were delighted with the welcoming cookies and free tickets to the nearby aquarium - the aquarium was the must-see. 

The location is wonderful too. We booked a golf tee-time at Pacific grove golf links and the cottage is like 5 min driving away from the links. And the famous 17 mile drive is adjacent to the street where the cottage is on. 


If I shall visit Monterey area in the future, this place is where I'm going to stay.

"
44515,1651396,2012-07-07,2709083,Diego,We had a great time in Pacific Grove. Erika & Blake's cottage is gorgeous and the location is amazing - two short blocks from the best portion of Asilomar Beach. We even got a delicious breakfast and fresh baked cookies everyday! I HIGHLY recommend staying here. Erika and Blake were super-friendly.
44515,1689040,2012-07-12,1705141,Erin,"We wish we could give more than five stars! Our stay at Erika and Blake's cottage was one of the highlights of our trip to coastal California. We felt so welcome from the minute we arrived. The small touches to our stay made it all the more special: fresh chocolate chip cookies as a welcome treat, a variety of breakfast offerings, a huge and incredibly soft bed, and maps and books to guide us through the area. Erika and Blake could not have been more accommodating. We can't thank them enough for making our stay so special and for providing us with the best breakfast we had in all of California! We can't wait for our return trip."
44515,1708986,2012-07-15,846694,Patrick,"Erika and Blake were excellent hosts. They provided great recommendations. The guest house was clean, and equipped with everything we needed and more. Breakfast was delicious, and was included with the stay. I would definitely recommend them to anyone planning on staying in the Pacific Grove, Monterey, or Carmel area. "
44515,1716574,2012-07-16,1824926,Emily,"Erika and Blake's guest cottage is the most amazing find on Airbnb!  My husband and I were floored (in a good way!) by their warm hospitality and attention to every detail.  The cottage itself is an adorable home away from home.  They had EVERYTHING thought of before we got there - local restaurant list complete with directions, descriptions and prices, season passes to the wonderful Monterey Bay Aquarium, and a menu for breakfast in the morning!  Erika even helped set up surf lessons for my husband!  Don't pass this one up travelers - it's a 10!!!"
44515,1783213,2012-07-23,2118711,Jennifer,"We love the cottage! Great location for walks to the beach, short stroll to town. Everything was just as described...and better! Looking forward to staying again sometime!"
44515,1793716,2012-07-24,2948874,Teru,"Gold standard. My first AirBnB experience, and I'm afraid it will be all downhill from here. A beautiful, very private cottage, really thoughtfully designed, stunning garden, and an incredible location, just a few minutes walk to a spectacular coast. Erika is a really friendly host, and makes an awesome breakfast. Wish I could have stayed longer. "
44515,1831067,2012-07-29,1577842,John,"We stayed at Asilomar beach cottage for during our honeymoon in California. It was every bit as good as it looked on the photos and better. The cottage was spotless and very tastefully decorated. Everything you could want for your stay is there including a beautiful breakfast delivered by Erica the next morning. Highly recommend a stay here if you can. 
John & Cliona"
44515,1834310,2012-07-30,1897928,Alex,"Perfect little hidden away paradise, with flowers and lots of birds.  A very refreshing and relaxing environment.  The hosts are extremely friendly and eager to help.  Breakfast was delicious and right on time.   Highly recommended and would definitely stay again (I wish we weren't leaving so soon!)"
44515,1866485,2012-08-02,1550983,Simon,"Beautiful cottage set in lovely gardens with an easy walk to the beach. Wild deer down the road in this very quiet area.
Lovely touch with breakfast on a tray in the morning - this included possibly the greatest home made bread ever!!! and the home made cookies reached the same level!
Great place to stay - with very friendly hosts who were really helpful in all communications prior to the visit."
44515,1898053,2012-08-06,540360,Valerie,"I had to go to Monterey for my cousin's wedding, but decided to make a whole weekend out of it. I reserved the cottage originally planning on bringing my dog with me. I didn't end up bringing my dog, but it was nice to have that option if I needed to. When I got to the cottage, I was very impressed with it! The photos do not lie! It really is THAT cute :) I loved that there was a full kitchenette. I brought some food (and champagne!) with me to enjoy over the weekend. The breakfasts were good. Erika is very sweet and easy going. She was happy to chit-chat, but also didn't invade our privacy at all. She was also able to recommend some nice restaurants to check out and other activities to do while we were there. I've already recommended the cottage to my friends and I hope to be able to go back again soon!"
44515,1941736,2012-08-10,2755474,Colin,"We love Monterey, we love our hosts and we absolutely love our stay in this cosy and stunning cottage! Erika is a cheerful and friendly host, making our stay in Monterey such a pleasant one. We loved her recommendations, but we love her breakfast more! Each morning, we were greeted by her punctual delivery of healthy, organic and tasty breakfast! What a great way to start the day! The cottage is clean, with a nice white and blue theme! The cottage is surrounded by beautiful flowers and birds, and according to my girlfriend, it must be Disneyland! We can't wait to visit Monterey and this beautiful cottage again, and if you are visiting Monterey, your decision to stay with Erika and Blake is one you will not regret! :D"
44515,1960256,2012-08-12,1407551,Donna,"Beautiful! Romantic! Nirvana!...does that give you a clue as to the beauty of Erika & Blake's Beach Cottage?! I happened upon their Pacific Grove, CA   rental while looking for a 1 nite romantic escape for myself & my husband (we've had to live on opposite Coasts the past few months). 
After a quick 2 hr. drive (from 100+ temps in central CA!), we stepped out of our car to the sound of crashing waves in the distance, birds chirping & Erika & Blake's gorgeous piece of property in front of us! Ken & I walked thru a beautiful courtyard, complete w/firepit,  to find our piece of Nirvana waiting for us~ 
The dutch door of the old Cottage was open on top, allowing us to see the beautiful interior  awaiting us. It was absolutely lovely, very clean & tidy, complete with stained glass windows,  a smartly decorated navy blue/white/beige decor, beautiful framed photographs throughout, a  galley-style kitchen (stocked w/all the needed appliances, pots,  pans & dishware) as well as a large bathroom w/thick, plush towels & 'green' soaps/shampoos & a lovely 'heart rock' collection on the windowsill. Fragrant, garden-picked roses were on both nightstands. And the bed & pillows? Absolutely Luxurious!
Erika & Blake left for us a great typed ""menu' of local restaurant & sight recommendations sitting on the kitchen counter  (we used a couple of their suggestions, & they did not disappoint!).   We would have loved to stay for Erika's delicious breakfast fare (included in the price), but we wanted to take in some of the sights before heading home.  
In the morning, Ken & I walked around Erika & Blake's beautiful property, complete with Blake's Giant Sequoia Tree in the front yard!  Before leaving, we met Erika -- warm & welcoming w/a smile that would light up a room!  Even though we only spoke for 10 minutes, Ken & I both knew we knew we would be returning to the Beach Cottage for more romantic getaways whenever we have the chance~  
If you're looking for that unique spot for an extended stay or  simply a weekend getaway, you'll know you've found the perfect place @ Erika & Blake's Asilomar Beach Cottage: once you arrive, you'll never want to leave!"
44515,1965661,2012-08-13,1210741,Trudi,Another stay in paradise! We come back whenever we can--everything is always perfect and so relaxing. What a find!! Already planning the next visit!!
44515,2051260,2012-08-21,1467223,Jack,"Erika and Blake are amazing hosts and the cottage is absolutely superb. The accommodations are located on a very quiet street just blocks from the ocean...nice for a quiet walk before heading off to some of the great restaurants in the area.  In our case, we were taking part in all the Monterey Motoring Madness Week and needed some space to wash and prep our BMW M6 for the concours.  Erika graciously provided space and the needed garden hose, etc.  

The cottage itself is elegantly decorated,  very comfortable and has all the appliances needed for extended stay...frig, oven, range, microwave, sink.  Our hosts provided an excellent breakfast each morning at a time we set and to a nice menu.  

We'll definitely be back--we feel as if we've made friends as well as having found a perfect home base for the week of car activities.  We wish we could give them 10 stars!  They are that good. "
44515,2131897,2012-08-29,553201,Tom,"We stayed at the cottage for a week in August. It was simply wonderful.

We loved everything about the cottage,the location, the delightful cottage and its furnishings and, off course, the hosts, Erika and Blake who are a charming, friendly and extremely helpful young couple.

We cannot encourage people enough to stay here.Do yourselves a favour and treat yourself to a stay here.
Pacific Grove has a lot to offer. The Big Sur is a wonderful place to visit and there is Carmel and the 17 Mile Drive with some outstanding golf courses. The Monterey Aquarium is a must visit, and Erika and Blake provide a free pass to use.

There are some good restaurants in the area. We went to two which are recommended by Erika and Blake, and they were both excellent.

There is also an excellent branch of Whole Foods in Monterey and Trader Joe's in Pacific Grove.

We could not have enjoyed our stay more and our only regret is that we had to leave!!!"
44515,2156683,2012-09-01,1354541,Colin,"Best experience I have had on AirBnb so far. Erika went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. She had vegan cookies prepared when we got there, a vegan breakfast menu, and several suggestions for places to eat. The breakfast was awesome and the coffee was some of the best I have ever had. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need, and the ocean is just a short walk away.  Erika seems to truly enjoy doing this. We could not have asked for a better host! We also lost her house key (which we later found and mailed to her) and she was very understanding. Wish we could have stayed more than one night :(. We would love to come back and stay longer. Thank you Erika!"
44515,2189507,2012-09-04,1741357,Lara,"I stayed at Erika and Blake's cottage for 3 nights over Labor Day, with my fiance and 60lb puppy, while we were attending a wedding in Carmel.  The cottage is absolutely charming and we loved having the space to run our puppy about the yard, and they allowed us to leave him in their yard while we attended some of the wedding events which was a HUGE plus since many ""dog-friendly"" hotels don't want you to leave your dog unattended in the hotel room.  Breakfast was delicious and very timely every morning; and Erika and Blake were both very sweet and professional.  Oh, and the bed was an absolute dream with the 4 inch foam mattress topper.  We loved it so much that we've put it on our registry.  Really, we could not have asked for a better experience!  Thanks so much!"
44515,2204769,2012-09-05,2248153,Sarah," From our very first email, up until the end of our stay, Erika was the sweetest, most helpful host. This was our first airbnb stay, and it was lovely. The cottage is private, clean, and adorable. The location is close to anything you may need, or want to do. We utilized the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes (which was a $70 value!), and had a great time there, and in downtown Monterey Bay. The kitchenette had anything you would need. The breakfast was fresh, and yummy. But the bed, oh the bed was the most comfortable, spacious, snugglely bed I've ever slept in. Both my boyfriend and myself slept great, and that never happens. This place was just what we needed, and we would love to stay there again.
"
44515,2222297,2012-09-07,2420741,Lisa & Ben,"We were blown away by our stay at Erika and Blake's cottage - the location is wonderful: walking distance to the beach and short drive to the quaint town of Pacific Grove. The beach trail is perfect for early morning walks and runs and deer watching! The cottage itself is beautiful and the kitchen is fully equipped should you want to cook. As other reviewers have mentioned: the bed is so comfortable it will leave you wishing for rainy days to stay indoors in bed with a good book! Erika and Blake are wonderful hosts, very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts and coffee they serve are superb. We made use of the guide book, restaurant recommendations and aquarium passes which Erika and Blake thoughtfully provided - a very nice touch! Our only regret was that our stay in the cottage wasn't longer. "
44515,2245748,2012-09-10,2465553,Laura,"We had been putting off vacations because of the difficulty in finding Dog friendly accomodations. We were so glad to finally find a place. The house and cottage were beautiful, Quiet, and private. walking distance to the beach. A wonderful dog park close by with several trails.
We had a great time and would like to return."
44515,2318349,2012-09-17,3404253,Christie,"Great place to stay, with amiable hosts.  They made us feel very welcome, but provided privacy.  Many extras added to pleasant experience (i.e. kitchen well equipped; magazines; books; cookies on arrival; etc).
Setting is very lovely and peaceful.
Would definitely stay again."
44515,2358405,2012-09-21,1852167,Stuart,"The cottage is delightful, with everything you need. The garden setting is delightful. The hosts are delightful. You can't ask for more than that. We enjoyed our stay a great deal and the only regret was that we could not stay longer."
44515,2380343,2012-09-23,2834572,Michelle,"Erika & Blake were so helpful, welcoming, and accommodating. They had everything prepared for our arrival. When we arrived, there were two cookies and notes with restaurant recommendations, general advice, and wifi info. The gardens, courtyard, and cottage are SO beautifully decorated and maintained! It was very clean, comfortable, and ready with everything you would need for your stay. We had an amazing dinner at Passionfish and delicious lunch and brunch at The Red House Cafe. To top it all off, you can easily walk to the beach, and deer come right into the town to munch in front yards! I would highly recommend this stay to anyone."
44515,2404740,2012-09-25,1627208,Anne Marie,We've stayed in several b&bs in other countries and this is not so much a b&b but more like a mini-villa. The setting was charming as were our hosts. Would recommend this venue without hesitation to people who enjoy the convenience of a b&b and the privacy of a detached accommodation. Also thanks Erika for the recommendation to have dinner at the Fishwife restaurant! Great choice.
44515,2439139,2012-09-28,3554804,Brian,"Jenny and I loved our stay! Erika and Blake were so friendly and accommodating, we wished we could have stayed a whole week. The cottage was perfect for us, very comfortable and cozy, and the grounds are private and beautiful. Breakfast was delicious, and we had a great Aquarium visit.  We've recommended the cottage to friends, and we look forward to staying there again!"
44515,2461059,2012-10-01,1709536,Chris,"This was the first time we have used AIRBNB, and it was a total success.  We came down from the Bay Area for a special event and the cottage location and being pet friendly made Erika and Blake's cottage just the ticket.  The cottage was clean, quiet, comfortable and well appointed.  Loved the style, colors and artwork.  Breakfast was perfect and charmingly served.  The patio and yard was open and safe for our pet and the host pets friendly too.  I am sure we will be relaxing at the cottage again.  Thank you so much for your hospitality."
44515,2493443,2012-10-03,2728625,Debbie,"We couldn't have had a better experience. We wanted to get away to a quiet, relaxing place and the cottage was perfect. We loved that the cottage was walking distance to the beach, and a short drive to several other great locations, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Erika and Blake were the best hosts and we will definitely be back."
44515,2569564,2012-10-10,1544079,John And Lynne,"This was our first AirBNB experience, and it couldn't have been better.
Erika and Blake looked after everything and our 3-night stay was too short!

The cottage has everything you need, they advised on restaurants, and Pacific Grove is a great base for Monterey and Carmel. We highly recommend this to anyone.
PS Blake's recipe for scrambled eggs is awesome!!!
"
44515,2585917,2012-10-12,579680,Audrey,"This is an amazing little piece of heaven located nearby the beach. Erika was away during our stay, but Blake had left signs to guide us to the cottage. He was a gracious host who made a wonderful breakfast both days we were there. The cottage is super clean, has plenty of freshly washed towels, wifi Internet access and the most amazing duvet/bed sheets one can dream of. I recommend it to anyone who needs to spend time in the region, it is worth the stop!"
44515,2660653,2012-10-20,2193137,Manuel,"The 2 of us just returned from a 7 nights in the causy and quiet cottage of Erika and Blake. Very confortable and and the Hosts very accomodating.
We were on a triip around the world for 7 plus weeks and after 3 major metropolis it felt like we could breath again. 
The location is great ..having  very minor fault I can  say was indeed was perfect. "
44515,2727673,2012-10-27,3203052,Martha,"There is no more beautiful spot along the California coast than the shoreline which comprises Carmel, Monterey and Pacific Grove. Finding a place to stay that matches the beauty of the natural surroundings can be a challenge . . . especially a place that doesn't break the bank. The cottage at Green Gates is one of those places. It is charming, private and so close to beautiful Asilomar Beach. Erika and Blake are the perfect hosts. There when you need them and not when you don't. Erika, so charmingly, brought us a delicious breakfast each morning and freshly baked cookies each evening. The cottage is hidden behind a grand old home at the back of a lovely garden terrace.  It has its own, private little garden  so that you can sit out and enjoy the the outdoors. There were lots of birds. The ocean and the town of Pacific Grove are both within walking distance and we made good use of the 2 passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We also found it very easy and quick to get from the cottage to Carmel. All in all, it was a perfect getaway. Thank you Erika and Blake."
44515,2758237,2012-10-30,1716911,Elizabeth,"This is a wonderful cottage in a great location.   It's private, it's cozy, it's got everything you could possibly need.  Ericka and Blake are gracious and helpful.  The cottage is located within walking distance of Asilomar Beach.  You can drive to the town of Pacific Grove within mins., as well as the town of Carmel.  We have stayed at this cottage twice now and each time we have had a great experience and I'm sure we will return again.
"
44515,2797929,2012-11-04,3238884,Kristina,"This cottage was pure joy! It was beyond our expectations - even cuter than the pictures online.  Erika was exceptionally friendly, her dogs adorable. We are in love with the area - very charming. The details provided for our enjoyment were so nice - homecooked breakfast delicious, the suggestion to the restaurant, Passionfish, was fantastic, and we loved the Monterey Bay Aquarium - thanks for the free passes!"
44515,2809673,2012-11-05,3143044,Vlad,"My wife and I loved staying here! We will absolutely stay here again. :)
"
44515,2837313,2012-11-08,1396198,Janie,"I don't know that I can say enough about Erika and Blake's cottage! We stayed for 3  nights, and wish we could have stayed longer! The cottage is decorated beautifully. Every detail has been thought of. Very charming. It is also very well equipped. There is a small kitchen, but it had just about everything we needed to cook in one evening. The bathroom is plenty big enough and the shower is great. They also provided breakfast, and there were choices! Oh, and did I mention the cookies? There were 2 cookies there on the first day, and I thought that was sweet, but each day they brought us 2 more. And they were so yummy! The location? It's literally a 5 minute walk to the beach. The beach is stunning there and there are awesome walking trails all around it. The neighborhood they live in is super quiet and lovely. You can walk to restaurants easily. Oh, I didn't mention the bed! If you like soft beds, you'll be in heaven. It was amazing. super soft sheets, down comforter, king size and a great mattress topper. Stay here. You will be glad you did. Thanks Erika and Blake!"
44515,2861208,2012-11-12,30088,Cheri + Andrew,"This guest cottage is an Airbnb gem.  Even though it rained on & off most of our stay, we loved the yard with its uneven brick patio and many paths/seating areas.  The location was perfect - just a short walk to Asilomar beach for dog walking, close to 17-mile drive for cycling, and near off-street paths for running through PG & Monterey.  The only time we got in our car was to go out for dinner.  Breakfast was simple but fresh & tasty with fantastic coffee.  The cottage itself is comfortable and functional, just right for two people who are out & about most of the day.  We especially appreciated that Erika & Blake (and their 2 dogs) were so low-key and welcoming to our own dog Sula who is well-behaved but quite large.  It was great to be able to leave her in the cottage during our dogless activities, and to allow her free access to a sunny bed on the patio when we were home.  Having free passes to the aquarium was a great bonus, and the chocolate chip cookies were the ""icing on the cake"" -- we'll be back!  Thanks for a great long weekend."
44515,2893236,2012-11-15,4115181,Chantel,"Great hosts, very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating with our 11 month old daughter who was into everything! It was great to have a little kitchen to prepare dinner on a couple of nights. The walk to the beach is easy."
44515,2925801,2012-11-20,2487483,Joe,We loved the cottage.  Perfect location - you can hear the ocean from the cottage and it's about a 5 min walk down to the beach.  Extremely comfortable bed and a great patio/courtyard area for when the weather's nice.
44515,2939302,2012-11-21,2447159,Nigel,"we were only here very briefly but thought it a great little place in an excellent location.  Blake was a quiet and unassuming host who brought us  a lovely breakfast to start our day. Very good eating nearby, by the way.  recommend The Red House."
44515,2945154,2012-11-23,3253109,Bernadette,"The only problem with staying here is trying to rebook so that you can experience it all over again! While we did not get to meet Blake, Erica was the perfect host, friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive. The cottage has all that you need and is on a par with any boutique hotel, we loved it. All we need to do now is find an open weekend in their booking calendar so that we can get back!"
44515,2978207,2012-11-27,465270,Laurie And Craig,"Erika and Blake are the model airbnb hosts!  Their directions to the Cottage at Green Gates and their instructions about the property were perfect, leaving us with no questions upon arrival and helping us feel immediately at home in the cozy cottage.  From the warm, delicious chocolate chip cookie that we found every day to the healthy breakfast served on the private patio, we totally enjoyed every minute.  
The property is perfectly located one block from the beach, a few blocks from the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary and 3 miles from the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  We didn’t have to travel long distances to see the beauty of the coast and the wildlife that inhabit the area.
Erika and Blake are a friendly, caring couple who think of everything to ensure the comforts of their guests.  We have already started recommending them to our friends and family and hope to stay there again in the future.
"
44515,3030636,2012-12-05,52742,Pamela,"Great location, absolutely adorable guest cottage. Felt like I was on the set of ""It's Complicated"".....very nice and gracious hosts. Highly recommend taking a morning walk/run along the trails that hug along the rocky shoreline. The guest cottage has the most comfortable bed! Loved having breakfast ready for us in the am-and it was Delicious! Will hopefully stay there again when I re-visit the Monterey area. "
44515,3057754,2012-12-11,3819039,Sherry,"Erika, Thanks so much for the fun weekend at your cozy cottage by the beach! Ben was very surprised by his birthday getaway!
You are fun hostess and we totally enjoyed our first experience with AIRBNB! Your cottage was so close to  all the fun spots in Pacific Grove, Monterrey and Carmel! Plus we had such great weather that weekend! I know we will be seeing you again in the future! Sherry"
44515,3110840,2012-12-18,3503191,Gary,"This was our first experience with Airbnb.  We wanted a reasonably priced place to explore Monterey and Carmel and Erika and Blake's cottage in Pacifc Grove was perfect.  We've been to Carmel and Monterey many times but had never spent much time in Pacific Grove.  It's a perfect location within easy drives of both but don't miss exploring Pacific Grove as well with many good restaurants to choose from.  We stayed 6 nights with our shelty, Duchess.  For breakfast each day, Erika accomodated us both with omnivour choices (me) and vegan choices (my wife) personally served by Erika or Blake along with one of their dogs, Morty who came by to meet Duchess  (their other dog, Maude, was too shy to come visit).  Several nights we returned from dinner to find fresh baked cookies waiting for us.  The cottage is cozy and the king size bed was very comfortable with a memory foam mattress topper which made staying 6 nights most enjoyable.  You don't typically find that in a hotel.  The studio cottage has a small kitcehette that was well stocked with most everything we needed and the cottage is within 5 minutes walking to Asilomar State Beach which is a beautiful stretech of coastline.  The trails are well maintained and we were able to walk miles each day right along the coast or through the Asilomar conference center grounds.  The only thing we could not take advantage of because of the weather was the private patio right outside the cottage.  Had it not been damp and cold in mid-December it would have been a great place to enjoy breakfast in the morning and a glass of wine at night.  Thanks to Erika, Blake and Morty for making our stay an enjoyable one.  "

The guest passes for the aquarium were a real treat.  The cottage is right up the way from the beach and very centrally located to all kinds of fun stuff to do.  We only crossed over with Blake and he was very respectful of our space but right there if we found ourselves needing anything.  Stay here you won't be disappointed! 
Cheers,
Christian and Crystal"
44515,3169426,2012-12-28,1170579,Barbara,"Absolutely delightful is an understatement!!!  The location was perfect.  Lovely cozy cottage with wonderful patio.  We delighted in the close proximity to the beach every day... even when it was raining.  What a blessing to find this wonderful abode and owners who embrace organic living.  Erika and Blake...  you made our Christmas!  

Breakfast was always wonderful and we were accommodated the tasty ingredients several mornings so that we could delight in making breakfast at our leisure.   Wonderful cookies in the afternoon... 

Thanks for letting us utilize the grill...  the advice on the fresh seafood place... the Aquarium was a wonderful adventure.  I hope to be back... or host you in Alaska... or perhaps Nicaragua.  :)"
44515,3193471,2012-12-31,2372725,Carolyn,"Ditto what others have said. Erika is the hostess with the mostess - from the chocolate chip cookies, to breakfast, to her warm and friendly presence.  We loved staying here - a great location so close to the beach and within walking distance of a couple of restaurants.  It really was a perfect spot to explore the Monterey area!  Thanks!"
44515,3215929,2013-01-02,88533,Dominique,"My second time at Erika and Blake's place and can't imagine a better experience.  Cozy, adorably decorated cottage. Pet friendly. Cookies every afternoon and breakfast every morning. Super friendly hosts. Lovely location a few min walk from the beach.  Airbnb at it's best!"
44515,3307231,2013-01-08,285150,Clare,"This was my favorite airbnb stay, and one of the best places I have stayed. My boyfriend Will and I stayed with Erika and Blake for four days while visiting Monterey for a wedding. Seeing as I lived in Monterey previously I had in mind a particular area i wanted to stay in, that was private, easy to access, and fun for a couple. This was that place. 
Absolutely loved breakfast and the AMAZING cookies, the cottage itself is very cute and the gardens are beautiful. If it was nicer weather i would have spent hours in the garden. The decor and full kitchen make for a great stay, and, true to other reviews, we could not believe how comfortable the bed was. Erika was an amazing host, so sweet and accommodating, and has the cutest dogs. I will 100% be going back to Erika and Blake's great cottage. "
44515,3350724,2013-01-15,3451410,Andrew And Christy,"We stayed in 4 vacation rentals while on a road trip in various locations and this was by far our favourite. Erika and Blake's property is one of the most beautiful we've seen!  The grounds were so nice and we had our own private courtyard. We got a really nice breakfast provided by our hosts each morning, which really simplified things. The cottage itself was beautifully decorated and very comfortable (they weren't lying about the bed, it was so soft and cozy). We would definitely stay again!"
44515,3403278,2013-01-23,1099417,Nancy,"My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary last week; and we are SO glad we chose Erika and Blakes cottage!   It was absolutely delightful (quaint. warm, cozy. cute)... and the king bed was the best I had ever slept in!!  What beautiful gardens surrounded us; and we had our own private veranda outside the front door!  Erika and Blake are wonderful, warm hosts!   Thanks for a wonderful breakfasts served to us at our requested time each morning, Erika!  We will definitely be back~"
44515,3425524,2013-01-28,4317971,Lauren,"We had such a wonderful time this weekend staying in Blake & Erika's cottage! On Friday we arrived in the evening, and even before we had the chance to pull out our cell phones to give Blake and Erika a call to let them know we had arrived, Blake greeted us and showed us back to the cottage. The place was cute, cozy and clean; we couldn't have asked for a more relaxing place to spend our anniversary weekend. We loved the breakfast that was provided each morning, and aquarium tickets were an added bonus. Blake and Erika were exemplary hosts and we are so happy we had a chance to stay with them! :) "
44515,3446413,2013-01-31,451033,Jennifer,"Blake and Erika have created a cozy, very comfortable studio with everything you need.  It was clean, had a super-comfy big bed, cute compact kitchen and they serve you a delicious breakfast every morning.  Blake's bird photos adorn the walls.  The private outdoor courtyard must be delightful in summer (we visited in January).  They are unintrusive hosts, so this is like staying in a high end private resort with no other guests.  Be sure to eat at Passionfish -- the best restaurant in Pacific Grove.
Jennifer and Fernand"
44515,3459416,2013-02-02,4646428,Ramona,wonderful spot.  private. great neighborhood. close to beach.  nicely decorated.  delicious cookies....french roast coffee! great breakfast tray.  YES...   .very comfortable bed  . thank you Erika &Blake for providing a beautiful haven.
44515,3479255,2013-02-05,3345705,Carol,"I love the location - took all of 4 minutes to walk to the beach. We arrived to a very clean, neat place. Had a little hiccup regarding the heater but once we got beyond that, we enjoyed watching the Super Bowl game and soon headed out to Cannery row for dinner. Breakfast was yummy, though the coffee carafe was on its last leg and leaked coffee into the chair and pillow. (I felt very bad about that .... ) The bed with its topper was a little soft for us, the King-sized pillows not as hug-gable as the standard-sized pillows I'm used to, but all in all it was a wonderful experience which I hope to repeat! Erika and Blake were totally absent (until needed) which was a nice surprise - I wasn't sure what to expect given this was my first experience with AirBnB. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful, serene setting. And the Monterrey Bay Aquarium passes were a definite plus, given the going rate is $34 for adults. A terrific perk not to be missed! 
"
44515,3496704,2013-02-08,1698694,Anne,"We stayed at the Pet-Friendly Asilomar Beach Cottage this past week, and we could not have been more pleased.  We attended the AT&T Pro-Am Golf Tournament and found Erica and Blake' cozy cottage a perfect place to relax after watching a day golf.  Situated near Asilomar Beach, the cottage's location is ideal for dining, exploring or biking around the Monterey area.  A bonus for staying there is a freshly prepared breakfast delivered at your doorstep at the specified time.  The cottage has a small, efficiency kitchen, complete with a gas range, stove, refrigerator, pots/pans, coffee maker, microwave, enough to enjoy a home-prepared meal. This cottage is perfect for a couple who want to have an escape from their hectic life and enjoy a perfectly peaceful respite.

"
44515,3523912,2013-02-12,3514262,Carrisa,"Staying with Erika an Blake is my first encounter with airbnb and I was initially apprehensive about it. However, when I arrived at the place, I have a really good feel about it. The place is nice and cosy. I really liked the privacy and the tea and cookie. Erika and Blake are both very friendly and helpful. "
44515,3550994,2013-02-16,3621469,Loanna,"We received clear communication from Erika regarding our breakfasts and how to find the home/cottage and directions.  We were disappointed not to meet her or Blake.
What a lovely place -- great linens, well appointed, very good use of a small space.  The cottage has it's own private courtyard.
We would encourage them to have a ""house book""  especially if they aren't there to meet their guests.  They did have some local tourist  booklet and a sheet of some restaurants.
It was such a nice quiet neighborhood, however the gardeners were there when we arrived (we needed to close the curtain next to the space they were working), then one of the mornings they were there working and using a blower by 9:00, it was not a great way to wake up. So again we needed to close the curtains, they also were in the private courtyard.
Overall, this is a darling place to stay."
44515,3621312,2013-02-26,1929237,Stacy,"We had a wonderful time! The cottage is in an amazing location, minutes walk to the beach - after our delicious breakfasts we walked down to the coast and along the water for miles. The cottage itself is very quaint, the bed is super comfortable, and we had everything we needed for a great weekend. Would stay here again! And our lab loved it too. Thank you! "
44515,3693740,2013-03-04,4375942,Cecile,"I had a wonderful time in the lovely cottage of Erika and Blake. 
They weren't here when we arrived but signs indicated to us the way to go. 
We had everything needed (oil, salt, pepper, skillet, plates, forks..., towels, soap...) inside, the cottage is amazingly well furnished. We met Erika in the morning, she prepared us a breakfast, served at our convenience. 
Her little partner in crime, a cute dog also welcome us.
We used the free pass for the bay aquarium on the bay and had a blast there.
I can only say positive things, and recommend to everybody to book with Erika and Blake. "
44515,3727014,2013-03-09,4261549,Michelle,"A lovely cottage, and great hosts. 
Nice breakfasts and good information on the local wildlife (thanks Blake!). 
We had all we needed in the cottage. It was very comfortable. 
The location is brilliant, near the aquarium, Fisherman's Wharf (whale watching trips) and the ocean. 
A very enjoyable stay. Thank you both.
"
44515,3813507,2013-03-18,4395572,Elodie,"We really appreciated our stay in this charming cottage, even if we were busy with our conference. The place is very nice and quiet close to the ocean. Erika and Blake are very kindly and prepared great cookies. We would like also to thanks  their assistant (puppy) for the breakfast !  We recommend this beautiful place without hesitation. 

"
44515,3860654,2013-03-22,4853687,Vanessa,"Wonderful hosts, lovely breakfast, yummy cookies and cute dogs! Everything was perfect. Thank you!"
44515,3874773,2013-03-23,994265,Christian,"Erika and Blake's place was awesome.  Just as advertised and even better!  Great location and easy to get to, even after a full day of driving.  The cottage itself was very clean and had everything you might need (clean towels, dishes, microwave, etc.).  The cookies and breakfast were also great!

If you're ever in the area, we'd highly recommend staying at Blake and Erika's.  And if you're not in the area, plan a trip and book a stay at their place!"
44515,3885914,2013-03-25,4168982,Tom,Amazing location + Lovely set up + Great hosts = we will be coming back! 
44515,3926964,2013-03-28,4317183,Dylan & Sarah,"Erika and Blake's lovely cottage made for a perfect stay. Beautiful, quaint and incredibly comfortable. Also perfectly located. A mere stroll to the beach as well as a short drive to some lovely local restaurants. Our hosts were both very friendly and the highlight for us was the great breakfast they brought us which we were able to eat in the sun in the cute private courtyard. Aquarium tickets were also very much appreciated. Would highly recommend staying here  "
44515,3946098,2013-03-30,89125,Madeline,"Heaven! Thank you Erika and Blake for being truly amazing hosts. We arrived after a long drive and felt like we walked into an oasis. We were even more delighted when we opened the cottage door and saw chocolate chip cookies waiting for us! A perfect getaway with everything you could want (full stove, oven, fridge, dishes, microwave, toaster, kettle and more!) and everything was extremely comfortable. We loved meeting Erika and Blake at breakfast (which is, by the way, awesome) as well as Morty and Maude, their sweet dogs. You would be amiss not to stay here if you are in the Monterey area. "
44515,3972380,2013-04-01,1555166,Russell,"No surprise here, another terrific 5-star review Erika and the cottage. They are clearly pros and it shows in every detail. Great instructions and signs, well-equipped kitchen, bathroom and bed room, nice amenities. Great privacy with your own courtyard and an excellent location from which you can walk to the beach in a couple minutes, and downtown or the aquarium in 15 - 30 minutes. And the walks are through cozy and interesting residential neighborhoods and parks. Thanks Erika!"
44515,4041817,2013-04-05,5026619,Michael,"Loved Beach Cottage 2! Erika and Blake go the extra mile to make sure your stay is everything you would expect. The location was perfect, close to every place you would want to visit including the short walk to the beach! The cottage was perfect size for two and a four leg Companion. Small but adequate kitchen, comfortable king size bed and plenty of privacy. The morning breakfast was very good and always delivered to your door with a warm greeting and smile. Erika's cookies are to die for, best ever!!! In short, my wife and I had a wonderful time and enjoyed everything Pacific Grove had to offer. Highly recommend Beach Cottage 2 and it's wonderful hosts!!!!   "
44515,4072017,2013-04-08,4187466,Alex,"A big thanks to Erika and Blake for our wonderful stay in their little piece of paradise in Pacific Grove. They both gave us a lovely warm welcome and couldn't have been more helpful.

The beach cottage is beautiful and tucked away to provide a quite and private location with its own sunny outdoor space. The glorious beach is a few minutes walk away and was one of the nicest stretches of coast line that we visited on our multiple-stop trip from LA to San Fran. 

Oh, and did I mention the wonderful dogs? An amazing stay - thank you!"
44515,4105208,2013-04-10,3851794,Fernanda,"My husband and I stayed on Pet-Friendly Beach Cottage for 3 days and we really enjoyed everything! The sound of ocean waves were amazing all night long, and the privacy of the cottage were really nice too. 
We just loved the welcome cookies and the breakfast with organic yogurt and toasted bread! Were delicious! :) And we had a great and funny time on the aquarium, that we visited with Erika & Blake's tickets.  
Moreover, Pacific Grove is so charming, the beach is gorgeous and it's really near Monterrey, 17 Mile Drive and Carmel. 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
44515,4201832,2013-04-18,3481817,Chris & Carmen,Done a lot of airbnb'ing and this is the best place I have stayed so far.  I am still dreaming about sleeping in that bed again... and the hospitality and location are great.
44515,4504813,2013-05-09,5537606,Katy,WOW.  That's all I can say.  Amazing place and location!  The bed is the most comfy bed I have ever slept on.  EVER.  I want it!  Erika and Blake were very kind to let us stay on an extra night since we loved it so much.  Great breakfast daily! We had lots of privacy and were extremely comfy.  I would live there!!!!  Thanks!
44515,4608376,2013-05-15,4039954,Stuart,"My wife and I had a lovely two-night stay at the beautiful and private Beach Cottage on our honeymoon. Erika and Blake were excellent hosts and made delicious scrambled eggs for breakfast and cookies when we arrived and left. The cottage, nestled among tress and flowers, is five minutes walk to Asilomar beach, a few minutes drive to the entrance of the 17-Mile Drive and 10 minutes to Monterey. A perfect location. Make sure you check out a sunset when you're there - stunning. Hopefully we'll make it back again one day. P.S. Erika, I forgot to say we went to The Penny Ice Creamery in Santa Cruz - it was delicious. Thanks for the tip."
44515,4644270,2013-05-18,585062,Perry,"Erika and Blake were fantastic hosts. The cottage we stayed in for part of our honeymoon was adorable and homey. They provided delicious breakfast every morning, which we always looked forward to. If you are headed to monterey for any reason, stay with Erika and Blake. Our stay was better than that of many hotels. We highly recommend staying with them and we will definitely be staying with them again on future trips to the area. "
44515,4700459,2013-05-21,4691407,Kim,"After having a bad first experience with an airbnb rental a few weeks ago and walking away from it I was considering canceling this.  However, I am very glad I did not.  It is a small but charming little cottage with a great location, less than a 5 minute walk to the ocean which had a great trail system. Plus being centrally located between Monterey and Carmel and vey easy to access the 17 mile drive.   One of the problems I felt with the other airbnb was safety but this cottage has 3 gates you have to go through to get in and was very safe and peaceful.   One of the things I liked was being able to open windows and the door and feel like you were outside as opposed to the typical hotel.  Breakfast was served in the morning at whatever time you requested and very good.  I will for sure come back here when in the area.  "
44515,4745514,2013-05-23,5854609,Jordan,"What an amazing place! Erika and Blake were fantastic hosts, giving us great recommendations for things to see around Pacific Grove while giving us our privacy as well. The breakfast in the morning was great and it was such a pleasure to eat it outside on the patio, with Mortie playing flirt while Maude watched from afar. Freshly baked cookies in the afternoon were a perfect treat as well. The location was fantastic - a three minute walk to the ocean and two miles from downtown Monterey, with a great walk right on the coast. The cottage was so cute and really perfect for our quick getaway. We can't wait to come back, thanks Erika and Blake!"
44515,4810892,2013-05-27,6137777,David,"Our stay was great! The hosts were out of town, but left good instructions on how to find the place and make our way back to the guest cottage. We also had chocolate-chip cookies waiting for us :) The cottage was very clean, very cute and well decorated with plenty of amenities in a small kitchen. Everything we needed was there. There was also great courtyard area in the larger property and a small private outdoor area next to the cottage.  We loved the neighborhood (away from the tourist bustle) and the ability to walk down to the beach with our dogs in five minutes. The free guest passes to the Monterey Aquarium were an added bonus (one of the best we've been to). We wished we could have stayed a week and one day will definitely return and hope to meet the hosts!"
44515,4864152,2013-05-29,6200998,Rosemary,"We only have positive things to say about this charming cottage! Tucked away in a remarkably quaint series of courtyards, you instantly feel like you've stepped back in time or landed in old England. It's the perfect size for two, so comfortable, and equipped with everything you need. Kudos to our hosts, Erika and Blake, for creating such a pleasant get-away. We look forward to returning!"
44515,4916200,2013-06-02,4921701,Kirsten,We loved staying in this quiet little cottage. It is situated in a lovely garden and provides plenty of privacy. Just a few minutes walk to the water. And the aquarium passes are a great benefit! Erika and Blake were helpful and kind and brought us a lovely breakfast each morning right at the requested time. Highly recommend. 
44515,4978025,2013-06-05,4241798,Katherine,"We had a wonderful stay at Erika & Blake's beautiful guest cottage.  The cottage has a super comfortable king-sized bed, seating area, large flat-screen television, kitchenette with gas stove and refrigerator, and lovely private patio.  Erika and Blake left nice shampoos / soaps and plush towels in the bathroom for us.  The cottage was very clean and as nice as any hotel we could have rented.  We felt we had a lot of privacy while we were there.

The location is great as well.  The cottage is a short walk to Asilomar Beach and a healthy walk to downtown Pacific Grove.  It's also a quick drive to downtown Carmel and to Pebble Beach / 17-Mile Drive.  

Erika & Blake were very warm and accommodating hosts and left us directions for easy check-in and check-out.  They left fresh-baked cookies in the room for us and made us a nice breakfast in the morning.  Additionally, we appreciated how welcoming they were to our dog.  

We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the cottage to anyone."
44515,5004538,2013-06-07,2389245,Noah,"Staying in Erika and Blake's cottage was nothing short of spectacular. The cottage was cozy, clean and comfortable and the grounds were beautiful. This was not only the perfect beach cottage by day but a quiet and tranquil retreat at night. Breakfast was delicious and their adorable little doggie who popped in to see us when it was delivered was a welcome treat. The aquarium passes were the icing on the cake and lead us to the quaint town of Monterey where we spent an entire day. Erika was an absolute pleasure and was always available with a smile when we had a question or needed assistance. All in all, a fantastic stay and I would highly recommend this delightful retreat to anyone interested."
44515,5047232,2013-06-10,3553768,Theresa,"Wow what an experience!  Erica and Blake are the best!  They are great hosts, very friendly and easy to get along with.  The cottage is more than we expected, very charming.  The ocean is just down the road where you can take a nice walk along the well-established walking trails.  We hope to go back again."
44515,5101701,2013-06-12,6243159,Robin,"I spent a couple days, with my dog, at Blake & Erika's charming cottage & had a fabulous time. I made my decision to stay there based on the pictures and the incredible reviews and have to agree-I loved staying there. Everything written is true. Next time I'm staying longer!!
"
44515,5141378,2013-06-15,4616117,Kate,"We loved staying at Erika and Blake's cottage, it was absolutely stunning and their hospitality was second to none. The bed was huge and probably the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Their breakfasts were gorgeous and unexpected too; out on the sunny terrace. Their place is a stone's throw away from the coastline with stunning sunsets on the rocks. Thanks for having us and would love to visit again."
44515,5173788,2013-06-17,4886959,Sandi,"The cottage is always so cozy and quiet, the food is yummy always. We are return guests and would readily recommend to all. Blake and Erika are wonderful hosts. "
44515,5290663,2013-06-23,3355080,Joseph A.,"This was a lovely place to stay in Pacific Grove, quiet close walk to a shore, and easy to get around from. The shower head was a little problematic for a tall guy and a bigger bureau for clothes would be helpful , but if a big soft bed is a priority this is definitely the place! "
44515,5327498,2013-06-24,6848218,Jill,"Staying at Erika and Blake's was our first time using airbnb and will be hard to beat!  They have set the bar very very high!! The attention to detail is impeccable, the cottage is the cutest ever and the location is unbeatable!! Not only are the accommodations great,, Erika and the pups are the sweetest ever (I didn't meet Blake). The homemade cookies waiting for us in the room upon our arrival and breakfast in the morning was amaaazing!! I really can't speak highly enough about the Cottage at Green Gates! I'd suggest staying there but I don't want to so that it won't be booked I can stay there as much as possible. :) Just kidding, of course, go!! It's a must."
44515,5391482,2013-06-28,4293291,Beth,"This was my first experience with renting vacation accomodations through Airbnb and it was a stellar one....all I can say is if every Airbnb accomodation is as good as Erika and Blake's Pet Friendly Cottage in Asilomar Beach I will be using Airbnb on all my vacations. Loved the privacy of the back cottage, but homeyness of being in a B&B atmosphere without all the commercialization of a hotel or big chain lodging. Proximity to beach, quaint Pacific Grove was all as promised and the accomodations were true to photographs and descriptions. Excellent experience!"
44515,5445738,2013-07-01,3315866,Bernard,"The cottage was great and had everything you could need. The bed was very comfortable. The location was great and within walking distance of the beach. Erika and Blake were not there on our arrival but signs clearly indicated the route to the cottage.
On a morning breakfast was brought to the cottage by Erika or Blake. This was a nice touch.
It was lovely having breakfast while watching the hummingbirds have theirs.
The local community were very friendly and the are felt very safe."
44515,5507674,2013-07-03,3992734,Matt,Our stay was excellent in all senses. From the minute we arrived we were relaxed and in a state of comfort during our stay. It's the perfect quiet getaway for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Also 2 aquarium passes included which makes any aquarium visits free of charge!
44515,5555647,2013-07-06,5623434,Sarah,"Have you ever wondered what heaven would be like? I have and I can tell you its like this cottage. :) Erika & Blake were incredible from start to finish- I felt great energy from Erika through our online communication and our in person meeting did not disappoint. She and her husband have a delightful space for guests and you feel right at home. The bed is like sleeping on a feather, the chocolate chip cookies are life changing and the short walk to Spanish Bay is icing on the cake. Trader Joe's is nearby- pick up snacks and keep them in the mini-fridge in the cottage. Breakfast on the patio? No problem, Erika hooks it up! You even get to pick a time to eat! Amazing! Looking back on our trip I wish we would have stayed in Pacific Grove longer- its such a beautiful area and Erika & Blake went above and beyond- if you stay here you will want to move in just like we do. Still thinking about the place- miss it much!"
44515,5638689,2013-07-09,6530655,Karon," This is a very charming and very comfortable cottage.  Our Hosts were very pleasant and my cocker spaniel Lily enjoyed exploring the grounds, and with a completely fenced in property I had no worries.

I would recommend this location and plan to use it again, hopefully next time I will not be ill and can enjoy the surrounding areas more."
44515,5709796,2013-07-13,715741,Janet,"Very nice cottage in a nice area.  We arrived at night when the hosts weren't home, and it was a bit difficult to find our way in the dark, but once we saw the signs it was pretty clear.  It is a bit of a tight sqeeze for 3 people, but was definitely doable.  The cottage is very pleasant and private, with everything we needed, and it was great that they served breakfast, which we enjoyed in a lovely private patio!  With the free aquarium tickets what more could you want?"
44515,5746803,2013-07-15,1570079,Daniel,From checking in everything was a smooth process with step by step directions from the front gate. Although we were only staying two nights we managed to check out some of the recommended restaurants including the red house (the Camembert was to die for) also we went whale watching and used the free aquarium passes. The cottage was cosy with everything we could need and we loved the breakfast Erika and Blake provided too. We will definitely have to find an excuse to return again soon. 
44515,5840510,2013-07-19,3982005,Brian,"This was an absolutely great find for me! If you're attending a conference at asilomar, definitely consider staying with Erika and Blake, especially if you have a furry companion in tow. The walk is only about 0.5 miles, and it's along a very quiet street  They are excellent hosts that went above and beyond the call, their home is beautiful and only a couple of blocks from the ocean (where otters and seals abound), and the cottage is an absolute delight to stay in!  They're not joking about the bed either, it's like being hugged by a herd of incredibly friendly geese that are made out of Swedish memory foam.  Breakfasts were delicious, and they were very accommodating of minor dietary needs in that regard.

I really can't recommend this place enough; for the price, it would be incredibly hard to beat in this area, and having a friendly set of hosts (for me at least) really feels a lot nicer when travelling than staying in a hotel."
44515,6019861,2013-07-27,4582480,Linda,"Believe all the positive reviews for this lovely cottage. I thought it looked great in the pictures, but they don't do it justice. Starting with an extremely comfortable king-size bed, the cottage has all the comforts of home. Erika & Blake miss no detail necessary to make your stay both comfortable and memorable. The cottage and patio are very thoughtfully decorated, creating a beautiful and relaxing setting. Their ""light breakfast"" was a real treat. No dry danish or box of corn flakes, but a really nice breakfast. The only drawback is that I didn't want to leave...seriously!

The location is perfect. It's close to the beach and great little restaurants in Pacific Grove (be sure to check out a few on the list provided by Blake & Erika), but just far enough from the touristy parts of Monterey and Carmel. The free tickets to the Monterey Aquarium were really a great bonus. I hope to visit the area again soon. I would never stay anywhere but the Cottage at Green Gates."
44515,6168314,2013-08-02,4204667,Herbert,"We were attending a family reunion in Monterey and wanted to stay somewhere close but away from the tourists.  There is a bus 1/2 block away from the cottage that takes you right to the Aquarium and also other popular locations. You can also walk to the beach which is a couple of blocks away. 

The cottage is perfect for 2 people and well appointed.  It is in the back of the property, very private and is surrounded by beautiful plants and trees.  Erika and Blake serve a wonderful breakfast and are very accommodating with what time you prefer to eat.  The chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon were a special treat. 

Pacific Grove is a charming town with good restaurants and plenty of free parking."
44515,6299451,2013-08-07,6240293,Céline,"We have passed a really good times at Monterey. Everything was good. Thanks to Erika and Blake we have passed a great times. Thank you very much for your hospitality! And the Erika's cookies are the best... :)
See You soon.

44515,6362091,2013-08-10,2266904,Trish,"We had a very pleasant stay at Erika and Blake's. the cottage is adorable and contains everything one could possibly need.  They even had homemade cookies for us when we arrived and left, as well as several breakfast choices each a.m.  Truly above and beyond!  The Aquarium tix were much appreciated as well. We would definitely stay with Erika and Blake again!"
44515,6452979,2013-08-13,4930080,Joan,"We spent 3 nights and we absolutely loved it! The guest house is beautifully decorated, well equipped, private and very peaceful. The hosts are charming and thoughtful. The location is great. We had dinner at the Red House Cafe and the Fishwife, we recommend them both."
44515,6505541,2013-08-15,5595088,Merina,It was a perfect stay! Erica and Blake were so welcoming and their dogs are really funny. They have a great sense of style. When you enter the cottage you immediately feel at home. The breakfast was great too. We would definitly recommend their cottage!
44515,6552123,2013-08-17,4242247,Cassie,Blake and Erica's beach house was absolutely lovely.  The hosts were super accommodating and breakfast was wonderful. It was in a perfect location and close to everything we hoped to visit during our stay in Monterey. We are so glad that we chose this accommodation and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you for a perfect stay! 
44515,6608847,2013-08-19,3768774,Ramey,"We couldn't have loved the cottage more! Cozy, comfortable, and clean and they even serve you an amazing breakfast each morning! We are probably even more ecstatic about the cottage as we got engaged while staying in Carmel, so we will always have fond memories AND we'll be back! I remember the reviews when I booked and we feel the same way. I don't want to stay anywhere else anymore. Lovely little cottage. "
44515,6803461,2013-08-26,2465553,Laura,"Laura and I always look forward to our vacation at Erica's and Blake's cottage. It's like having our own private getaway. We loved the improvements to the cottage patio, and the property is always neatly landscaped and beautiful. We loved being able to hear the ocean waves crashing on the beach at night. A great golf course in Pacific Grove right down the street. Wild deer can be seen in places. Erica and Blake are such terrific host' s who always make sure we have everything we need for a relaxed stay. We can't wait for the next visit to their place."
44515,6877111,2013-08-28,7948769,Katie,"We enjoyed our stay here very much.  We arrived late at night so we didn't want to disturb Erika and Blake.  We were able to find our way to the well-lit cute cottage in their back yard with their easy signs.  Two home made cookies were there upon arrival, along with a breakfast menu to hang on the door.  Every detail was thought of and we had lots of privacy with our own private patio!  We would love to return some day."
44515,7033251,2013-09-04,3142641,Imogen,What a special place to stay! We squeezed our baby and two dogs into this lovely cottage and were extremely comfortable! Erika and Blake's hospitality is boundless and it's a great location too! cannot recommend more highly! 
44515,7111390,2013-09-07,1865719,Lauren,"This was my favorite airbnb stay so far! I loved this little cottage. You'll be surrounded by a garden, and just a block away from Asilomar beach and the ocean- so you can sleep to the waves. Tons of natural lighting and windows, and seriously the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Erika & Blake are really nice, and will make you breakfast every morning and bring it to you! On cute trays and dishes! While this is in a secluded area you are still very close to downtown Pacific Grove as well as many great places to eat and shop. We really enjoyed our stay here and would love to come back.  My husband loved the cookies that came every afternoon.  (There's even heart shaped stones on the bathroom windowsill, this place is adorable.)"
44515,7153127,2013-09-09,331061,Lisa-Anne,"amazing place to stay! The bed so SO comfy, it was hard to get out =].  directions how to find the awesome cottage were great.  They've thought through everything - even brita filter water in the fridge.  We went with our two dogs and had an amazing time! "
44515,7230315,2013-09-11,3395375,Larry,"This was a great place, best AirBnB place we have encountered.  The cottage is very private/quiet and only a very short walk to the beach.  We rec'd a nice breakfast each morning which was totally unexpected and used their two aquarium passes which save $35 per person.  Overall, great place & great value!  Would certainly return if and when we go back to the Monterey area."
44515,7299160,2013-09-15,5437333,Laure,"We spent 2 nights in the cottage and we simply LOVED IT!
It was out first air bnb experience and what a first time! 
The place is lovely, as in the pictures, and really independent from the main house. 
We haven't met Blake but Erika was very friendly. She brought us a delicious breakfast every morning at our preferred time. Breakfast was delicious and cookies too. 
The location is great too! Very easy access to Monterey by car (we used  the aquarium passes and had a wonderful time) and walking distance to Asilomar state beach. 
I would definitely recommend it if you plan to visit Monterey! 
Thank you Erika & Blake!"
44515,7370137,2013-09-17,8159912,Camela,"This was my first Airbnb trip and it was perfect!  We spent the weekend in Monterey and my boyfriend and I were instantly in love when we arrived.  Everything was so thoughtful and well done -- from the directions and decor to the amenities and the breakfast.  The cottage is private, super cozy and well-kept and we really felt at home during our stay.  The aquarium was a big reason we came to the area, so the included passes were definitely a plus, as is the location.  The cottage is in a nice, quiet neighborhood just a short walk from the beach and a 10-minute drive to the Aquarium & Cannery Row. Erika and Blake were very friendly, accommodating hosts and I'm looking forward to coming back and recommending this place to others!"
44515,7452322,2013-09-21,5424726,Janna,The cottage is clean and quiet and looks just like the pictures.  The hosts were friendly and brought us a nice breakfast every morning.  The cottage is in a nice neighborhood and it is easy to get to Monterey and other locations.  I totally recommend it!
44515,7503742,2013-09-23,6482327,Karen & Joel Mettler,"Beyond amazing!! Beyond charming and comfortable. Erika and Blake go above and beyond. Lifetime memories were made. A very very special cottage. I feel so fortunate to have celebrated our 10 year anniversary in such a beautiful place with the finest linens, boatloads of charm, beautiful garden, loads of private and the crashing waves. Every detail has been carried through. We slept to the sounds of the ocean and walked or bikes to everywhere we wanted to go. A magical place. Generous hosts that even tried to to give us money back because we didn't need breakfast (because we went out). No way would we accept! Generous people with loads if integrity. In the words if Larry David: pretty..pretty... Good. Ha! Actually it was better than perfect. I'm still on a cloud. I would have paid double!! "
44515,7577255,2013-09-25,4854050,Edwin,"Blake and Erika were the perfect hosts!  The cottage is absolutely charming and in a very secluded backyard.  Very quiet inside the cottage, but outside you can hear the surf pounding.  Very relaxing. We loved the place, so did our puppy.  This is our second booking with airbnb and we are not disappointed!  And the cookies!  Chocolate chip cookies to die for.  We had these waiting for us when we checked in and more when we checked out.   What else can we say?  We TOTALLY RECOMMEND this cottage.  We'd love to return one of these days...."
44515,7655927,2013-09-28,2727229,Bret,"We were lucky to find this place. A last minute reservation made only possible by a last minute cancelation on someone else's part. Erika and Blake have a great place and they were very friendly accommodating hosts.  It's close to downtown Pacific Grove and the attractions of Monterey, but it's also quite enough to be very relaxing. Thank you Erika and Blake, we had a great time! "
44515,7748176,2013-10-01,8514743,Bob,"We stayed for a couple of nights to enjoy a long weekend at Erica and Blake's charming cottage. Everything was perfect-even very clear instructions for parking and signage for us to make our way to the cottage. Erica and Blake have thought of everything that you might need to enjoy your stay and were very helpful leading up to the trip. The cottage is in a perfect location for exploring the area and we would highly recommend a stay in this perfect little guest house. Thank you so much Erica and Blake! We'll be back!

44515,7813410,2013-10-04,1439533,Rick,"Look no farther, this large private cottage with private court yard is amazing. Very well furnished, large comfy pillow top bed. Only 5 minute drive into Monterey, It was so nice staying here  we hated to leave.If you are staying in  Monterey you will not be disappointed staying with Erika and Blake"
44515,7867354,2013-10-07,1709536,Chris,Our stay with Erika and Blake was a pleasure.  We came down for an event in Carmel and wanted a retreat type place to stay.  They really know how to take care of you and provide a lovely cottage.  We so enjoy the quiet and location near the beach walking trails and of course close to town and Carmel.  Would stay with them again.  Thank you!
44515,8165092,2013-10-19,5192278,Stuart,"The perfect AirBnB experience! Couldn't fault a (Website hidden by Airbnb) many little touches and thoughtful additions to the cottage. Directions to the cottage, signage and communication overall were exemplary. Erika and Blake couldn't have been more welcoming, yet still gave us complete privacy and space. One of the comfiest beds we've ever slept in and we were sad to leave such a quaint cottage in such a gorgeous part of the world. Thumbs up and hugely recommended!!"
44515,8291010,2013-10-24,3288382,Des & Vessy,Absolutely Perfect!
44515,8328636,2013-10-26,2155671,Jeremy,"Erika & Blake's cottage was wonderful, clean, comfortable and perfect for us. Erika made us a delicious breakfast and was very gracious in letting us use the guest passes to the aquarium on the day we checked out. We would stay here again and recommend their cottage to anyone else looking for a stay in Monterey."
44515,8401460,2013-10-29,4160771,Emma,"Our stay with Ericka and Blake was absolutely fantastic!  They have thought of everything, from cute signposts showing us the way to a great breakfast every morning.  It looks exactly as it does in the pictures - clean and beautifully decorated.

The best bit has to be the bed!  It was huge and so comfy - we would have quite liked to have taken it home with us.

We also made use of the free aquarium passes they leave for guests, which we would definitely recommend - if only to see the cute sea otters up close.  The pass also gets you discount at the gift shop.

Look no further - stay here!!"
44515,8442426,2013-10-31,8074293,Corrine,"We stayed at this cute cottage for two nights. Loved it! Erika is a fantastic hostess.  All the comforts of home, decorated beautifully in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of a gorgeous beach and walking path. Lots of extras that we are not used to from airbnb including organic soaps/bath products, king size bed with nice bedding and memory foam topper, teas and coffee, chocolate chip cookies upon arrival and a lovely breakfast delivered to our door. Highly recommend as a sweet jumping off point for a Monterey peninsula vaca. "
44515,8481846,2013-11-02,332996,Will,"Blake and Erika were awesome! The cottage is wonderful and set on their absolutely beautiful property. It's a quick walk to the ocean with a really nice walking/running path to walk along the shore. If all of that isn't enough, they cooked us a delicious breakfast and they provided free tickets to the aquarium. We'll definitely be staying here again when we're back in Monterey."
44515,8524239,2013-11-04,1210741,Trudi,This is our third time visiting this amazing cottage and we love it more every time. The new enclosed patio is a little slice of heaven and we couldn't ask for a lovelier place to stay or nicer hosts. Back next month!!! Doug and Trudi
44515,8600058,2013-11-07,410680,Mitch And Susan,"The cottage is in an ideal location; it's quiet there and yet close to everything.
We loved our two-night stay and would gladly have stayed longer. We already look forward to our next trip there."
44515,8651248,2013-11-11,4168982,Tom,"We loved staying with you again.  You're great hosts, the cottage is in an excellent location, and we always have a good time."
44515,8703659,2013-11-12,1452471,Tony & Yilin,"We arrived early to The Cottage and it was a charm.  Prior to our check-in time, Erika and Blake made their Monterey Bay Aquarium passes available to us, and we had a blast visiting the otters.  When we returned to The Cottage, our hosts had prepared the space immaculately and had left clear instructions.  The room was spacious yet cozy and had all the amenities we would have wanted and more - kitchenette to prepare coffee, ample lighting, heater, reading space, etc.. In the morning, Blake brought us organic breakfast at the exact time we had requested on their meal card, and it was the best breakfast on bed we've ever had.  We hope to visit again soon!
"
44515,8728108,2013-11-14,8904475,Julia,"Wonderful place to stay! Very lovely decor, peaceful setting and just a short walk to the beach. Would definitely stay here again. "
44515,8779095,2013-11-18,7706917,Saryne,"Had the most amazing time here. So great, in fact, that we booked another weekend while we were there to come back in a few months. Some of the highlights: beautiful and clean space. Gracious hosts, who were kind and helpful without being intrusive. A 5 minute walk to the beach. Got to bring our pup who loved the beach.  Really great space. Felt so private and special. "
44515,8980072,2013-11-30,9472282,Jocelyn,"We really enjoyed our stay. The place was so cozy. The bed very comfortable. The hosts were so nice and brought us delicious breakfast each morning. Also, the nearby beach was gorgeous!! We would love to stay here again."

44515,9124827,2013-12-09,5644098,Emily,"This is a really pretty little cottage with everything for a comfortable stay.  We were here during a December cold storm but were cozy and warm, the heater does a great job.  Blake's breakfast eggs were really good, and this comes from someone who does not really like eggs all that much.  We brought our dog with us, there are a ton of local walks to take her on...to the beach, around the block, down a nice foot path nearby.  It is super quiet and a beautiful place they have there.  The king size bed is really comfortable!!  Highly recommended!"
44515,9158579,2013-12-10,6358263,Shola,"I originally reserved Erika's and Blake's cottage for two nights, but later had to change it for only one night (which they were super helpful and kind about!), and we were so sad! Their cottage is super cozy and perfectly close to the fisherman's wharf, Carmel, and all of the Monterey beaches. We had so much fun, and their home is beautiful. And our pup loved all of the open space around their property! We're hoping to come back soon for sure. "
44515,9192283,2013-12-12,5154262,Cherie,"Erika and Blake's cottage was just lovely.  The bed is incredibly comfortable and the space is well appointed, including having an impressive heater.  [My love and I stayed for two nights during a cold snap and we were as cozy and as comfortable as two bugs in a rug.]  Blake cooked us breakfast both mornings and brought it to us at the time we requested.  The aquarium passes and location of the cottage (within walking distance to Asilomar beach and just minutes by car to Cannery Row) were also wonderful.  We look forward to staying here again and highly recommend to anyone visiting the Monterey coast.  Thank you Erika and Blake!   "
44515,9224621,2013-12-15,9049854,Elizabeth,"In a word--wonderful.  Great place, convenient location very close to shoreline and charming downtown Pacific Grove near the terminus of 17 Mile Drive.  Only minutes from Monterey and a short hop onto Hwy 1. Hosts were perfect, very responsive to all inquiries, accommodating in every way, and served up a delicious breakfast with awesome coffee.  The Tudor casita is exactly as described and photographed.  Charming and quiet. Such a delightful change from the standard hotel experience.  Very private with a really comfy bed. This is a great time of year to sightsee the area.  Very few people on Hwy 1 south during the week (Dec. 11-14). Everything decorated for the holidays. The butterflies are in the PG sanctuary and the elephant seals are coming in to their rookery near Hearst Castle. We caught an excellent run of weather.  Cool but sunny.  I'd return tomorrow if I could!"
44515,9269567,2013-12-17,9913902,Katie,"Words like perfect, adorable, wonderful and peaceful all come to mind.  Seriously, we could not have been happier with our short stay in this amazing little cottage. My boyfriend and I picked this place for a quick, relaxing getaway together. When we arrived, we were greeted by chocolate chip cookies and welcoming signs. We took a quick 7 minute walk to the beach and watched the sunset, then decided we liked the place so much that we didn't want to go out and decided instead to cook dinner there! So, we picked some things up at a local store, shared a great bottle of wine and enjoyed cooking a lovely little meal so that we could enjoy the comfortable and cozy surroundings. Everything is so cute and clean, and the house has pretty much anything you could need, whether you want to stay in and treat it as a little home away from home, or go out. The bed is heavenly, and they bring you delicious home-cooked breakfast each morning at whatever time is convenient for you. The next day we took an hour drive south to Big Sur, then came back in time to try one of the restaurants they recommended, which of course was also lovely!  This little cottage is perfect for pretty much anyone looking for a peaceful little getaway in a sleepy little beach town. It has the warm touch of a home, while also making you feel like you are on vacation and taken good care of. Everything from the quality soaps left in the bathroom to the fresh flowers -- we couldn't have asked for more. Though we didn't get to talk to them much, both Erika and Blake were really nice when they dropped off breakfast and said hello. We wish we could have stayed forever, and if we are so lucky, look forward to any opportunity we'd have to go back! "
44515,9316833,2013-12-21,115539,Carr,Yes this delightful cottage is located just a couple of blocks from the gorgeous waves and rocks between Monterey and Carmel.  The location is wonderful and the bonus is your own private hideaway that has style to savor. From the brick walkway and patios which are interspersed with vintage Dutch tiles plus a few Mexican beauties to your own private patio. Privacy is further insured by  leaded glass over the windows. Snuggle down in plush bedding or lounge in a comfortable chair.  All your needs are met in petite kitchen area and charming bathroom. The mixture of older dramatic trees with lovely plantings in abundance add to the complete enjoyment. Take long walks along the ocean into fun downtown Pacific Grove and wander back thru artistic cottages and turn of the century homes. Enjoy
44515,9343412,2013-12-23,9196262,Crystal,"My boyfriend and I decided to take a weekend getaway and this place was the perfect place for it!  Blake and Erika were more than accommodating - we were shown to the guest house where we were staying when we arrived, were offered help with our bags, and every morning we were given a delicious granola and yogurt breakfast.  The cottage was equipped with anything we would need: a kitchen if you wanted to cook, enough fresh towels and soaps, and an extra blanket in case we got cold.  I loved that we were able to bring our dog on our trip, and it was a great perk to be able to go to the aquarium with their guest passes.  We were only a short drive away from downtown Monterey, and a quick walk away from the beach.  I would highly recommend this place if you're visiting Monterey!  Thanks again Erika and Blake!"
44515,9380244,2013-12-25,8925212,Sapna,"We heard about Erika and Blake's cottage from friends who had stayed there before and it seemed like the perfect place to spend our first wedding anniversary. It definitely lived up to its reviews!! The cottage is the perfect size for a couple and is very cute and comfy. Loved the decor and the set up of the cottage. It is a 5 minute walk from the beach which is a great spot to enjoy the sunset with your special someone :) The cookies were delicious, as was the home-made breakfast. The cute puppy that greets you at breakfast and the free passes to the Monterey aquarium are icing on the cake! Definitely recommend this cottage to any couple looking for a romantic and fun weekend getaway. Erika & Blake - thanks for a memorable first wedding anniversary! :)"
44515,9405011,2013-12-27,9691187,Alex,"We had a wonderful time at Erika & Blake's home.  They are very welcoming and nice people.  

The room was located in the back side of the main home.  There was a private door and entrance to the room.  The room was everything we needed and it was very clean and organized.  Everything was in good working condition (cable TV + Wifi internet, small refrigerator/freezer, utensils, cups, pans, dishes, etc.).

Everything is within a close proximity of each other.  The beach was within walking distance from the home (approximately 0.5 miles).  Trader Joe and Whole Foods was a couple miles away.  Mall is also located close to the home.

Lastly, cookies were amazing!  We saw a couple reviews mentioning the cookies, and they do live up to the hype!

Cheers!

The Hu Family"
44515,9460414,2013-12-30,88533,Dominique,"Our 3rd year in a row at Erika and Blake's place. Winter is gorgeous in Monterey (clear and sunny, if a little brisk). They were wonderfully responsive and while they were out of town during this trip sadly (it was during the holidays), they were kind enough to offer us ""breakfast cash"" each morning. Wasn't necessary but representative of the incredible hospitality of these hosts!"
44515,9536121,2014-01-02,1210741,Trudi,This is our favorite place in the world--we love it...only wish we could come more often. Thanks Erika and Blake for another magnificent stay. Doug and Trudi
44515,9885214,2014-01-17,9139491,Alex,"What an amazing place! Erika and Blake were very accommodating and their cottage is perfect.  Breakfast was yummy and always on time,  and Blake pointed out some local birds when he dropped it off.  The patio is very nice,  and the set up with a second bed was great.  The cottage is so close to the beach.  It is worth every penny.  Would definitely stay there again."
44515,9948827,2014-01-21,8144275,William,"What a marvelous place to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary! This cottage is cozy, comfortable, and convenient. Set in a lovely yard with beautiful landscaping and brickwork, the cottage is close enough to the beach to smell the sea air and hear the waves. The furnishings are quite comfortable, the décor is tasteful, the mini kitchen is fabulous (we enjoyed several meals in), and the location is close to everything we wanted to see. Erika is a lovely, pleasant, very friendly hostess with lots of helpful suggestions on what to see and do. We also enjoyed eating breakfast in before starting our day. The aquarium tickets and extremely delectable cookies are icing on the cake. We have sent the link to this room to all of our friends and family and have highly recommended it. This was a far more enjoyable experience than staying in a hotel. We will definitely stay at the cottage again... thank you, Erika and Blake, for a most memorable anniversary!"
44515,10021072,2014-01-26,10661981,Monica,"Wonderful little cottage with easy access to the beautiful coast. Clean, quiet, well-maintained, with very easy and accommodating hosts. The outdoor patio was a bonus to catch some rays of sun, and the kitchen had everything I need to prepare some low-key meals. Very highly recommended. "
44515,10066883,2014-01-28,11104620,Katie,"Had an absolutely lovely stay in Monterey, mainly because of how nice Erika and Blake's cottage was.

If you're passing through the area and are looking for a place to stay, this should definitely be at the top of your list."
44515,10145642,2014-02-03,7706917,Saryne,"We love staying here...feels like our home away from home. I really cant list all the wonderful things but some are: its location is awesome, the cottage is wonderfully decorated, comfortable, private and has everything you need. The owners are perfect- sweet, friendly, helpful. We love staying here! We will be absolutely be back soon. "
44515,10242436,2014-02-09,532883,Cam,"Just finished spending five days at the Matheson's cottage.  Erika and Blake are excellent hosts.   The cottage is pet friendly and is located behind the main house with a private courtyard.  It is cozy and comfortable with all amenities as advertised.  The neighborhood is quiet and ideal for taking walks and also within walking distance of downtown and the beach.  A superb alternative to a motel/hotel room!

44515,10294112,2014-02-11,199215,Hassan,"We checked into Erika and Blake's cottage for a weekend trip to Monterey. The place is wonderful! We've had a great time in town (following their handpicked recommendations) as well as in the cottage. It had everything that we needed and is beautifully furnished. The location is also very close to the coast, so walking around the neighborhood was a real treat. 
Highly recommend!! "
44515,10332303,2014-02-14,10179336,Michael,"This is the second time we have stayed at Erika and Blake's cottage and again, we were not disappointed.  The cottage is located in back of the main house, with a large courtyard in which one can enjoy a happy hour drink!  The cottage is cozy and comfortable; the kitchen is fully equipped...we even ate dinner in a few times.  The beach is a 5 minute walk;  the Fishwife restaurant is a mere 10 minute walk.  The passes to the Monterey Aquarium is a lovely perk as is the breakfast each morning.  We will continue to return to this lovely abode.  We highly recommend the place to everyone; a much better alternative to a motel room!"
44515,10446637,2014-02-19,6150066,Malte & Silke,"Erika and Blake are wonderful and welcoming hosts with a beautiful home. The guest cottage is just perfect: lovingly furnished and decorated with everything you might need. Due to the fact that it is located behind the main house you can enjoy privacy and your own inviting terrace. It is also the many nice details that make this place very special such as fresh flowers, the selection of complimentary teas or the fresh breakfast offer. We also appreciated the good location: The ocean is almost next door and there are plenty of good cafés and restaurants in walking distance nearby. It was great to get free access to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which is definitely worth a trip. Besides that there is plenty to do in the surrounding area: The Big Sur NP is less than an hour away and Monterey is a great location to spot whales. To sum it up: We highly recommend Erika's and Blake's wonderful cottage! "
44515,10493562,2014-02-22,10971731,Braydon,We had such a great stay with Blake and Erika's. It was probably my most favorite airbnb stay. We beyond enjoyed the location being so close to the water. We went on walks every morning. The breakfast was heavenly and this couple is very punctual which I really appreciate. I would not hesitate staying here again or recommending it. Such a fun cute place. These two know how to host:)
44515,10527348,2014-02-24,742443,Kevin,"We're pretty experienced with airbnb now, and haven't had a bad experience yet.  Erika and Blake's cottage in Pacific Grove is hands down the most idyllic and relaxing place we have stayed through airbnb.   It is a 10-minute walk to Asilomar Beach, and a 1-minute walk to a bus stop which will make it easy to get to downtown Monterey.  Make sure to try Blake's egg breakfast.  It is delicious.  We hope to come back before long."
44515,10656289,2014-03-02,2592494,Alison,We absolutely loved our stay here. The cottage is just as described and pictured-- if not better. Both Erika and Blake were very friendly and kind but not intrusive. If we are ever in Central California again we most certainly will be staying here. Thanks again!
44515,10997278,2014-03-17,4168982,Tom,"We love staying with Erika & Blake.  Their place is charming, the location is ideal, and they are great hosts!  See you again soon."
44515,11705479,2014-04-13,4261549,Michelle,"Return visit, and very nice it was too. 
Cottage was clean, all the facilities we needed.
Enjoyed our stay, thanks Erika and Blake"
44515,11853339,2014-04-17,2183108,Andrew,"Erika and Blake could not be there when we arrived but the signs said it all and finding our cottage was fun! The cottage is small but not as small as it looks in the pictures. It is however very comfortable, well appointed and furnished and in a wonderful location just 5 minutes walk from the coast. The breakfasts and Aquarium tickets were a great bonus. Our hosts were very helpful and provided invaluable information both in the Cottage and when answering our questions. Overall we could not of asked for better and we were sad to have to leave. "
44515,11945775,2014-04-20,10041175,Carla,"A delightful cottage with friendly, accommodating hosts.  Being served a yummy breakfast prepared fresh daily was an indulgence we savored - especially during our wedding anniversary vacation. A well stocked kitchenette, abundant linens, a private courtyard, beautifully landscaped, a short, easy walk down to the beach, & gracious hosts who were available but not intrusive all combined to make this a memorable stay - one we'll definitely repeat!  The best, pet-friendly vacation we've shared to date.  Thanks, Erika & Blake."
44515,12143444,2014-04-24,8189888,Michelle,"We just spent 3 lovely days at this magical cottage by the sea.  It's in such a wonderful location, tucked away in privacy and with thoughtful and interesting decor.  The kitchenette was well used by us, and it is mighty indeed!  The cookies were addictive and the tea was blissful.  Just sitting on the porch listening to the waves with beautiful touches in the garden and exterior of the cottage was one of my favorite things to do.  Erika was more than accommodating and even provided us with extra tea!  Thank you for such a wonderful vacation."
44515,12325583,2014-04-29,9833292,Anthony,"Wonderful place. Wonderful people. All around pleasant and Very quiet:)

44515,12602259,2014-05-06,9712014,Caitie,"We absolutely loved Blake and Erika's cottage. It was quiet and private and perfect for our honeymoon. The hosts were so friendly and sweet, the food was delicious, and the surrounding area is beautiful! We will definitely be back. Thank you so much!"
44515,12738276,2014-05-10,8917022,Edel,"Erika & Blake’s garden cottage is a most charming place. The cottage is well equipped, has a wonderful bed and overall is great value. They offer breakfast and have two guest cards for a free visit to the Monterey Aquarium which is really worth a visit. Parking is available in front of the house.
It is only a two minutes walk to the incredibly beautiful and peaceful beach side. Walk along the coast trail to Pebble Beach and take a picnic with you. There is a great bakery (Pavel’s) and Deli-grocery shop in the town center (Forrest Street). Pacific Grove was our favorite place in the Monterey County, so laid back set in great nature.
"
44515,12995743,2014-05-17,11005499,Laurie,"Blake and Erika’s cottage is even prettier than its pictures and very welcoming. It is in a lovely quiet neighborhood, just blocks to the ocean and a short walk to historic Asilomar, where we enjoyed the gorgeous view and had coffee on the deck of the lodge. We walked the neighborhood trails, took the local bus to the Monterey Bay Aquarium with the guest tickets provided, went to lunch at the Red House Café, and enjoyed the freedom from parking and driving. Pacific Grove is a charming town to explore.  Breakfast on the private courtyard patio of the cottage was delicious and a little luxury that was much appreciated. This was my first airbnb experience and an excellent one."
44515,13062239,2014-05-19,8354916,Gracie,My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED staying at Blake and Erika's cottage! We've already recommended their place to all of our friends. Would most definitely come back again!
44515,13464006,2014-05-28,6726273,Collin,"What a wonderful vacation! My wife and I visited the Cottage as our first airbnb experience and we couldn't be happier. The location is perfect. It's a 5 minute walk to the ocean and it's perfectly positioned in between Monterey and Carmel. The location is also perfect for a drive up the coast on 17 Mile Drive and Highway 1 to Point Lobos State Park (breathtaking beauty) and Big Sur among other spots. The Cottage itself is cozy, comfortable and ideal for any couple looking for a private getaway. The enclosed patio was ideal for relaxation. Blake and Erika were very respectful of our privacy and were very helpful with great lunch and dinner suggestions. It was the most difficult vacation spot we've ever had to leave. Those memories will last a lifetime. Thanks Blake and Erika!"
44515,13534825,2014-05-30,12973870,Jessica,"My fiance and I are planning our wedding in Monterey and needed a place to stay with our big pup.  The cottage worked out perfectly for us!  It was clean, well-maintained, and a cozy place to return to after running around the town during the day. It's private with a beautiful courtyard/garden surrounding it and close to the beach and nice walking trails.  We also loved the coffee and breakfast they provided each morning.  I'd recommend anyone going to the Pacific Grove/Monterey area to stay at the cottage, and I would love to stay here again in the future!"
44515,13644374,2014-06-02,7555359,Alicia,This was our favorite Airbnb experience yet. Erika and Blake's cottage is cozy and clean. The cookies waiting for us when we arrived were a nice touch! We also loved the breakfasts each morning and the exceptionally comfy bed. The cottage is a short walk to Asilomar Beach. We loved everything about this stay. Thanks Erika and Blake!
44515,13811278,2014-06-05,9905127,Manon,"We have a great time in Monterrey and in the cottage of Blake and Erika. Even if it's was a large place, it was very cosy and comfortable, with everything inside and with a very nice garden. Two passes was Avery great value as well. Thanks for the nice breakfast and amazing cookies as well for your help Blake. "
44515,13872309,2014-06-07,1859041,Rich And Shannon,The cottage is perfect and the bed is divine. We would book here again in a heartbeat!
44515,14219849,2014-06-15,12209433,Bridget,"This was our first airbnb experience and we couldn't have been happier with Erika and Blakes' beach cottage. They both gave us great suggestions on what to do/where to eat that made for a memorable trip. Our favorite part of our stay was enjoying a delicious breakfast in the garden each morning. It is true what they say, the bed is like a cloud! We have already recommended this place to our friends and family. Thanks Erika and Blake, you are fabulous hosts!!"
44515,14460526,2014-06-20,9603494,Kay,"The cottage was lovely and private with a door between the host's yard and our small garden.  The space would be ideal for one or two people.  It was a little tight for 2 adults and 1 child.  The neighborhood was quiet, and the cottage was very close to the beach, and close to major attractions in the area.  The breakfast arrived at the time that we requested every day.  There were ants in the kitchen sink and counter, although we were very careful not to leave any food crumbs.  "
44515,14592202,2014-06-23,6200998,Rosemary,This cottage is the perfect getaway! So quaint and comfortable. We love staying here.
44515,14732655,2014-06-25,13341615,Emma,The cottage was so cute and had everything we needed. It was well signposted where to park and how to access the cottage.  There was clear information on wifi and breakfast. We met Blake the next morning when he delivered breakfast. He was really friendly. Would recommend this property. 
44515,14851213,2014-06-28,11203309,Sarah,"My husband and I fell in love with the place, which was exactly as pictured. I think we might go back to the Monterey/Carmel/Pacific Grove area just to be able to stay at Erika and Blake's adorable cottage again!

They have really thought of everything, from the signs pointing you back to the cottage to the card you can place on your door to order breakfast delivered first thing in the morning! Incredible. Highly highly recommend. Thanks, Erika and Blake!"
44515,14950870,2014-06-30,3131459,Mary,"Extremely cute place, very well thought out and comfy. The private patio is lovely. It's clear the hosts have designed the cosy space with attention to detail and function. Fresh baked cookies at arrival and Blake's delivery of breakfast made it over the top. Thank you for being such fantastic hosts! As other reviews say, the cottage is minutes from the beach. We slept with the windows open and enjoyed the breeze and sounds of the waves. This place is also an exceptional value. Perfect! "
44515,15086631,2014-07-02,12015210,Elise,"First time with airbnb. Wasn't sure what to expect. But Erika and Blake's listing wasn't what they listed. It was way better. From the moment we pulled up you could see how much they cared about the guest experience. From little painted signs directing you where to go, to freshly baked cookies waiting for you when you made it in. 
Just the walk from the front of the house to the back cottage was an experience in itself. This home is beautifully landscaped and you can feel how much time and effort they take into keeping things just right. 
Not only was Erika pleasant and truly welcoming (breakfast she makes is awesome), but the fact that they take dogs (even our 105 pound and growing mastiff) was phenomenal.
The cottage was clean and well maintained. It had everything you could need for a stay. You had all the privacy you could want, like you were in your own little house, with a great neighbor who was willing to be there and help out the second you called.
We will definitely be booking this spot on our next trip to the area."
44515,15210702,2014-07-05,6902968,Holly,"Staying at Erika & Blake's Cottage has been by far my favorite AirBnB experience! The neighborhood is quiet, the bed is super comfortable, breakfast is outstanding, and they are within walking distance to the beach!

We met Erika during our stay and she was such a sweetheart. She was super helpful in giving us tips on things to do while we explored the area. We'll definitely stay again should we find ourselves in the area in the future."
44515,15386445,2014-07-08,1563650,Joel,"The cottage was wonderful! Very private suited our needs perfectly. The kitchenette was great for breakfasts and small meals, and Erika and Blake were great hosts. I would definitely stay there again."
44515,15665886,2014-07-14,5850371,Kim & Alistair,"An amazing place to stay for the Monterey area. Wonderful hosts who provide an amazing breakfast and wow the cookies!! The bed is so so comfy. A great location, don't miss out on a walk to the beach for sunset. Highly recommended place to stay and a lovely stop on our honeymoon.
"
44515,15816114,2014-07-16,14382936,Warren,"We loved our stay at Erica and Blake's cottage. the place is magical, with a sense of another time. Entrance to the cottage passes you through several garden gates and a lovely garden courtyard. The location is convenient to town and a stones throw to an amazingly beautiful ocean reserve. An added treat of delicious coffee and breakfast delivered to the cottage by a cheerful host and pouch made for an elegant, laid back stay."
44515,15945745,2014-07-19,10933288,Gina,"Erika & Blake were lovely hosts!  We only saw them a couple of times but their communication skills through every form was incredible! What you see online is all true, it is clean, pet friendly, and well-appointed.  Although, they did not give all the details in the listing, they forget to mention you get your own secret garden to eat breakfast in, read a book , or just enjoy the ocean air and beautiful garden!  We sat in the garden for breakfast every morning and to relax and read every afternoon.  It was incredible! Fred and I thought this was the best way a couple could end their honeymoon: privacy, a beautiful location, breakfast each morning, and aquarium passes.  We would love to come back and stay at the cottage again because of it being so peaceful!
The location of the cottage is spectacular!  We had great restaurants and a quaint downtown five minutes from cottage. We were two minutes from the 17-mile drive of Pebble Beach, and 15 minutes from Carmel.  In addition we drove to Big Sur to go hiking and that was about an hour away.  This cottage has great location to everything tourist and local you could want to do."
44515,16054176,2014-07-21,12320235,Nancy And Chuck,Blake and Erika have an awesome little cottage. They were our first experience with Air Bnb and we couldn't have been more happy with our choice. We didnt want to leave and staying with them was the highlight of our trip. The breakfast was so good and arrived when we requested it.  I left my cell phone charger and camara charger and she imediately contacted me and asked if I wanted to pick them up on our way back home or if I wanted her to mail them. So cozy....we look forward to returning again the next time we visit the area.
44515,16242844,2014-07-24,12584072,Lea,Myself and my husband spent three nights in Erika and Blake's place and it was fantastic! The pair have spent a lot of time and effort creating a wonderful space. The breakfasts were delicious and the passes for the aquarium are a wonderful extra. Myself and my husband would 110% recommend this place to anyone planning on staying in the Pacific Grove/Monterey area.
44515,16759974,2014-08-02,8553485,Louise,"Scrummy cookies, beautiful property and a perfect location. We didn't want to leave and we loved having breakfast in the morning with the hummingbirds and wandering down to the beach to watch the seals and explore the rock pools. 5* property and the tickets to the aquarium were an added bonus. Would definitely recommend. Excellent value."
44515,17549958,2014-08-14,484944,Srina,"You couldn't ask for a better location if you want to be close to the ocean. This is a wonderful cottage, Erika & Blake are great hosts & make you feel very welcome. The neighborhood is quiet & the breakfasts are an added plus. My dog Sophie thoroughly enjoyed her stay & is ready to return, she especially loves the freedom on the beaches in Pacific Grove!"
44515,17673135,2014-08-16,14585722,Louise,"We had a great stay in Pacific Grove. Erica and Blake are very friendly and helpful. Nice breakfast and on perfect time. The cottage was supercute and neighbourhood nice. Close to the beach and golf courses. 

This was our first airBnb stay and I hope the rest of them will be as great!"
44515,18071617,2014-08-21,4940932,Manda,"Erika and Blake's cottage was absolutely perfect for a birthday getaway for my boyfriend. The place was clean, adorable and only a 5 minute walk from the beach. The breakfasts were yummy and served at your choice of time.

We can't wait to go back and stay and would highly recommend this cottage for your getaway in Monterey!"
44515,18295131,2014-08-25,2465553,Laura,this is our third yeat/visit the place is very close to the beach you can walk to it and it has a full kitchen so you can prepare meals if you want  the bed is very comfortable we slept like babies  and will book for next year 
44515,18619364,2014-08-29,17091705,James,"Erika and Blake were extremely accommodating. I messed up the booking and booked it for a day later than I should have. Discovered the mistake a couple hours before arriving and contacted them, they jumped around to accommodate us at no extra cost.

The cottage was lovely and exactly as per the description. It is secluded and allows as much privacy as required and is only a short walk to the beach. 

We loved the cottage and would recommend it to anyone staying in Monterey.
"
44515,18869589,2014-09-02,6530655,Karon,"Erika and Blake were unfortunately not home during my recent visit, however, that did not let it stop them from leaving me some of their hospitality in the form of breakfast goodies.

This was my second visit to their lovely cottage and this time I extended my stay by a couple more days.  The location is perfect, the accommodations very comfortable. Their two dogs get along with my cocker spaniel, so she feels like she is on vacation as well.  Looking forward to my next visit,"
44515,19114784,2014-09-07,9747130,Diana,"My boyfriend and I attended a wedding over the weekend and we decided to stay here.  Erika and Blake's cottage is just amazing and perfect.  The wedding was at the Monterey Plaza hotel and we were able to take a short cab ride with no problem.  The beach is just a few miles away, the private patio area is beautiful.  The weekend was just amazing!  The breakfast in the morning was perfect.  Everything about this place is perfection!  You will not regret staying here!  "
44515,19402655,2014-09-12,12160123,Gary,"Blake and Erika are excellent hosts and very considerate.  Their cottage is very tastefully decorated, clean, comfortable and situated in a very quiet neighborhood in a charming town.  (It is a studio, not with a separate bedroom).  The best thing is the ocean at the end of their street.  A very beautiful stretch of coastline. Just as nice as 17-mile drive, free, and less crowded!  We brought our binoculars and watched otters and seals close by.  In the distance, we were absolutely thrilled to watch a humpback whale ""feeding frenzy""!  We enjoyed a very relaxing, fun 5 day visit."
44515,19508460,2014-09-14,11698636,Steve,"Hi, we stayed here for 2 nights in September 2014. We were driving down the coast road from San Francisco to LA and booked a stop here to visit the Monterey Peninsula. 

This property is an absolute gem. It's location, the communication from Blake and Erika on how to get there, how to get in if they were not there on our arrival (which they weren't)  was excellent. The breakfast supplied was a great start to the day and to be enjoyed in the privacy of your own patio area. A humming bird joined us each morning at breakfast time, fascinating watching it hover and the noise it makes. 

5 minutes walk and you are on the beach front where you can walk round to the Fisherman's Wife restaurant. 

5 minutes drive and you can join the ""17 mile drive"", €10 dollars to do the drive, but worth every cent. Half way round and you come across one of the most famous golf courses in the World, Pebble Beach. Well worth a stop and walk around if you are into golf, or even if your not. 

Carry on along the ""17 mile drive"" and you get to Carmel. It was a Saturday when we were there and parking was difficult. A suggestion maybe to start at Carmel and come back via Pebble Beach and the ""17 mile drive"".

Whatever you do, there can't be many other properties that match this. It was as I said, a gem.

Steve and Jackie, Disley, England"
44515,19666932,2014-09-16,14752092,Robert,"Beautiful accommodation at a great location, just a short and easy walk to the pacific.  This is a great cottage and the best breakfast we had the whole vacation.  Exactly as advertised, we loved it. "
44515,19765705,2014-09-18,11623807,Martine,"What a beautiful place! The cottage was perfect, tastefully decorated, very confortable, very clean and with the bonus of a lovely garden area to have the delicious breakfasts supplied by Erika & Blake, accompanied by a hummingbird. The beach close by is amazing. We wish we could have stayed much longer than two nights. Loved it. "
44515,20078928,2014-09-23,4601059,Tobie,"Our hosts, Erika & Blake, made us feel welcome from the very first correspondence with them and continued throughout our stay.
The property was beautiful; the cottage was beautiful, well appointed and well equipped.  I went to rest, and it was peaceful and quiet there, and they respected our privacy, as well as were very accommodating.  Breakfast was fabulous; coffee very good, and served right when requested.  If you don't want to rest, there is plenty to do to fill your days, and everything is close by.  Hope to return to their corner of paradise!"
44515,20177642,2014-09-25,10926707,Glenda,"What a fantastic spot! So private and charming a cottage as you will find. Great location in Pacific Grove - we are SO glad we didn't stay in neighbouring Carmel as was our original intent.
We ran on the coast trails and could hear the ocean surf at night....the cottage was clean, very comfortable and very well equipped. Erika and Blake (and wee Camilla) were so generous and accommodating. Left my wallet at the cottage when we departed and Erika posted it to me without delay - great relief! Great recommendations for restaurants and local fare."
44515,20327709,2014-09-28,2240497,Ann,"Utterly charming cottage in a perfect location.  We love Pacific Grove anyway, and being able to walk to Asilomar conference center (check out the Julia Morgan buildings) and to the fabulous Asilomar beach and the coastline there with tide pools, then back to the cottage was a dream getaway.  Complete with being able to have our senior dog with us.  Erica and Blake were very welcoming - we met them while they delivered our tasty breakfast and communication before arrival was considerate and clear.   Arrival cookies were a nice touch.  Served a fresh, tasty egg (or yoghurt) breakfast at the time requested and perfectly strong coffee for this bay area native.  The cottage's brick courtyard, birds, trees were all so sweet and restful, very quiet neighborhood.  And, the accommodations very tasteful and comfortable, great bed.  Can do as much or little as you're up for - lots to see and do if you wanted to.   We just wanted to be close to the waves and come ""home"" to a wonderful setting to hang out in.   Thank you both!"
44515,20686554,2014-10-04,16573105,Jeremy,"Once in a while, a place turns out to be BETTER than you imagined it would be -- Erika & Blake's cottage was just that.  So many touches of warm hospitality (fresh baked cookies waiting for us!) in a wonderfully charming, clean, bright, and spacious cottage.  Breakfast both mornings was delicious and brought right to our door. Neighborhood was quiet and residential, but we were still just a few minutes away from the ocean. Probably the only place we stayed on our vacation through several cities where we didn't even want to leave the room to go explore.  Highly recommend this cottage -- we'd book it again in a heartbeat."
44515,20809831,2014-10-06,13631532,Susan,"The cottage was beautiful and the hosts are extremely nice and accommodating. it helped our day by having breakfast provided, and it was delicious!  Beautiful spot and very peaceful.  I would definitely recommend to visitors."
44515,20985041,2014-10-09,13411229,Amanprit,"Gorgeous charming beach cottage that we both absolutely loved. The cottage is hidden away at the back of their lovely house and you feel invited inside with the signs leading you to the cottage. Very much let yourself in. The coastal decor and little touches gave a real feel of the place and where you are, right along the Californian Coast. Both of us loved coming back to the cottage at the end of the day. Blake also kindly gave recommendations of where to eat that went down well with us. "
44515,21192787,2014-10-13,1741357,Lara,"The Cottage is absolutely charming.  We loved staying there again, and the little private patio fence around the cottage is a nice addition since our last visit 2 years ago.  Blake and Erika were wonderful hosts, providing a delicious breakfast and even a big sleeping pad for our pooch. "
44515,21373522,2014-10-16,11835728,Jean-Hugues,"WOW...what can we say about this ""place of paradise"" ?! Warm welcome with all the signs to guide us to reach the little cottage in the backyard.  The minute we entered the place, we felt the peaceful ambiance of Pacific Grove.  Was so tidy, well decorated, really equipped with a gas burner stove, fridge, microwave, pots & pans too.  A personnal review of ncie restaurants was provided, and wi-fi info too.  Blake and Erika welcomed us but were really respectful of privacy.  We had the choice of 2 menus for breakfast, which was really good with fresh eggs, fruits, toast and coffee.  We really enjoyed our 2 nights, and wished we had spent some more time in this wonderful area. Almost forgotten the sound of the waves in the nightime.... amazing :)"
44515,21502594,2014-10-19,12739768,Merrin,"Clean, comfortable, and charming would be the three words best describing our stay at the cottage. Upon arrival signs guided us easily to the quiet and cozy backyard cottage. The fenced patio with clean and comfortable patio furniture made us feel at home. The cottage's charming touches like the dutch door and flower pots in the window were a nice greeting. Inside the bright and beachy decor was simple and tasteful. 

All amenities were convenient and thoughtful, especially the homemade chocolate chop cookies (thank you, Erika they were superb!), the easy wifi access, and a list of tasty restaurants in the surrounding area. No need to spend extra money on breakfast. Two hearty and healthy breakfast options were available, which Blake kindly reminded us of. Take advantage of this, you won't be disappointed! 

We would definitely recommend staying here. It's close to the beach and acclaimed restaurants, Blake and Erika are kind, thoughtful, and gracious hosts, and the cottage is clean and cozy. We wish we could've stayed longer. "
44515,21737762,2014-10-23,9307881,Al,"Great neighborhood, close to a spectacular beach, 17 mile drive and the town of Locust Grove.  Hosts were friendly, and the accomodations were as advertised.

Nice breakfast, and the bed was real comfortable.  Neighborhood extremely quiet."
44515,21868643,2014-10-26,5209792,Brad,We had a great time at the cottage.  Everything was better than described...from the herbed eggs at breakfast to the easy signage and noted throughout the house.  It was the perfect way to experience the peninsula!  We will definitely stay here again!!
44515,22060714,2014-10-29,19512842,Hayley,"This lovely cottage was even better than the photos. Such a piece of paradise! We truly loved every moment at Erika and Blake's abode.

The cottage has everything you need- a full kitchen, amazingly comfy king size bed, and an awesome outdoor patio to relax and read. You can even hear the ocean waves when you step outside, and the stars here are really bright. (We live in LA, so don't get much star gazing!)

Oh my gosh, Erika and Blake bring you breakfast every morning!!! Man could I get used to that! It's delicious and organic and such a treat. We felt spoiled :)

The neighborhood is perfect, we had a lot of fun walking our dogs around and checking out Pacific Grove. The beach really is blocks away, and it's gorgeous.

Pacific Grove is a great destination to check out Monterey and Big Sur. We had a wonderful time exploring, and think we need to come back. There is so much to do and see in a few days. We're back in LA now, but I am really envious of life up there. It's not crowded, there are great restaurants near by, the ocean is breathtaking, and the trees!! Oh the trees :) Gorgeous scenery, it felt good for my soul.

Super grateful for Erika and Blake's hospitality. They are friendly but let you do your thing :) We will surely come back!"
44515,22227050,2014-11-02,18410923,Trevor,"We enjoyed our stay in your cosy cottage. 

The breakfasts were always very welcome & delicious (as well as the cookies :-)) and the cottage had all the necessary amenities.
 
Just a short walk to the coast where we saw some magnificent sunsets. 

All in all a worthwhile experience and we strongly recommend this location!"
44515,22356209,2014-11-04,19204359,Jamie,"I could not have asked for a more enjoyable getaway! 

Not only was the cottage just beautiful, comfortable and spotlessly clean but Erika & Blake were the perfect hosts~ their gracious and warm hospitality was so greatly appreciated. Breakfast was just delicious and the bed was luxuriously comfy! Every detail so well thought out~ making our stay easy and delightful, in every way.

I look forward to my next visit & hope to be back, often. Thank you, Erika & Blake!"
44515,22453327,2014-11-07,2261665,Nancy,"I enjoyed a very pleasant two nights in Blake and Erika's lovely cottage. The setting was idyllic, the bed comfortable, and the breakfasts were delicious. I particularly appreciated being able to bring my dog with me.  She and I enjoyed the short walk to the ocean and the pathway that was easy to traverse along the beach/rocks. I had never been to PG before, but I think I will be back. Thanks for a great stay!"
44515,22519720,2014-11-09,11165935,Lynna,"Can't say enough wonderful things about my stay at the cottage. The location is close to the beach, and the cottage is super charming, clean and cozy. (I wish I could've stayed longer!) Communication with Erika and Blake along with any check-in / check-out instructions were easy. The cherry on top is that they offer breakfast in the morning and cookies upon arrival. Thanks for sharing your cottage, Erika and Blake!"
44515,22645028,2014-11-11,12220559,Cathy,"I was very excited for this trip to this area, and this cottage in Pacific Grove did not disappoint.  It was dark when we arrived, but we were able to follow the cute and clear wooden signs from the street back to the cottage behind the main house.  There were fresh chocolate chip cookies and a warm welcome note waiting for us upon our arrival.  Blake and Erika were always responsive and available for anything we needed.  The cottage is cozy and comfortable and has just about every amenity that we could have needed.  There is a small full kitchenette with both stove top and small oven, microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, and mini fridge.  We cooked some fresh pasta from Luca's in Carmel the first night and had the basics that we needed to make a nice meal.  It was great to have that option.  Erika and Blake have stocked the bath room with shower toiletries, plenty of towels, and a hair dryer.  The king sized bed itself was incredibly comfortable and the TV could be seen from most places in the cottage which was nice.  There is cable, and wifi in the cottage itself.  We brought our laptop and an hdmi cord and were able to stream netflix to the television.   We loved the herb cooked eggs and yogurt and granola that they served us in the morning.  Breakfast service was a nice touch, and above and beyond most of my other air bnb experiences.  We had a wonderful weekend exploring Pacific Grove, Monterey, Carmel, and Big Sur. The cottage was the perfect location to easily explore all of these places."
44515,22707916,2014-11-12,1291756,Maya,I already left a glowing review for Erica and Blake. Their cottage is a dream and a vacation spot you do not wish to miss! You'd really appreciate such wonderful hosts.
44515,22740435,2014-11-13,1291756,Maya,"Heavenly! (No religious connotations here :) 

Erica was amazing in helping with the reservation that required some help from Airbnb due to the software limitations. It all worked out great, and Erica was incredibly helpful and attentive. The cottage is just lovely, like the hosts."
44515,22883273,2014-11-17,20019342,Brian,"Everything we read about this lovely retreat was accurate!The private cottage was clean, and well appointed with a private sitting area outside for us and our dog Coby! This is a wonderfully well situated spot to explore the beautiful Monterey peninsula , either on foot(just blocks to the beach and bike paths), or in your car(right at the start of the 17 mile drive). This property is gorgeous and the hosts(with their beautiful new baby girl) were very warm and helpful! We hope to return!

"
44515,23093937,2014-11-23,1225765,Rob,Yet another fantastic visit! This has to be our favorite place on Airbnb. =)
44515,23255001,2014-11-26,2622939,Vladimir,"This place exceeded our expectations! You can expect a clean place, quiet neighborhood and tasty breakfast. Highlights are short walk to the beach and sky covered in stars at night. I would gladly stop here again."
44515,23319050,2014-11-29,2797661,Jamee,"The hosts were super responsive and lovely. The cottage was amazing! It is a very private cottage located behind the hosts home, but it feels as though you have your own space. It is in a nice quiet neighborhood only a a couple of blocks from the beach. And with the provided light breakfast with delicious coffee, I totally felt relaxed and wee bit (ok a lot) decadent. 

I loved this place and will return as soon as I can! I highly recommend this cottage."
44515,23432188,2014-12-01,21783298,Mindy,"I think the ""cottage"" has ruined us forever for our first Airbnb experience. It was BEYOND all expectations. The pictures just touch on the comfort and spaciousness (2 adults and a Great Dane) of this cottage. All previous reviews are accurate and hard to add to. We have been coming to Monterey the exact same weekend for 14 years and bravely chose a different location. We enjoyed a very short walk to the beach each morning, even amid a light rain. It was centrally located to Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel. When we wanted to relax, it has the features and comfort of being at home. The dutch door was nice to crack open for fresh air, and to hear the rain coming through the trees landing on the brick patio. There is a small room heater, which worked perfectly to remove any chill, and many windows that can be opened for fresh air. The king-size bed is like a cloud, you just sink in it. I have a bad back, yet never felt it during my stay. The bathroom was amply supplied (even with a few items stashed in a bottom drawer  that may be needed if you forgot to pack). The kitchenette ALMOST made me want to prepare our own meal (Maybe next time). We enjoyed fresh scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, toast and vanilla yogurt with granola delivered to us each morning at our requested time by the host. We forgot there was anyone else living nearby. We have already booked our next stay for next year and are counting down the days. Suggestion: Bring slippers, as you may drag sand in from the walks (parque flooring).  Nice size refrigerator can handle many snacks, drinks, etc. "
44515,23527968,2014-12-03,15871831,George,We just recently stayed at Erika and Blake's cottage.  The home was very convenient to the Pacific Grove beach area for walks and was very private.  Noise was no an issue.  The cottage was a lovely stay.  Blake was very responsive to issues that came up and resolved them promptly.  We enjoyed our morning fresh egg breakfast.  Thank you
44515,23625523,2014-12-07,21467147,Suzy,"WOW! We travel to Pacific Grove for a conference every December and  are SO glad we found this place via airbnb. It is beautifully decorated and clean. The outside seating area is lovely and Erika provided us with a vegan, gluten free breakfast AND surprised us with GF, vegan cookies the day we left. 

Lastly, Erika was VERY prompt in returning any emails we sent with questions!

We left considering a trip back in the spring or summer. If we do, we will definitely be staying here!
"
44515,24320310,2014-12-26,19513787,Victor,Wish I could provide 6 stars.  The cottage was wonderful and filled with everything we could have wanted.  The breakfasts divine - I have even ordered the same brand of coffee that Erika and Blake provided each morning for my own home.  We loved the brand new bathroom renovation - it matches the rest of the high quality finishes in the cottage.  A great place to stay with gracious hosts.  We look forward to visiting again. 
44515,24519521,2014-12-30,4463858,Jill And Jon,We really enjoyed our visit with Erika and Blake in beautiful Pacific Grove. They have made a perfect sanctuary with a beautiful  outside patio. The cottage was cozy and tastefully decorated. We so appreciated that it was dog friendly. We hope to return.

The cottage is the perfect size for us and our fur kids we look forward to our next visit. "
44515,25201164,2015-01-09,18679291,Olivia,"Thank you Erika and Blake for a superb stay in your comfy cottage. Breakfasts were delicious, the beach (5 min away) was breathtaking, and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. I found both Erika and Blake to be responsive, friendly, and helpful but also respectful of mine and my partner's desire for a private romantic getaway. 
We were planning to arrive at 3, as per the stated arrival time, but were delayed for several hours by car trouble. Erika and Blake were flexible and accommodating, and the signs they put out to guide us through parking and finding the cottage behind their house were very clear and easy to follow. They leave a list of restaurant suggestions, and the one we tried was - as described - delicious. 
Overall we had a wonderful time on our vacation and are looking forward to making it an annual adventure - hopefully including a stay in this sweet cottage by the sea."
44515,25263343,2015-01-11,110572,Peggy,"Erika & Blake's cottage could not be more perfect -- private, quiet, well-appointed, comfortable, everything you need for a relaxing getaway. I cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough. I go to Pacific Grove several times a year & can hardly wait to stay here again. Thank you, Erika & Blake for creating such a perfect space. "
44515,25382082,2015-01-14,2600513,Scott,"Booked two nights for my parents as a Xmas present and they had a wonderful time. Great communication, convenient location, everything as good or better than advertised on the site. Highly recommend!"

44515,25491608,2015-01-18,4168982,Tom,"We have stayed here a number of times and always really enjoy ourselves.  The place is clean, private, and easily accessed.  Its close to everything!"
44515,25735597,2015-01-25,12836653,Gloria,"Blake was a terrific host.  He was their to greet us, and welcome us to their cottage.  The space was amazing nice seating area outside the cottage, inside modern cottage interior that had plenty of space to just chill, a great kitchen, and large bathroom.  The breakfast delivered each morning, had us thinking we should move in!  Nice quiet neighborhood.  Walking distance to Asilomar Conference Center which we was the purpose of the visit.  Great way to begin and end the day with a lovely walks after a day of meetings.  The icing on the cake was their cute doggies.  Would go back in a heartbeat."
44515,25844662,2015-01-27,7988878,Lauren,"I booked this trip to Pacific Grove for my parents. They loved it! Ithe cottage was easy to find, super cute, close to the waves crashing and an easy drive to Carmel and Big Sur. They loved receiving breakfast to their door in the morning and the very private set up. I'd like to come visit myself!"
44515,26041632,2015-02-02,10214350,Carol,"Erika and Blake's place is almost like something out of a child's book like ""my secret garden"". It is so adorable. The outside sitting area is so private with comfortable  places to sit. There is a fire pit which Blake was kind enough to give me wood for and help me with the fire. Pacific Grove is so beautiful. One can walk to the beach or drive and park at many places. I would've been happy to sit on a bench and gaze at the ocean for hours. Thank you Blake and Erika for hosting me. "
44515,26291932,2015-02-09,5490511,Lisa,"This quiet studio cottage is nicely appointed and as described in the listing. In a beautiful setting within walking distance of the beach and town. Use of natural cleaning products (no artificial scents) and breakfast are much appreciated.  We did not get to use the patio due to rain, but a private and idyllic place to relax.  The bed was softer than our preference and my husband, who is 6'2"", found it a little short.  Overall, a wonderful place to stay in Pacific Grove.  "
44515,27243277,2015-03-01,21049139,Laura,"Perfect quiet location near beaches and restaurants. Lovely garden cottage. We, and our little dogs, loved it."
44515,27424020,2015-03-04,15449505,Hope,"This was place was beyond special. I was in P.G. for a very meaningful family matter and this place made my stay feel warm and cared for. It is so peaceful here. You have your own courtyard with table and chairs, the hosts bring breakfast to you, the cottage interior is attractively furnished, you are walking distance the beach and there is everything one might need for a short term stay. Entering the place I felt like I was entering my own private fairy tale. I look forward to returning in the future!"
44515,27570251,2015-03-08,7344865,Kelsey,Beautiful little cottage in a surreal setting. Erika and Blake are the most gracious hosts. The cottage was clean and exactly as described. The bed was so comfortable it made it hard to leave. We wouldn't stay anywhere else if we return to the area. 
44515,27712360,2015-03-10,6243159,Robin,"This was my second stay at the cottage and just as fabulous & wonderful as the first time. 
Erika & Blake are incredible hosts, very caring and welcoming. They do it right, from the beautiful decor, comfortable bed, peaceful garden atmosphere (with the sound of the ocean in the background) to the delicious breakfast. I will definitely be coming back again."
44515,27792423,2015-03-12,25087026,Joseph,"We arrived after dark and I suspect we woke baby Millie with the ringing of the doorbell of the main residence, but we were made most welcome by Erika as she escorted us to our 'home'.
The ambiance was great, the furniture and fittings classy and we felt very comfortable if somewhat tired after a long drive from LA.
We met Blake the next morning when he delivered our tasty breakfast."
44515,27913935,2015-03-15,12304009,Jackie,"Not enough can be said about this place. I was blown away with the cottage and hospitality. My husband and I, with our little dog, spent the weekend there. It was one of the most wonderful and relaxing weekends ever. Five minute walk to the ocean, and near everything in town. Erika makes an amazing breakfast and the coffee is awesome. We will be back, already trying to plan another trip. "
44515,28296782,2015-03-22,4395572,Elodie,"We came 2 years ago IN erika and Blake house, it's so nice and charming that we decided to come again this year. It's still perfect, quiet and charming. The lodge is beautiful and the area perfect to enjoy California "
44515,28982203,2015-04-02,14819039,Denise,We had a wonderful stay at Erika and Blakes lovely cottage.  It is in a very nice area of Pacific Grove and the property is beautiful.  Very quaint and charming.  The cottage is very clean and the decor is lovely.  It was very windy and chilly and we did not get to take advantage of being so close to the beach.  We would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the Monterey area.  The breakfast is a great start to the day and the coffee was excellent.  I have no doubt we will stay there again the next time we get a chance to go back!  Thanks so much Erika and Blake!  I almost forgot to mention that the bed is soooo comfortable! :)
44515,29090960,2015-04-04,12052718,Jeff,"We enjoyed a wonderful, relaxing stay at Erika and Blake's charming cottage. The entire property is beautiful and located in a quiet neighborhood in Pacific Grove. We loved being steps away from the beach. We brought our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with us, so we took him there for his walks. The sites we wanted to see in Monterey and Carmel were just a short drive away. The location was excellent!

Erika and Blake were fabulous hosts. They were always friendly and kindly offered suggestions for places to eat and things to do. Not to mention the delicious breakfast and coffee they provided in the morning! 

The cottage is so clean and decorated perfectly. Erika and Blake really thought of every detail and we are so thankful for their hospitality!  We would proudly recommend this rental to any friends or family for their visit to Monterey/Carmel. We can't wait to visit again in the near future! You (and your pets!) will enjoy this lovely cottage."

I can't say enough about the adorableness of this place, the location and the attentiveness and flexibility of our hosts!  We love staying here, it feels like a dream, even when it rains, it's magical.  Erika and Blake are very accommodating and provide a wonderful space, clean, efficient, and with eye candy in every direction!  Walk to the beach, ride your bikes to the aquarium, eat your dinner on the patio and watch the woodpeckers nesting in the towering pines.  They have updated the bathroom very nicely with fantastic tiling and a great vanity.  Thank you for another magical vacation!"

They were friendly but gave us complete privacy.  The listing was very accurate.  Our private patio even surpassed our expectation.  The cottage is cozy and romantic.  It is the perfect neighborhood to stay in in Pacific Grove -- very quiet, pretty, close to the beach.  It was like coming home at the end of the day, so much nicer than staying at a hotel."
44515,30746408,2015-04-26,116319,Tasha,We had a wonderful stay. The cottage is comfortable and cozy with all the amenities needed. I didn't realize they even make breakfast and deliver it to your door. That was a real treat! Would stay here again next time we're in town.
44515,31249711,2015-05-03,12126605,Blake,"Blake and Erika's cottage was wonderful.  It was exactly as described and impossibly lovely.  It was a very, very quiet location, the yard is extremely beautiful, we felt we had complete privacy.  We couldn't have enjoyed our time their more.  There were many thoughtful touches that made us feel completely at home, from the offer to prepare us breakfast, to the fresh cookies waiting for us when we got there (and the fresh cookies left with our car on the day we left!).  They provided a list of favorite local restaurants, wifi passwords, instructions for everything in the cottage. 

A five minute walk from the beach, a five minute drive from downtown, you can't beat this place.

Although we didn't get a chance to meet Blake and Erika, they were extremely responsive through email and had really thought of everything.  They were extremely kind and hospitable.  

Just bring some cheese and champagne to put in the fridge and someone you love and you can really make some cherished memories at this place.  We really can't wait to go back . Thanks, Blake and Erika, for everything!

"
44515,31499133,2015-05-05,9129746,Sasha,So great! Perfect little guest house. I want to live there! And breakfast in the morning and treats when you arrive. We had a wonderful time and can't wait to go back and bring our pup along again!

Located a short stroll from a stunning beach front walkway which was perfect for morning runs/walks and a short drive to Monterey. Myself and my sister had a really lovely time here. Would highly recommended Erika and Blake's cottage. Also very easy communication.

We had an amazing stay here. The cottage is just as in the pictures - a wonderful space and very clean. Erika is the most thoughtful host - there were cookies on arrival, breakfast supplies in the fridge, fresh cut flowers on the nightstands. It was a treat to stay here! Additionally, communication with Erika & Blake was very smooth - they were super responsive and helpful. This cottage is most deserving of its 5-star rating. Thanks Erika & Blake!"
44515,49201329,2015-10-02,28424526,Gary,"Thanks Erika and Blake for a wonderful stay.  Your home was exactly as displayed online and was a great place to stay during our San Diego to San Fransisco road trip.  The wine, treats and breakfast were all a wonderful touch and very much appreciated.  We both slept as if we were in our own beds at home and found the location central to everything that we planned in your area.   We would highly recomend staying to anyone considering your area.   "

Erika and Blake were very accommodating. Uber easily found us and took us to Cannery Row for about 9$. The trip back was the same. Very comfortable bed, kitchenette well prepped, clean bathroom with everything a five star hotel would provide. I hope I can stay here again the next time I plan a trip to Monterey/Pebble Beach."
44515,49809589,2015-10-06,12674535,Melissa,"My husband and I recently stayed in this charming and beautifully decorated cottage. We arrived at the cottage late in the evening after a long day of travel to find cookies, wine, and a note welcoming us. They were great hosts, even though we never actually met in person. They were quick to reply to any questions we had prior to our trip and upon arrival. 

We highly recommend this cottage. If we ever make it back to this part of the country we will definitely try to stay here again. "
44515,50102333,2015-10-09,9189039,Christina,"My husband and I LOVED our stay at the cottage! Everything far exceeded our expectations! The cottage is even cuter than the pictures describe (and of course very clean). It is the perfect size for two people. There is a little kitchenette that is fully functional as well as a coffee maker, tea kettle, microwave, etc. Erika and Blake are such gracious hosts! While we didn't get to meet them in person, their instructions were very clear, and we did not have any trouble with anything during our stay. Erika provided us with some wine and breakfast items in the fridge when we arrived, which was so nice of her. She even accommodated my gluten free needs and baked me homemade gluten free cookies, which tasted amazing!! I appreciated the personal touches. The cottage is very private, and we felt completely safe in the neighborhood. We enjoyed wine on the private patio one night - the whole ambience is very relaxing! The location of the house is also perfect - just a short drive to Monterey and Carmel. It is very central. We also made the short walk from the cottage to the beach (5 min) one night to watch the sunset. Our stay could not have been more perfect! We were so sad to leave this wonderful oasis and hopefully will return soon!! Thank you for an excellent stay!"

The cottage was exactly as pictured & having the ability to make coffee & have a light breakfast that was provided by the host was perfect. Our every need was taken care of & we actually hope to be back with our pup next time around!

44515,52685570,2015-11-01,1225765,Rob,"Yet another wonderful visit to this quiet, private cottage in Pacific Grove, which has become a staple weekend retreat for my wife and I. As always, a comfortable, relaxing weekend with lovely little breakfast surprises from our hosts. We can't wait to visit again."
44515,53106572,2015-11-05,7902935,Richard & Stephanie,"Our host Erika was totally on top of communication with us as guests. She was very quick to respond to our questions regarding pet sitting, bike trails, beach weather, and most accommodating to our various requests. We felt very welcome to our visit . She even went the extra mile in compensating for some construction work being done about their very lovely estate. The main home sits amid an older , quiet neighborhood with narrow winding streets. Built in 1929 it is magnificent and complimented with many well manicured established trees and landscaping, brickwork and statuary.
   The guest cottage is partitioned off with old stained glass windows set in the fencing walls. Quite accommodating to one's needs. So many amenities.  We made use of the  kitchenette area, sat in the garden patio for our hors 'd oeuvres & wine followed by some delicious fresh seafood obtained at the Monterey wharf. The bed is so soft with its fluffy pillow-top mattress - like floating on a cloud. Erika even had a welcome treat awaiting us as well as staples for breakfast in the refrigerator. Very classsy!   The cottage is also pet-friendly which was our goal when seeking out this place.
In all, any guest should be happy to be able to stay with Erika and Blake in their lovely little guest cottage and we would certainly love to stay here again.
"
44515,53744430,2015-11-12,5469168,Linda,"Erika and Blake were the perfect hosts, available by phone if we needed anything yet at the same time we felt that we had our privacy.  It is really a cottage by the sea.  We would get up every morning with our dog and walk down to the ocean.  We sat on the patio at the end of the day, had a glass of wine and listened to the crashing of the waves.  The cottage had just the right amount of sleeping and sitting space and was very cozy and warm at night.  We arrived very late in the dark so we were pleasantly surprised in the morning to see beautiful stained glass windows all around, the sun streaming in thru the windows and being tucked into what seemed more like a private compound than the typical rental property.  The cottage itself had just the perfect amount of amenities, a delicious array of breakfast items and a wonderful bottle of Pinot.  We can't wait to come back.  Thank you Erika and Blake.  "
44515,54339045,2015-11-18,48157234,Chapman,"10/10! We couldn't imagine a better first experience through Airbnb. Erika and Blake were tremendous hosts. We were welcomed with fresh baked cookies and wine. The cottage was clean, private and in a wonderful location. We will be using Airbnb for all of our next travel adventures. We hope all our future Airbnb experiences are as wonderful as this! "
44515,54837850,2015-11-25,20694049,Ariz,"We had such a great experience at this beautiful cottage. Erika was so attentive and you can tell it is very important for them to have happy guests. We absolutely loved everything about it. From the beautiful decor, to the location, and the most delicious ingredients to make yogurt parfaits in the morning. Oh! And the cookies!! So soft and addictive! We felt so welcome, and would wish all our Airbnb experiences were like this. Thanks Erika & Blake for sharing your gorgeous home with us."

44515,54971700,2015-11-27,4607123,Rachel And Lawford,Wow what can we say other than what an incredible cottage and property. The photos really don't do it justice on how cute this place was!! We absolutely loved every minute of our stay and look forward to coming back in the future! Everything was very clean and comfortable. It felt like home away from home. Blake & Erika were both super friendly in person and were accommodating to all of our needs. 
44515,55338918,2015-12-01,21783298,Mindy,"This was our 2nd stay at the cottage and we were just as pleased as we were the first time. Erika notified us in advance of the delay of their main home remodel/construction, which turned out to be no inconvenience at all. In fact, after hearing about a possible wi-fi/internet issue, the contractor checked in with us (with permission) and let us know to contact him if anything arises. 
After entering the property through a fairy-tale like gate, signs direct you to the cottage, which is separated from the main house by a bricked courtyard, trees and a windowed plaster wall. The cottage itself has its own front courtyard with a dutch front door. Chilly in the winter, but warmed quickly with the small space heater, enough so that you can open windows to keep fresh air flowing. The kitchenette has supplies to make a simple meal, including a stove, microwave, toaster and serving ware. 
Being a 2-short block walk from the shore was convenient for morning walks with our Great Dane, who was also welcome at the cottage. A short walk north up the shore leads to a large beach area where humans and their dogs can stroll and/or watch the surfers on the huge waves. The neighborhood is quiet and quant. The cottage is an 8-20 minute drive from downtown Monterey, the wharf, Cannary Row, Pacific Grove and Carmel. There is also a huge beach in Carmel that the dogs can play. 
We arrived to fresh baked cookies and a bottle of wine. Due to the host being offsite from her remodel, she stocked the mini-fridge with homemade yogurt and granola, bread and butter and fresh fruit. Quite delicious! We cannot say enough about how much we love our stay at the cottage and have already booked our 3rd stay for next year. 
"
44515,55889724,2015-12-07,4387691,Meribe,"All of the positive reviews for this lovely property are 100% accurate and on point.  My husband, two dogs and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Erika & Blake's charming cottage and plan to make a return visit!"
44515,56168414,2015-12-09,31547751,Doreen,What a wonderful place in Pacific Grove!  It lived up to all our expectations.  
44515,56360868,2015-12-13,399742,Marion,"Erika makes you feel very welcome. Upon arrival we had fresh bread, butter and cereal, milk and coffee. The bed is amazing. The area is stunning and just a few minutes to the ocean. Lovely shower and fluffy towels, everything very nice. Really recommend it. "
44515,56608851,2015-12-15,27471402,Andrea,"We had a great time staying at this little gem.  They had great food waiting for us as well as a bottle of wine.  They had construction going on, but it didn't interfere at all.  They were very communicative and were just a text away if we needed anything.  We loved staying there!"
44515,56771421,2015-12-18,20416095,Sandie,"We just spent three days at Erika and Blake's lovely cottage. It was absolutely perfect in every way. Not only did we enjoy it, but our Whippet, Shadow, loved it too. We highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Monterey Bay area. We look forward to coming back again.
"
44515,57116157,2015-12-22,23210128,Lauren,Erika was an excellent host providing special treats for our stay.  The cottage was very cute and well situated in Pacific Grove near Asilomar and gorgeous coastline.  
44515,57420868,2015-12-26,12481130,Paul,"Great place.  Very reasonably priced. Charming inside with wonderful extensive outdoor grounds, all fenced in so perfect for our dog.  

Not overly large, but sufficient.  Easy parking."
44515,57672254,2015-12-28,19650550,Kayla,"Erika & Blake's little cottage by the sea was even better than expected. It's warm, inviting, and we were pleasantly greeted by nice bottle of wine and some chocolate chip cookies. We met with Blake when we arrived, and he apologized for the renovation going on in the main house, but honestly, it wasn't even a problem. This place is perfect for a nice getaway, and we made sure to take advantage of the restaurant recommendations (Red House Cafe was everything they described and more). 

While the cottage is only a few yards away from the main house, the cottage is very private. It's only a block away from the beach and the neighborhood is quiet. The price is just right, and we look forward to visiting again. For our first venture into airbnb, this was a great experience. "
44515,57864266,2015-12-30,2817300,Giulianni,"My boyfriend and I were impressed from the very first step we took into the cottage. The nautical decor is charming, the bed is very soft, and the structure is well insulated. The space heater warmed up the entire cottage within 10 minutes and there was absolutely no noise from the street, which made for two quiet and cozy nights. The highlight of our stay, however, was Asilomar beach. The view of the bay at sunset was glorious and it was such a short walk we went twice. I'm not sure how anyone would not enjoy their stay. "
44515,58260177,2016-01-02,88533,Dominique,"Erika and Blake's cottage was one of our first Airbnb stays (way back in 2011) and has become our favorite annual retreat!

Their cottage is perfectly located on a quiet block in Pacific Grove, a short walk from the beach and a short drive from all the happenings in downtown Pacific Grove / Monterey. 

The hosts are incredibly thoughtful - we had loads of provisions for a continental breakfast every morning and delicious fruit and cookies for snacks. The bathroom is fully stocked with all natural bath products.  Best of all we've been able to bring our two dogs each time (always asking permission first of course) and I think they love being here even more than we do :)

Thanks so much Erika and Blake!"
44515,58769584,2016-01-05,28312781,Andrea,What a wonderful cottage. We had a fabulous time. I can't thank Erika and Blake enough. They were super accommodating and the cottage was super well kept and in an awesome location. We hope to plan our next get away soon. 
44515,59211821,2016-01-08,16548820,Rebecca,"We had such a great time at Erika and Blake's cottage. When we arrived we were greeted by some delicious wine and chocolate chip cookies. The cottage was very comfortable which included an extremely comfortable bed, well stocked kitchen, and beautiful bathroom. Despite the stormy weather, we were able to enjoy Asilomar (a 5 min walk away) and other local spots. Overall, we loved our vacation and can't wait to return :-)"
44515,59419718,2016-01-10,15064162,Quentin,"Had a great stay in the cottage! Convenient, quiet, and nicely appointed."
44515,59686847,2016-01-14,40202975,Katelyn And Dante,"Erika and Blake are wonderful, hospitable people and their cottage is adorable!  My husband and I spent the last part of our honeymoon here, and it couldn't have been more perfect.  Erika and Blake were more than accommodating when we asked for an accommodation in our plans, and made us feel welcome and comfortable in their home.  They even left us a delish bottle of wine and some cookies for our arrival, as well as coffee and breakfast food for the mornings we were there.  We were so impressed that this lovely couple thought of everything we might need in order to enjoy our stay.  They really go the extra mile! 

The place itself is totally clean, comfortable and private, and even has it's own courtyard with outdoor seating.  The bathroom is spotless and updated, the bed is a dream come true, and the little kitchenette is perfect for whipping up a quick meal.  The town of Pacific Grove has incredible ocean views and is minutes away from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, 17 Mile Drive, and the quaint town of Carmel (we recommend all!).   

My only regret was that I didn't get to meet Erika face to face (entirely my fault).  That being said, if you're someone who doesn't like saying ""hi"" to awesome people, Erika and Blake seem to accommodate this lol.  

Our trip was amazing and we would happily stay here again! THANK YOU to the moon and back to Erika and Blake for hosting us and making our stay so wonderful!"
44515,59991459,2016-01-18,4168982,Tom,We love staying at the cottage.  That is why we keep coming back!  Thanks for letting us stay with you again.
44515,60449442,2016-01-24,21555285,Pamela,We loved our five days here!  Sweet cottage in a perfect location.
44515,60791776,2016-01-27,55074117,Benji,Cool little spot!  Close enough to walk to the beach and far enough from the bustle of downtown.  A great get away spot for sure.
44515,61207893,2016-02-01,53742081,Erin Lucas,The cottage was exactly as the pictures looked and it was exceptionally clean. 
44515,62139995,2016-02-12,25800811,Patrick,"We had such a comfortable stay.  The bed was cozy and the bathroom roomy.  Erika & Blake made us feel welcome with the breakfast items and cookies upon our arrival.  Even though the cottage is in the back yard of the house, it was still very private making for a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.  "
44515,62471400,2016-02-14,58270667,Jonathan,"This place is AWESOME! It was perfect for our weekend getaway. The  cottage was beautiful both inside and out. Everything was in great condition and very comfortable, especially the bed. Furthermore, we enjoyed the provided breakfast and the coffee was spot on! All in all, being walking distance from the beach and being located so closely to so many great restaurants sealed the deal. I can only hope that if we visit Pacific Grove again, this place is available!"
44515,62785207,2016-02-16,57554443,Vance,"I can't say enough positive things about this airbnb and Blake and Erika as hosts.  Blake met us upon check in to orient us and made us feel very welcome.  A great bottle of Cab Franc and fresh chocolate chip cookies were even waiting inside.  What a lovely surprise!  The cottage is a fair distance from the main house and completely private.  The decor is beautiful and there are so many tasteful extras like gourmet French Roast coffee, cream, Dave's 21 seed bread, butter, jam, vanilla yogurt, gourmet granola, pears and tangerines.  The kitchenette is outfitted with everything one could need.  The property is close to the Asilomar beach and centrally located between Carmel and Pacific Grove.  This was our first Airbnb experience and we are so pleased with the outcome!"
44515,63153942,2016-02-21,38474979,Melissa,"Erika and Blake have created such a special place! There was a bottle of wine and cookies waiting for us (and breakfast in the fridge). It was a wonderful way to kick off our much needed vacation. The cottage is incredible - homey, inviting, quiet, and private. It felt like we were at home. I will recommend this place to anyone going to Monterey and will come back just to stay here. 

Thank you, Erika and Blake for opening up your property to our family (we have a little 10 month old that joined us) and making our first family vacation one for the books! "
44515,63535971,2016-02-24,42637496,Elizabeth,The cottage was at the back of the main house but was very private and also had a private courtyard which we used. It was very comfortable with all amenities. Very comfortable bed. Great location on the point and wonderful walk around the coast nearby.
44515,64192736,2016-03-01,35999600,Mark,"Erika & Blake were outstanding hosts.  They had everything noted in the listing ready for us before we arrived.  The little cottage was as advertised, clean, well maintained, and charming.  We usually have over 75 nights at hotels during the year, and their bed was one of the most comfortable. 

What can someone say about the area of and around Pacific Grove.  It is one of the most beautiful areas in the world.  Staying in Pacific Grove allows someone to visit many sites from Big Sur to Palo Alto, from Carmel to Salinas. As for the town of Pacific Grove, we found it very charming and friendly.  We enjoyed dinner in a great Italian restaurant in the middle of town.

This was our very first booking with Airbnb, and we must say it was a very positive experience."
44515,64585194,2016-03-06,40252,Diana,"We had a wonderful time at Erika & Blake's cottage! The cottage is located behind the main house, yet is private and quiet. Clean, comfy and well-equipped. Erika was very friendly and responsive via email. 

The breakfast items were such a treat! Organic yogurt, granola, toast and jam. So thoughtful! 

Would def recommend staying here!
"
44515,65001473,2016-03-10,13323316,Judy,Erika and Blake are very friendly hosts but give guests privacy. The cottage located behind the main house and is very cozy and comfortable. Erika and Blake are very responsive to any needs that may come up. The location is perfect - walking distance to Asilomar State Beach and a short drive to restaurants and shops in downtown Pacific Grove. The private courtyard is relaxing and quiet - a perfect place to sit and read or just enjoy the birdsong. Everything in the cottage was as advertised and more. Our dog was in heaven with his daily walks on the beach.  We would definitely return to this lovely spot.
44515,65331884,2016-03-13,17977718,Amanda,"What a lovely spot! Erika and Blake's cottage is perfect for a romantic getaway. The extra touches they offer make this listing really stand out - delicious local food like organic coffee, yogurt and granola are provided, the huge bed is super soft with lots of pillows, the small but functional kitchenette is equipped with all the tools I imagine anyone would wish for. 
Our hosts made us feel very welcome and went out of their way to accommodate us. We ordered pizza our first night, and although we told the driver not to, he rang the bell on the main house instead of calling us to come out front and get it. Blake was kind enough to sign for it and bring the pizza back to us! 
It was a bit tight for the two of us plus a baby and two dogs, but we loved our stay here and would definitely come back!"
44515,65766015,2016-03-17,40208272,Roger, The cottage was quiet and peaceful with only the sounds of the birds and the surf.  Everything we needed was there to make our 3 night stay what we had wished for.   
44515,65936977,2016-03-18,41945760,Kelly,"Erika & Blake gave us excellent instructions for our late arrival and made us feel right at home. Their beautiful yard and cottage was the perfect getaway for my husband and I, plus our 2 small dogs.  The attention to detail was so wonderful; from the Pier 1 favorites to the special treats they left for us it was like a mini vacation in our vacation. Everything was so nice and we are hoping to come back someday. Both Blake and Erika made sure that they greeted us between our coming and going to make sure that we had everything we needed. They are such wonderful hosts."
44515,66179505,2016-03-20,2309166,Anne,Great place. Host made us feel welcome. A couple blocks away from the ocean. You can hear the waves. Bed was so comfortable. We were able to bring our 2 dogs thete. We would stay there again.
44515,66357903,2016-03-22,48532528,Allyson,"My husband and I stayed in beautiful Pacific Grove for 2 nights on a road trip up the Pacific Coast Highway.  Erika & Blake's cottage was the perfect place to call home while we were away.  The cottage itself was impeccably clean, cozy and provided all of the amenities (and then some!) that we could've hoped for.  Erika & Blake greeted us warmly and made it seem like we were staying with old friends.  The breakfast tray and anniversary wine were such thoughtful touches.  We would definitely recommend anyone traveling through the area to stay with Erika & Blake!"
44515,66867066,2016-03-25,421027,Nadja,"Great little cottage, quite and beautifull surroundings, very stylish and practical. Three minutes walk to the ocean. First day breakfast in the fridge and fruites was a pleasant surprise. We enjoyed our three days stay very much. Highly reccomended for a couples. Thank you Erika."
44515,67253010,2016-03-27,62824338,Aynsley,My boyfriend and I stayed at Erika and Blake's adorable cottage for a quick getaway weekend. The cottage was absolutely adorable and equipped with everything we needed and more! The breakfast goodies were probably the most appreciated. They are located in a wonderful area and we were never more than 20 minutes from anything we wanted to do. We hiked for four hours through Point Lobos and had a great lunch in Carmel! Finished off the trip at the aquarium and Cannery Row. I most definitely see this little spot being somewhere we enjoy coming for back to. We had a phenomenal experience! 
44515,67815274,2016-03-31,8189888,Michelle,"We had another fantastic spring break at this magical cottage!  I can't rave about it enough.  It suits our needs perfectly, is the most adorable little place, and our kids love it too.  We love walking to the beach, going to the aquarium, enjoying the courtyard, and sleeping in, in that huge cozy bed.  The hosts are always welcoming and helpful, but allow us our space.  We are already looking forward to next year!"
44515,68842429,2016-04-07,45012562,Dan,"Fabulous stay!  Erika & Blake are great congenial hosts and their cottage is clean, quiet, secluded and comfortable.   The enclosed yard/patio was a great place for our dogs to hang out.   The close proximity to the beach (two blocks) was additional vacation therapy!   We look forward to staying there again!"
44515,69058738,2016-04-09,39187731,Jay,"We stayed at Erika & Blake's for our elopement/mini vacation for 4 days/3 nights.
The instructions to get to their home was easy to follow. It's in a fantastic location: in a quiet neighborhood, close to good restaurants, and a short drive to Monterey. Also, only about an hour to Big Sur.
When we got inside, everything we needed (from wifi to how the heater works, etc.) was well labelled. The cottage was well maintained and clean. It was the perfect size for two people. The bed was immensely comfortable. The breakfast was delicious. Erika and Blake are so friendly. We don't have anything bad to say!
We truly appreciated being able to stay here. It was such a relaxing getaway."
44515,70203031,2016-04-17,12320235,Nancy And Chuck,This was our 2nd time staying in this quaint little cottage and again it was very comfortable and met all our needs.  We look forward to visiting Blake and Erika's cottage every time we want to visit the area.
44515,71773483,2016-04-28,8203073,Ashlyn,The cutest cottage in the cutest town! The house was perfect with a great location and lots of character. Incredible experience! We're still dreaming of cookies they provide upon arrival. 
44515,72169671,2016-05-01,25132607,Elizabeth,"This place was quite lovely and very serene - exactly as described. Loved the nice little perks, like the breakfast and cookies. The location in PG is great, about a 5 minute peaceful walk to the beach. We also loved being able to come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. We had such a great time here. We would definitely return! FYI, the bed is really soft. "
44515,72614077,2016-05-03,172037,Nicholas,"Erika and Blake were wonderful hosts. The cottage is charming and cozy, you'll certainly fall in love and want to stay forever. It's nestled at the back of the property and is very private and quiet. The location is perfect. A quick walk to the beach and a short drive to restaurants and Monterey. Pacific Grove is a charming town and you won't want to leave. I arrived to fresh baked cookies that were delicious and a tray of breakfast goods in the refrigerator. I got to meet both Erika and Blake (at separate times) and they were lovely to talk to, and very accommodating. I can't say enough great things about my short stay here. It was a wonderful experience and my only negative is I didn't stay longer."
44515,72932065,2016-05-05,19737638,Aiden,What an amazing place.  This guesthouse is located in the back of a BEAUTIFUL property and is perfect in its own right.  It's even nicer than in pictures.  Erika was such a pleasure to deal with and check-in was simple.  It is a 5 minute walk to an incredible beach with picturesque views.  We couldn't recommend this place enough!
44515,73379935,2016-05-08,14106315,New,"Great place.  Very well kept outdoors area and a really nice interior.  For the price, this place is a real steal.  Has everything you need."

The cottage is quite cozy and comfortable, perfect for two people and, in our case, two pups. It was extremely quiet, other than Doves and Jays calling, and the faint sound of surf, we didn't hear a peep. We appreciated the yummy cookies on arrival, the organic breakfast treats in the fridge, delicious coffee, and the earth friendly products provided. We made use of the galley kitchen for a few meals which was great. Erika and Blake were very available for any questions or needs but otherwise gave us much privacy. We love the location and accessibility to the beach, nice walks as well as good food nearby, and look forward to another visit in the future. "
44515,74254817,2016-05-14,43305710,Jason,"Erika and Blake were the perfect hosts and their cottage was charming and wonderful.

I highly recommend their place and we'll definitely be back the next time in we're in the area. "

We liked the private quarters and everything was thought of - comfy bathrobes, towels, shampoo (for color treated hair!) and good snacks.  We would both go back and would recommend it to others.  Thanks for sharing your lovely space with us!"
44515,75741422,2016-05-22,75688,Steffan,"We Loved the Cottage, it was everything they said and better.
Erika meet us with fresh baked cookies and it got better after that.
The location is perfect, close to the beach and town. The bed was amazingly comfortable, and they had everything we could possible need. We enjoyed relaxing on the patio too. This will be our go to place in the future when we go south, loved it."
44515,76208208,2016-05-25,1295280,Bill And Eleanor,"We come to Pacific Grove regularly from Cambria (we have an airbnb there) and this is one of our favorite getaways.  We've stayed in a variety of places and this is certainly one of the best.  In a quiet neighborhood not far from the beach and walkable to town (about 1.5 miles), the cute cottage is private with its own small courtyard, a comfortable king size bed, small kitchenette, and full bath (shower).
The hosts have stocked the kitchenette with breakfast goodies including granola and fresh baked cookies which we greatly appreciated.  It's close to the butterfly garden park, lighthouse and a golf course, also.  All in all we couldn't expect to be better accommodated by an airbnb, anywhere.
"
44515,76508387,2016-05-27,9971639,Rick And Linda,Great neighborhood. A short walk to the beach. Good parking. Very clean and comfortable. We love Pacific Grove. it's the last of the old fashioned towns. We will be back. Only meet our host once but she was very friendly and approchable. They have the cutest little girl.
44515,77101041,2016-05-30,12304009,Jackie,This was our second time staying at this beautiful AirBnB and we somehow loved it even more than the first time! (And we LOVED it the first time) This place seriously is the best!! It was close to all the things we want to go in Carmel and Monterey. The breakfast they provide in he fridge was perfect and the coffee was amazing. Every morning we walked to the ocean. Parking is easy and the place is so so so clean! You feel like your are on your own retreat. We will be back for a third time for sure! Highly recommended ❤️
44515,77529769,2016-06-01,25045534,Lauren,"My husband and I had a wonderful time in Erika and Blake's cottage. There were many things we loved about our stay:
1. Our larger dog, Destiny, was warmly welcomed and that could not make us any happier.
2. The location of the cottage was great with easy access to restaurants and a short drive to Carmel or the Monterey Aquarium. 
3. The cottage was well stocked and equipped with the items we needed. 
4. Erika & Blake provided a lovely breakfast tray with organic yogurt, granola, strawberries, bread, jam, butter and cream. The coffee was delicious as well.
5. I personally loved the decor and style of the cottage! Erika & Blake have great taste! 
6. Erika was very easy to communicate with and responsive to texts. 

We are so thankful for their hospitality and would recommend this stay to any of our family and friends."
44515,77778755,2016-06-03,52818551,Jana,"Erika greeted us at the Gate.  She was so gracious & nice, we felt like we knew her already.  She showed us the path to the cottage.  The cottage was clean, cozy, quiet, and comfortable.  We found the cottage to be very efficient to ""live"" in, and we felt quite at home.  The breakfast Erika provided was delightful, with delicious granola, fresh strawberries, toast, yogurt; all our favorites.  The location was perfect, so close to shops downtown.  We have already recommended the Cottage to my brother & his wife.  We hope to return again some time.  It was well worth the stay!"
44515,78122122,2016-06-05,1747482,Rolayne,"We have stayed here before and are looking forward to staying again in the future.  The cottage is exactly as it looks in the photos.  No surprises!  Everything works, the location is great, its very clean, and Erika and Blake are the perfect hosts."
44515,80029619,2016-06-15,4843279,Pam & Bob,"Pet-Friendly Cottage in Pacific Grove is FABULOUS. 
We arrived in the afternoon to this charming, peaceful & very private cottage surrounded by lovely gardens.  Our cottage behind the main house was even nicer than the photos; super clean, tastefully decorated and stocked with staples for our use - our hosts even welcomed us with fresh berries, yogurt, bread & butter.  The kitchen is small but very functional with a gas stove, 1/2 sized fridge, microwave, toaster and lots of cooking tools, glasses, plates & cutlery. We enjoyed dining each day in the private patio and sleeping each night in the super comfy bed. The bathroom is large and stocked with plenty of towels and guest robes. 
Location is a short walk to the rocky ocean beachfront park with dog-friendly hiking and biking trails a great place to watch the sun set.  The cottage is only minutes from Trader Joe's, gas stations, restaurants and the Monterey Bay Aquarium; a short drive to Carmel and 30 minutes to Big Sur. 
Although we never met Erika personally as she was out of town, Blake and daughter Camilla were so welcoming and friendly that we felt right at home.  
Pet-Friendly Cottage provided the perfect ending to our west coast vacation. We will definitely be back for an extended stay!!
Thank you, thank you, Erika & Blake."
44515,80356803,2016-06-17,8735324,Carolyn,"Great location, easy to find and park; very private and well-planned studio.  Hosts were welcoming and we will stay here again!  Highly recommended."

44515,82852015,2016-06-29,34596985,Gloria,"Erika was there to greet us upon our arrival.  The cottage is wonderful & very clean.  The treats were fresh & tasted really good.  The breakfast goodies were such a convenience which allowed  us to eat in & then go out for morning bike rides.  The patio & surrounding gardens were enjoyed by us & our small dog.  Really don't have to worry about a dog escape!  So close to everything, including walking to the beach each night for sunset.  We look forward to our next visit.  Thank you so much for a wonderful anniversary memory."
44515,83337653,2016-07-02,53770298,Emily,The hosts and their beautiful cottage were fantastic! We'd definitely recommend staying with Erika and Blake! 
44515,90243047,2016-07-31,1139526,Christine,"We stayed a month at Erika and Blake's cottage with our two dogs.  We could not have asked for a better location. 5 minutes to the dog-friendly beach where the dogs could run off the leash.  Plus, close to Pacific Grove and all the wonderful restaurants!  The hosts were great and responded to all our minor requests.  Would love to stay there again in the future."
44515,91322672,2016-08-04,35726931,Mari,"I had a wonderful stay in Erika and Blake's cottage! The location is perfect --close to downtown Pacific Grove and within walking distance to Asilomar beach. I was greeted upon my arrival with delicious breakfast goodies and an incredibly clean and neat cottage. The bed was comfortable, the decor was charming, and the kitchen was perfect for my needs. I was also able to bring my dog with me! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone wanting a truly comfortable stay in Pacific Grove. I will definitely be returning. "
44515,92109222,2016-08-07,52556354,Sanne,"Our stay at their cottage couldn't have been any better! They were so kind and generous and we felt right at home. The cottage was clean, tastefully decorated and the bed were amazing. If we didn't live across the world from pacific grove we would definitely come back every weekend! "
44515,92702915,2016-08-09,60081076,Crista,"Erika and Blake's Cottage felt welcoming instantly. We were amazed at the personal touches that made it feel like a resort beach house. They even left a list of nearby restaurants, and the treats in the fridge were very fresh and tasty. We felt very comfortable and safe in the sleepy, quiet neighborhood. The five minute walk to the dog friendly beach was our favorite part! Thank you again, Blake and Erika, for making your sweet cottage available!"
44515,94094909,2016-08-14,48894265,Gerard,A lovely relaxing home from home accommodation.  Great location close to the ocean.  Very private  and comfortable.  Highly recommended.   
44515,94709804,2016-08-16,12086571,Guy,"Erika's cottage is absolutely stunning. Situated behind the main house, it is separate and therefore thoroughly private. The bed is amazingly comfortable and the shower is perfect. Erika left us breakfast supplies for two days (yoghurt, bread, jam, fruit) and even cookies upon arrival. The cottage is in Pacific Grove - from here, you can easily explore Monterey and Carmel by driving or Uber. There is also a bus stop just around the corner from which you can catch a bus to downtown Monterey to see the Aquarium or the Historic sector. The sea is very nearby too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to explore the Monterey peninsula. It's really cosy and comfortable and Erika is a lovely host. We hope to be back one day! "
44515,95187701,2016-08-18,29859302,Clare,"We had the most wonderful few days at Erika's place, the cottage is very quiet and relaxing and is decorated beautifully. We particularly enjoyed all the lovely organic produce Erika provided, delicious! 
Spent the days down on the beach, at Carmel and Monterey. Would highly recommend staying here. "

44515,96857035,2016-08-24,54002277,Gail,"This was our first stay at an Airbnb property.   It was so fantastic my husband and I are almost afraid to stay anywhere else fearing that it would be a let down.  Beautiful room, large private garden; first class food, amenities, kitchen equipment and total privacy.  Pacific Grove is a charming seaside town without the crowds and honkytonk of Monterrey and Santa Cruz.
"
44515,97844136,2016-08-28,53465435,Jessica,Everything was amazing! Location was in a safe and very nice neighborhood! Definitely recommended! 
44515,98667393,2016-09-01,85369824,Robin,"Perfect location close to the ocean. Very lovely setting with English style courtyards surrounding the area.  Beautifully decorated cottage, architecture is quite unique with it's own private courtyard. We had a wonderful stay, thank you Erica & Blake!"
44515,99169855,2016-09-03,16675513,Steve,Cozy little cottage. Spotlessly clean and very quiet. Has lots of natural light. Nice touches like cookies and breakfast goodies. Erika was very nice when we had to change our reservation and kept us informed all throughout our stay. Will definitely be back.
44515,99833029,2016-09-06,40606865,Cole,"We stayed at the Cottage for 2 nights, but wish we could have stayed for 10! The cottage itself is clean & beautiful, and we felt more than welcome upon arrival. Instructions were clear and easy and our stay felt effortless. The private patio just outside is perfect for a drink in the evening or breakfast in the morning. The surrounding area has much to offer as well. The nearby beach is beautiful, and there's tons of great hikes and views to find along Route 1."
44515,100335327,2016-09-08,59855919,Phil,Stayed 2 nights in this great little quaint cottage. Erika and Blake were very friendly and engaging. Enjoyed our chat over an evening glass of wine. The cottage has all the facilities required and has a super comfortable bed. Pacific Grove and Monterey restaurants are nearby as is the coast which was great for morning walks.
44515,101291735,2016-09-12,57050333,Julie,"Erika began communicating with me as we were approaching the are - after a long and very stressful day. She was so re-assuring and helpful about changed travel plans making excellent suggestions.
The welcome and extras - like marvellous breakfast ingredients were so appreciated.
The cottage is perfect from the cosy wrap all the way through to the condiments basket to spice up the take away!
What's not to love when I could relax in a Mediterranean themed garden and spy hummingbirds going about their day.
This was my first AirBNB stay and it was perfect.
Thank you so much Erika and Blake for everything."
44515,101866889,2016-09-15,78654586,Michael,"Terrific hosts, offered assistance at any time, location and unit exactly as described, great location, healthy fresh breakfast foods provide for every morning there."
44515,102368109,2016-09-17,84572786,Lucy,"What a great stay! Don't forget to take that 5 minute walk to Asilomar beach. We nearly missed it but decided to go last minute.  The studio space is well used and the kitchenette was a huge plus. Erika was very quick to respond to all messages. Clean, quiet, and super cute. Will book again."
44515,103120917,2016-09-20,57853141,Camilla,What a fabulous place. Location is  stunning. The cottage is amazing. Saw reviews all saying how comfortable the bed was... the best nights sleep I've had since being here. Amazing bed. I would certainly recommend this place. Thanks Blake & Erica for letting us stay at your gorgeous cottage.
44515,103621332,2016-09-23,32526643,Andrew,The best Airbnb I have had to date. The place is beautiful and the location is perfectly close to Asilomar beach. The kitchen and unit are stocked with any and all needs you may have. Erika & Blake are tremendous hosts and left delicious organic breakfast treats in the fridge as well as recommendations for places to eat nearby. If I return to Monterey/PG I will try not to stay anywhere else.
44515,104533704,2016-09-27,12320357,William,Superb stay; wonderfully peaceful location 5 min walk to sea
44515,104983225,2016-09-29,38664537,Grant,"This is a gold standard in airbnb. Lovely private accommodation in a great location.  5 minute walk to ocean, couple miles to restaurants, really enjoyed our stay.  I would stay here anytime."
44515,105698242,2016-10-02,9454967,Laura,Cute little cottage in a great location. Close to everything. A minute bike ride to the beach! We loved it!
44515,106563249,2016-10-06,36624052,Dave,"Great little cottage! Terrific attention to details, nice coffee, breakfast goodies, excellent shampoo and conditioner, even a dvr for those that prefer to record shows and skip commercials. Excellent location in beautiful Pacific Grove. Would highly recommend it!"
44515,107239148,2016-10-09,61969997,Sharon,"The cottage is a gem!! It is in the best location in Pacific Grove. It is absolutely charming,  super comfortable, with everything one might need, and has a lovely patio. The granola, yogurt, and cookies were delicious. Communication with hosts was excellent! Wish we could stay much longer! "
44515,107857617,2016-10-12,62165742,David,"Our time at Erika and Blake's cozy Cottage was delightful and relaxed. It is so close to the ocean, walking trails, and a quiet neighborhood but also just a short distance from ""downtown"" Pacific Grove. It's great to have a pet-friendly environment where our dog felt comfortable, as well. It is very private with good amenities including excellent coffee and granola. The bed was very comfortable. We hope to return in the future. "
44515,109492708,2016-10-21,975366,Bethany,Amazing location! Beautiful little cottage! Great hostess. Erika met us not longer after we arrived. Friendly and yet gave us privacy.The beach walk along Asliomar state park is amazing and worth the trip alone. The place was well equipped and comfy.Everything seems to be thought of in this little place.We would LOVE to return!
44515,109974364,2016-10-23,35726931,Mari,"Another great stay at the cottage! As before Erika and Blake have a clean, comfortable cottage with nice add-ons such as delicious coffee and breakfast items. The location cannot be beat. I'll be coming back to their place again and again!"
44515,110384291,2016-10-25,66387664,Don,"Erika and Blake went over and above to make sure everything was perfect for us.  The cottage is adorable and decorated just perfectly.  As this cottage is basically in their back yard one might be concerned for privacy, but they have done everything possible to offer complete privacy.  There is a fenced off yard behind the cottage that was perfect for the dogs.
Erika was in constant communication before our check-in to make it easy for us.  The neighborhood is so quiet and just a couple short (and absolutely beautiful) blocks to the most gorgeous beach.
The bed was divine!  So comfortable!!
The only bad thing was having to leave...we want to move in!
Thank you Erika and Blake, we absolutely will be back!"
44515,110854690,2016-10-28,19403194,Betty,My host welcomed us and was available if we needed anything  Our cottage felt  very comfortable. Bed was great. It was quiet and a nice retreat after a day of sightseeing. I would visit again. I'm 
44515,111369383,2016-10-30,5878565,Jill,"We had a nice relaxing weekend!  Thank you so much.  What a great location and such a charming cottage.  We walked down to the ocean a couple of times, went downtown for dinner, walked around Carmel, Monterey and Pacific Grove.  Would love to stay here again.  Thanks Erika and Blake!"
44515,112200298,2016-11-04,66445888,Charyl,"We loved staying at Erika and Blakes's place! The location is perfect for us and our small dogs! We loved the beach trail and beach walks and near by off road trail! The cottage is comfortable and cozy! The amenities are exactly as advertised! The bed was comfy, nicely stocked kitchen, great breakfast, especially great coffee! Nice place to get away st the beach, we gave already booked two more trips to stay here next year! Pacific Grove is our favorite, low key beach town and this us our favorite place we have stayed in PG! Many thanks! Flawless communication, great hosts! Can't wait to come back! All the Best, Charyl and Dale and Brodie and Nova"
44515,112677532,2016-11-06,16062909,Sara & Tony,"Heavenly. Best airbnb we've been to! Perfectly appointed, private, lovely. Excellent location for walks along the shore and adventures in town. Hosts were awesome - went way above and beyond to make our stay easier and to make us feel welcome! Would LOVE to come back soon!!"
44515,114530314,2016-11-19,45544071,David,"The cottage was clean, cozy, relaxing, and very private.  You could hear the ocean with the windows open.  The beach at the end of Pico Boulevard is spectacular rock formations and waves.  Erika and Blake were very cordial and communicated well with us.   This place is superb!
"
44515,115085684,2016-11-21,29603368,Dominik,"This is a wonderful place and great hosts!  The place is a walking distance to a scenic ocean view and close to local restaurants.  The house provides complete privacy and is very comfortable.  This is a great place if you plan a road trip to Big Sur or want to check out Monterey, CA.  We stopped at Erika & Blake's place on the way from LA to San Francisco.  I highly recommend this place."
44515,115404395,2016-11-24,1210741,Trudi,"Have lost track of how many times we have been here. The best Airbnb in the world for sure. Wonderful hosts, incredibly cute place in a perfect location. Love it! Recent upgrades are cool..such as the new floor and kitchen island. Looking forward to our next visit."
44515,115561375,2016-11-25,85308812,Emily,"My husband & I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday as a short get away and completely fell in love with Erika & Blake's cottage as well as the area! Erika and Blake made us feel super welcomed and had great hospitality! The cottage is just as the pictures display if not nicer, and has all of the amenities listed! It is super close to all of the tourist spots that we visited such as Point Lobos, down town Carmel, and the beach! I definitely recommend this cottage to anyone staying in Carmel! "
44515,116259460,2016-11-28,21783298,Mindy,"This was our third stay at The Cottage. It is the perfect size for a get-away for a couple and our Great Dane. The description is exact on. The bed really is like sleeping on a cloud, even with a bad back. The kitchenette is perfect for reheating left-overs, adding to breakfast and has all the gear to create a meal if desired. It has a small stove, oven and fridge, as well as a microwave, coffee maker and toaster. The room can get chilly, however the free-standing heater toasts the suite up quickly. The bathroom is nicely decorated and clean with some toiletries included (as well as a hair dryer). A large-screen TV, DVD player and cable access can entertain if you want to relax in the room. On a quiet night, you can almost hear the ocean roaring and with a two-block walk, you are right on the shore. The cottage is very private, even with windows and doors open. We knew the hosts were there, but never saw them or their dog, except when welcomed when we arrived. It is a 5-10 minute drive to downtown Pacific Grove and the wharf and 20 minutes or less to Carmel. We can go on and on, but nothing will say more than you need to experience ""The Cottage."" "
44515,116596863,2016-12-01,70978741,Marilyn,"This was my first stay at an airbnb and I couldn't have made a better choice. The cottage is unbelievably clean, comfortable, private, and beautifully decorated. I especially appreciated the personal touches - nice linens, earth friendly cleaning products, great shampoo, absolutely delicious organic coffee and breakfast items. The kitchen was well stocked and perfect for my needs and yes, the bed is like sleeping on a cloud! The private patio and gardens are lovely and the perfect spot for morning coffee, evening glass of wine or just relaxing. I enjoyed several walks along the most beautiful rocky shore beach just 5 minutes away. Erika and Blake have gone out of their way to make their guest feel welcome and at home. Thank-you for sharing your lovely cottage and perfect location! "
44515,120007576,2016-12-06,5530667,Judy,"The place is a gem as is the town of Pacific Grove. Erika and Blake are thoughtful, friendly hosts. The place was just 2 1/2 hours south of San Francisco (without traffic). If you need a couple of days to unwind, Erika and Blake's cottage is the ticket. From their place, it's  a lovely, short walk to Asilomar State Beach (fantastic sunsets at this time of year - wow!). And if you want to keep walking - there is a great coastal trail. 

The cottage is well stocked if you feel the need to dine in - but, if you don't feel like cooking (we didn't), the restaurants of Pacific Grove are just a few minutes away. We love the Red House Cafe and Pepper's Mexican Restaurant - relaxed atmosphere, friendly, full of locals and delicious food. There are plenty of other suggestions in the guest handbook.

Also, if you don't feel like rushing out in the mornings, there were tasty breakfast items in the fridge plus coffee. Very thoughtful. We'll definitely be back!"
44515,120196719,2016-12-08,88311544,Robert,"Charming, cosy cottage. We stayed in December and we were comfortably warm inside the cottage. The kitchen is equipped with has everything you need to make simple meals including spices, honey and olive oil. There is beautiful light in this cottage and the cottage has a delightful courtyard that is enclosed with Victorian inset windows, potted flowers and twisty vines. Bed is comfortable and soft which could be an issue if you have one of those backs that needs a firm mattress. You can watch cable TV from bed or watch any DVDs you might bring. The two reading chairs are comfortable. Homemade chocolate chip cookies were a hit (took a photo of the recipe so we could make at home). Definitely would want to keep this place a secret so that we can stay here again...
Walking distance to the beautiful Asilomar Beach. And be sure to go to the Monarch Sanctuary (we found the brochure in the drawer next to the bed) and got to see the butterflies emerge after a light rain. If you check out Pavel's Backerei (a place mentioned in Erika and Blake's handbook) you REALLY do need to go early -everything they bake was sold by 1pm the day we stopped by.
Thank you Erika and Blake!


"
44515,120833839,2016-12-11,4168982,Tom,This was our fifth time staying at the cottage.  It is always a great time and everything goes without a hitch!  Highly recommended!
44515,121536053,2016-12-17,15449505,Hope,"This is my second time staying at this wonderful cottage. I actually arranged my trip at a time that it was available because  I didn't want to stay anywhere else.  It's incredibly cozy, the host provides breakfast and it's walking distance to the beach. I could just go on and on. Much better than any hotel! Thank you for your attention to detail Erika and Blake. :)"
44515,121949949,2016-12-19,33369430,Rebecca,"If you look at the booking calendar that says it all!!! I booked almost a year in advance to get the dates I wanted. The place is sweet, charming, comfortable, convient and perfect!! The warm amazing chocolate chip cookies waiting on the counter make your heart happy!! One of the nicest Air B&B's I have found. All I can say is try to stay more than two nights. Thank you Erika and Blake for sharing your cottage :)"
44515,122213753,2016-12-21,638768,David,"Our trip was 4 years in the making and the wait was definitely worth it. We had a relaxing time and felt like we were at home. The cottage is super quiet, cozy, and comfortable. We travel with our 2 cats and they loved it! The garden was a huge hit with them. They walked all around (on their leashes) and just loved exploring and watching the birds. Such a nice visit."
44515,123178163,2016-12-27,61569660,Linda,"Our experience was everything other guests have described and more.  My husband is Celiac and Erika had made sure that we had gluten free cookies, breakfast cereal and raisin bread.  We were expecting, perhaps, breakfast goodies for one day - they lasted four!  Next time, we'll leave our food at home!  Also, the location is perfect!  It's a short walk to the ocean and an easy, few minutes drive to downtown Pacific Grove.  It's also really quiet.  We slept in every day!"
44515,123582229,2016-12-29,62161267,Renee,"Erika sent us an email the day of our arrival and also welcomed us as soon as we arrived. The homemade cookies were also very welcoming. We found the cottage even sweeter than the pictures and loved that you could hear the ocean at night as well as see the stars. It truly is the nicest Airbnb that we have experienced. We enjoyed the proximity to the ocean and that it's in a quiet neighborhood. We also enjoyed our dog feeling so welcomed. The kitchen has everything and the breakfasts were delicious. Very importantly, the bed was even more comfortable than our own."
44515,124492876,2017-01-01,7838511,Richard,"This property is one of our very favorite in the Monterey area...perfect location, easy walk to the shore, very quiet and private. The property is casual and very clean and Erika is the perfect hostess. The only problem is that is too popular! "
44515,125051420,2017-01-03,90541714,Shelby,"Erika was very flexible about our arrival time as it changed a few times. She even turned on the lights and heater for us since we arrived in the night. There were chocolate chip cookies waiting for us when we arrived and she gave us some freshly baked ones for the road as we left. The neighborhood was beautiful and way closer to the beach than we realized. It was great! It took us less than 5 minutes jogging to get to the beach. 
Another thing we loved was the breakfast that was provided. The yogurt and granola, bread and fruit lasted us the two mornings we were there. The cottage was very organized and had everything we needed. We'd love to come back. "
44515,125422622,2017-01-05,8479252,Alayna &,"This is the best AirBNB we've stayed at by far, super friendly people, incredibly cute daughter and pup, lovely space with great decor, very easy to locate.  We were only there a couple of nights so mostly hiked in Big Sur which is convenient to get to.  Loved taking walks to the beach at the end of the day and spotted some harbor seals, including a baby (!) resting there.
Kitchen had everything you could possibly need, my husband is a professional chef and was quite pleased.  As many have mentioned, the bed is truly like sleeping on a cloud.  Also really appreciated the Pay Per View, we had some rainy days (stayed in Winter) and it was perfect to put on PJ's and relax with some movies.  We almost had to force ourselves to leave the place each day and go do things because it was just so cozy."
44515,126005861,2017-01-08,4811034,Andrew,"We had the perfect stay at Erika and Blake’s cottage. 

The space is clean, stylish, comfortable, and downright adorable.  We arrived to a plate of tasty homemade chocolate chip cookies and found a hearty breakfast for the next morning in the fridge.  The kitchenette has everything you'd need for a few days stay. The king sized bed is incredibly comfortable.  There is a great seating area outside the cottage that offers some privacy.  The cottage is equipped with tons of small conveniences so you never go wanting: extra towels, tea and coffee, umbrellas, great bath products, and more.

Amazing location.  Walkable to the beach, near downtown Monterey, quick drive to Carmel, and not far from great hiking and scenery in Big Sur.

Erika was great with communication, made herself available to us as needed, but gave us our space and privacy.

If you're looking for a cozy, romantic spot near Carmel and Big Sur, this is a perfect rental for you. 

Thanks Erika and Blake!  We’ll be back!"

44515,128116036,2017-01-22,35726931,Mari,"Erika and Blake's cottage is honestly the best vacation rental I've ever stayed at. The location is perfect, the home is incredibly clean, and the breakfast goodies are a wonderful bonus.  As a dog owner, it is so wonderful to be able to bring my furry one along with me. I could go on and on, but this is the 3rd time I've stayed here and I already have two more trips on the books--I think that says it all!"
44515,128541964,2017-01-25,96874204,Kristina,"This place exceeded my expectations, fridge was stocked with breakfast items and we had the cookies waiting for us!

44515,129724045,2017-02-01,50492345,Anne,"The cottage is beautifully decorated, very quiet and within walking distance to the ocean. Blake and Erika had wonderful chocolate chip cookies waiting for us along with the most delicious granola.  The small kitchen had everything we needed to make breakfasts and dinners. The patio is secluded from the main house and gives you privacy in a wonderful setting. We loved our walks to the beach through a very quiet neighborhood. We highly recommend this cottage if you want charm, peacefulness and a great night of sleep. We look forward to returning and staying longer next time. "
44515,131162686,2017-02-10,29784983,Rob,"Erika and Blake's charming cottage is clean, cozy, and comfortable at a very reasonable rate. Situated as a garden cottage in a large yard behind the main house, it combines quiet and privacy with the feeling of home. The major
plus is the ocean just a block away for morning walks evening sunsets and whale watching. "
44515,131653784,2017-02-12,80620821,Jim,"Erika & Blake's cottage is a wonderful place to stay!  It is nicely decorated, peaceful, quiet and a short walk to the ocean.  We had a relaxing stay and look forward to coming back soon!   "

44515,133149761,2017-02-20,23586116,Michelle,"Erika and Blake's cottage is exactly as they described it. Tucked away in a sweet neighborhood that is just a couple of blocks away from the beach, their cozy space was a perfect place to relax on my getaway from San Francisco and I would absolutely return again. They were very kind to provide a welcome breakfast (toast, berries, yogurt), coffee, and Erika's home baked cookies! The cottage also had a super comfy bed, fluffy robes, and great shower products. Erika and Blake were super friendly and very easy to communicate with making check in and check out seamless. I definitely suggest booking their cottage if you want a convenient home base to visit Big Sur/ Monterey/Carmel from. "

44515,135677235,2017-03-05,53342076,Tracy,"Fantastic cottage for so many reasons! This is a great location for attending conferences at Asilomar. I could walk there in 10 minutes. It's also walking distance to the beach and a short drive to Monterey and Carmel.

Erika was very accommodating when we had to check in a tad earlier due to the conference start time and there were fresh baked chocolate chip cookies (omg amazing) and breakfast goodies waiting in the fridge. We got to meet her in person and she was all smiles and very sweet.

They also had a comprehensive binder full of useful information about the place and places to go eat/things to do etc. 

The cottage has everything you need (towels/hairdryer/dishes). Overall, a wonderful stay! "

44515,136420727,2017-03-10,66108808,Ti,"We like the area, it is very quiet and not far from the beach, Carmel and Monterey.  Erika is good host, she provided us a healthy breakfast and fruits. The cottage is a smaller than we expected, it is good for one person, a little too small for 2 people if you plan to stay for more than 3 days."

A delightful, we'll equipped cottage where Erica had clearly taken great care in the quality and detail of the experience for her guests.

And Pacific Grove itself is a lovely town. "

44515,143199492,2017-04-10,25824766,Andrea,"I had the best experience at Erika's and Blake's. There guest house is a hidden treasure of pacific grove. It was the first time I had taken my 9 month old out of town. It went so smoothly and Erika was so accommodating to let us borrow a pack and play for my son to sleep in. She also provided cute baby books for us to read to him. I loved those little touches. They also have a super helpful binder and delicious cookies ready for you. We went to a couple of their recommendations and loved them. My favorite was Fishermans Wife, which is about a 10 min walk or 2 min drive. The cottage is a 5 min walk from a gorgeous beach. It was the perfect getaway, everything I needed was close by. We are looking forward to booking again! "

From the moment that you step through the gate to their place, it feels like you've stepped into a magical secret garden.  Once inside the cottage, it's evident that they have put a lot of work and expense into making their place perfect.  The décor is charming, and the bed/bedding extremely comfortable.  The coffee, breakfast items, and cookies were just icing on the cake.  Definitely one of the best places I've ever stayed while traveling!"

44515,148551549,2017-05-01,22894707,Kimberley,"SUCH an amazing place to stay. Erika and Blake have created a truly beautiful space that is both comfortable and adorable. My husband, our pup and I really enjoyed not only our stay, but the area. At Erika and Blake's place you are only minutes to downtown and the beach. What else could you ask for? Oh how about the world's most comfortable bed and delicious granola/fruit for breakfast? They had that too. We will definitely be coming back sometime soon! Thanks so much Erika and Blake!"

44515,158882747,2017-06-09,77523235,Sarah,"We stayed at this beautiful cottage for 2 nights and we wish it could have been longer. Everything about the accommodation was top class with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!  Erica provided delicious breakfast muesli, yoghurt, fruit, bread, butter, jam, tea and coffee as well as the most delicious cookies on arrival ( which were eaten almost immediately)  Downtown PG is easily walkable as well as being close to the beach. Monterey and Carmel are a short drive away.  I cannot recommend this idyllic cottage highly enough."

Without big city lights we could see a magnificent night sky. The property was clean and well maintained. There is a small kitchen that is equipped with all appliances and cooking tools. Erika and Blake, the hosts, provided us with as much privacy we desired, but they were easily available and always willing to help us when we had any questions or required assistance. We enjoyed our stay and wish we could have stayed longer. We give Erika and Blake's place 11 out of 10 stars!!"

It is delightfully decorated, and has perfect touches to make your stay enjoyable - organic breakfast items, wonderful homemade cookies, soft robes, bathroom toiletries, even umbrellas in the event of showers.  The little courtyard, perfect for morning coffee or evening dinner, often visited by hummingbirds.  We brought our two little dogs and walked them to the ocean every morning.  We biked into downtown for lunch, too.  Erika made us feel very welcomed, and we definitely hope to return!!  I'd give this cottage 10 stars if I could!!"

Erica and Blake are great hosts, popping out to say hello when they see you and offering suggestions of local things to see and places to eat.  We were out sight-seeing for most of our stay, however I could have easily curled up in the very comfortable bed and had tea and one of Erica's delicious cookies and relaxed with a book or just looking at the lovely gardens outside.
I hope we will be back someday!!"

The cottage is adorable, clean, comfy, private and Erika and Blake made it so easy to communicate with and are amazing hosts.

The decoration throughout was of a high & modern standard. The little walled garden we had was peaceful and a great place to spot squirrels, bluejays and hummingbirds.

Was one of, if not the nicest place, we have stayed. Immaculate, beautiful, private and in short, everything we dreamed it would be based on the pictures. Erika and Blake are great hosts and we loved their welcome manual, which displayed humour and friendliness.

Will be recommending to anyone who will listen and would LOVE to go back one day. In fact, I'd love to live there!"

The location is a great jumping off point for Carmel, Monterey, Pebble Beach and Pacific Grove.  Super quiet neighborhood setting and you can take a short walk to the coast to watch the sunset and wild life.  (Whales spouting offshore, seals and even a dolphin.. )  Nice private patio area with separation from the main house and yard.  Erika and Blake provided great communication and their hospitality was above expectations.  Great coffee (with cream!), breakfast snacks, cookies and a nice bottle of wine when we arrived.

44515,196587588,2017-09-23,2253670,Phillip,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME !!  Now that I have you attention, this is what I mean: stop looking!! This is where you want to stay!! THIS is what all Airbnb hosts should aspire to!  I have traveled to over 65 countries, with most of that traveling done in the Airbnb style (before Airbnb even existed) using local contacts, (Hidden by Airbnb) , Home Exchange, etc. I have used Airbnb in at least 5 countries. I guess I can sum up the total experience in this way: there is a distinct difference between those who host Airbnb because they can get a few extra bucks from space they have available and those who truly LOVE being hosts. It is apparent from the instant you contact them, throughout the communication process, and obviously during the stay. Erika and Blake fall squarely into the latter category. I spoke briefly with Blake; most of my communication was through Erika. We were able to meet Erika and chat with her for a short while. Anything I can say here would be redundant; it has been stated over and over in these reviews. But you have to see their place to believe it. My earlier point about those who love being hosts is so apparent. When you see their main house it is abundantly clear that they do not need the income from this rental to survive. It is a spectacular home, and they are obviously very successful in their respective businesses. It is for this reason that it becomes clear that it is a pleasure for them to host – not a chore. They have created a luxurious get-away that provided me with quite a few ideas for my own home remodel. The attention to detail is unparalleled. They apologized for having to temporarily install a brand new refrigerator....because it didn't fit the décor!!  There is one HUGE negative to this experience: after you stay here, all of your future Airbnb stays are sure to disappoint – at least in some small measure. Blake and Erika have set the bar to a new high. Bravo!!"
44515,197441205,2017-09-25,35726931,Mari,"Erika and Blake have created such a comfortable and homey cottage, tucked away in a beautiful part of Pacific Grove. Every detail is attended to--delicious breakfast goodies, comfy beach chairs, extra blankets for those cool nights. I can't imagine a better Airbnb experience."
44515,197958627,2017-09-27,114892710,Colette,"This place is really sweet, hostess puts extra effort and touches like homemade granola, coffee, fresh fruit.
The studio is decorated very beachy like, nice bathroom, little kitchenette.
I would recommend this place, it cools off nicely in evenings and mornings."
44515,199224516,2017-10-01,36079406,Maddie,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at this adorable place! Seriously only minutes from the water with unbelievable sunsets, incredible service from the amazing family, and just unbeatable accommodations with the cutest details. Everything we needed was there for us from breakfast to recommendations on where to eat and go to shampoo/conditioner to Erika's yummy cookies! We just absolutely loved everything about our stay and can't wait to be back!"
44515,200203882,2017-10-04,46320722,Barbara,"Loved this place.  Neighborhood is the best, very quiet and secure.  Cottage
had everything we needed.  So glad to be able to bring our dog to such a 
beautiful town and have hosts that accept her.  Would love to return soon."
44515,200748914,2017-10-06,116792363,Ed,"If you want a great small private cottage to stay in while visiting the Monterey Bay area look no further than Erika and Blake's rental in Pacific Grove.   This unit is on the small side at 400 square feet, but it has all the comforts of home and is well appointed with beautiful furnishings.  The bed and pillows are very comfortable and the location is private & quiet, so it is easy to get a good nights rest.  And it's location provides you with a short walk to Asilomar Beach or a quick drive to downtown Pacific Grove or Monterey.  Erika is a lovely person and came by to check on us after arrival to ensure we had everything to make our stay top notch.  She is definitely an outstanding Airbnb hostess!"
44515,201937436,2017-10-09,88729090,John,"Very charming, peaceful, and relaxing. Such a cute place and close to everything. It’s a great place for a weekend gettaway. Can’t wait to visit again!"
44515,202942508,2017-10-13,975987,Angelika,Wonderful cottage in wonderful location. Super easy communication and check-in. We had a great stay with our dogs. Thank you
44515,203795857,2017-10-15,14385840,Ashley,"Pacific Grove is quite the hidden gem... it's cute, quaint and close to all the central coast attractions, so to think I found a hidden gem inside of a hidden gem was a treat in itself! Erika & Blake's place is definitely that shiny diamond that you're looking for right off the coast!

From the moment my sister and I arrived we were blown away! This quaint and cozy little cottage was more perfect than we could've imagined! The place has a lovely charm about it, rustic yet modern mixed with a southern charm. Everything was clean and neatly organized. The ""welcome book"" outlined everything from the ""to dos"" at the cottage to ""must eat and dos"" while in the central coast. 

The hospitality was amazing. Erika could hear when we arrived and was already messaging me to make sure we had everything we needed. To our surprise we found more than expected! Breakfast treats for the morning were stashed away in the fridge. Homemade (to die for) chocolate chip cookies were awaiting our presence. (The DoubleTree ain't got nothin' Erika's cookies!) The little kitchenette was filled with all the essentials, including an assortment of teas! These were just a few of the many amenities that they went above and beyond to make us feel at home.

We were able to meet Erika and to no surprise she was wonderful! Just as accommodating, friendly and helpful in person as she had been through message. Truly a delight! 

Although my sister and I were visiting because of a ""girls/sister trip,"" we feel this place is a perfect pairing for any person, couple, friends or family who are looking for a double occupancy on the central coast!! 

OH... and this place is a 5-10minute walk to the ocean... not that you needed another excuse to book this hidden gem, but just in case there was your icing on the cake!!

Thanks for a wonderful stay Erika & Blake!! I hope to make back to visit again one day!"
44515,204374545,2017-10-17,7128059,Ronald,Our most recent visit to Erika & Blake's cottage was (as it always is) very pleasant.  The place is so well appointed and the private patio area is a great place to relax with a good book and a glass of wine.  The 5 minute walk to the beach for sunset was effortless and reminded me that location does matter.
44515,204958163,2017-10-20,70978741,Marilyn,"Erika and Blake's cottage has become my home away from home. It is absolutely perfect - extremely clean, comfortable, peaceful, and walking distance to the beach. So many nice touches, including fabulous breakfast items, delicious coffee, and a lovely private courtyard and garden. Thanks again to Erika and Blake. I look forward to my next stay."
44515,205816229,2017-10-22,3131459,Mary,"This is a fantastic little cottage blocks from the ocean. It is charming, extremely thoughtfully appointed, and really quiet. The hosts have this down to a science. I only wish there were more Airbnbs of this quality. This was our second time here and I'm about to book a third. If you are looking for a nice dinner, Passionfish is excellent and a 5 minute drive away."
44515,206257654,2017-10-24,1210741,Trudi,"Wonderful and amazing —\0—Best Airbnb ever! Cozy, clean, lovely patio, tasty breakfast, comfy bed,  cheery and friendly hosts, perfect location close to city and beach. Love it here and come as often as we can. Doug and Trudi"

44515,208287057,2017-10-31,8662361,Dana J,"Everything was just great! Instructions for arrival clear and timely. Just loved the area which was new to us and the cottage was a beautiful, relaxing space. So nice to have some cookies on arrival, a great folder full of reccomendations for the area and breakfast goodies. Loved it!"
44515,209719075,2017-11-05,45772830,Carolyn,"We knew this was going to be an amazing place from the pictures and reviews but it was even better than we could have hoped for! Gorgeous space and design, thoughtful hosts down to the most minute detail, in a sensational area of northern California within walking distance to the beach. Couldn't ask for anything more, truly a gem and hope to return soon!"
44515,210483923,2017-11-09,90938417,Debra,"Erika and Blake's cottage is absolutely adorable and cozy. Although it's behind the main house it's very private and even has it's own outdoor seating area. Every detail inside the cottage has been thought of, from the breakfast items in the fridge to the organic coffee and variety of tea bags, to the lovely lavender bath soap and the shampoo and conditioner in the shower. My only regret was not being able to stay longer.  It was lovely meeting Erika and her adorable kids, human and 4-legged.  Thank you for everything!"
44515,210703976,2017-11-10,15679392,Dillon,"Erika and Blake’s cottage is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. It was beautiful, comfortable, clean, and the breakfast and cookies they provided were delicious."
44515,210915693,2017-11-11,12811939,Marin,There's not much more we can say beyond what has already been said.  We loved this little cottage and consider ourselves lucky to have stumbled upon it on airbnb.  Erika and Blake know how to treat their guests - there are so many nice little touches and the cottage itself was so clean and comfortable.  We would stay here again in a heart beat!
44515,211403317,2017-11-12,104796825,Sarah,"I really lucked out in finding Erika & Blake's lovely cottage.  They have created a refuge and I had the best sleep I've had in months when I stayed there.  The added touches of delicious cookies and breakfast in the fridge were icing on the cake.  I would highly recommend staying here, they are great hosts!"
44515,212167099,2017-11-16,20135301,Dan,"Better than advertised! The place is super cute,clean and surprisingly spacious. You get great granola,yogurt,beer,fruit,coffee and amazing chocolate chip cookies with your stay. It had the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. We will definitely stay again. Great location and a lot of privacy."
44515,212427924,2017-11-17,19807279,Alex,Erika and Blake’s place was a dream! A cozy little cottage tucked away in a beautiful place. Our only regret was that we didn’t stay longer!
44515,213561795,2017-11-21,3665758,Ben,Wow...amazing find. Location is spectacular and the little cottage and all it’s amenities were perfect.  This is doing Airbnb right.
44515,213889502,2017-11-23,130805950,Staci,"I would highly recommend staying at Erika and Blake's Cottage. It is even better than the pictures. The location is perfect, and you can even hear the waves at the beach. Erika and Blake were great hosts, and were very helpful. There is so much to do in Pacific Grove and Monterey, and staying in this cottage made our trip even better! We can't thank Erika and Blake enough for their hospitality."
44515,214115735,2017-11-24,1291823,Koncha,We had an absolutely incredible stay at Erika and Blake's cottage. The pictures do not do it justice. It is charming and comfortable. Communication with absolutely fantastic and Erika responded to all my questions immediately. The place was immaculately clean and every comfort you could think of had been provided. Thank you for such an incredible stay!!
44515,215078475,2017-11-27,21783298,Mindy,"This is our FOURTH stay at ""The Cottage"" (what we lovingly call it). The cottage is a perfect getaway location for all of Monterey Bay area and short jaunts to Santa Cruz, Capitola and Carmel. A short two-block walk to the ocean each day is exactly what the Dr prescribes. The goodies that Erika leaves in the fridge for breakfast is delicious and the little kitchenette area is perfect to scramble up a small meal, or heat up left-overs from the delicious local fare. International Cuisine on Lighthouse Ave is one of our favorite locations, with many dishes to choose from (something for everyone) and very personable staff. The small extra's to help your stay are a nice touch, such as umbrellas (needed on this trip), toiletries, a binder with tips for restaurants and activities, patio seating area right outside the door, heater and fan, wi-fi and an extremely comfortable bed, and much more. The neighborhood is quiet and Erika & Blake give plenty of privacy yet are available to answer questions. Our Great Dane loved the property, which is gated, so we could allow him out at night to potty without having to leash him up. We can't rave enough about the cottage. If your looking for a quiet place to relax and explore, book it now!"
44515,216410355,2017-12-03,73539698,Alexa,Erika and Blake are phenomenal hosts. The cottage was central but secluded. The perfect getaway!
44515,217115534,2017-12-07,70978741,Marilyn,Every time I return to this lovely cottage I am amazed at just how perfect it truly is - I absolutely love it here and can't wait to return. Erika and Blake are fabulous hosts who always make me right at home. Highly recommended!
44515,218031539,2017-12-10,4168982,Tom,Always great to stay with Erika and Blake.  Their place is one of our favorite places.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.
44515,218578346,2017-12-13,23961453,Catherine,Amazingly beautiful place had everything you needed in the kitchen and the bathroom. Would definitely go back in a heartbeat
44515,218746550,2017-12-14,41851873,Kyle,Erica's cottage was gorgeous and she welcomed us with cookies. She had great amenities and a super comfy bed. Would love to stay here again sometime.
44515,219135641,2017-12-16,12994619,Donna,It was awesome!
44515,219536842,2017-12-17,161928511,Benedict,"I really recommend this place to anybody that's looking for a getaway. It's quaint, clean, and beautiful. The host provide such a beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) everything it looks like and more. Complete with breakfast and yummy homemade chocolate chip cookies. 🖒🖒😁"
44515,219941902,2017-12-19,53468381,Jeremy,Awesome experience! Highly recommended to other guests out there. Thanks Erika and Blake!
44515,220285244,2017-12-21,45291843,Becky,"Excellent location close to the Asilomar beaches with miles of walking on the trail, quiet, gracious hostess, pristinely clean, the best bed ever had in a rental, thoughtful healthy breakfast items in generous proportions and very nicely appointed decor!  It's a studio so very compact but you have everything you need to cook easy meals plus comfy seating for relaxing!  We would definitely return and recommend this cozy cottage to friends!"
44515,220753396,2017-12-23,33701339,Andrew,"We wish we could have spent our whole week away at Erika and Blake’s place. Every detail - from the cookies, to the breakfast, to the comfy bed - not a detail was missed. We loved being able to take the 5 minute walk down to the beach to start and end our days - the location was perfect!
We are sad about how filled up the place is for even most of 2018 - we really hope to be back. Tyson and Pepper loved the place too and look forward to more beach time in the future!🐶🐶"
44515,223618632,2018-01-01,35726931,Mari,"Erika and Blake's cottage is truly a home away from home for me, which is only made possible by the kind hospitality of the hosts.  Being able to wake up in a deeply comfortable bed, to enjoy a hot cup of delicious coffee provided by the hosts, and to enjoy yummy breakfast goodies is such a wonderful part of this experience.  Furthermore, the quiet neighborhood in close proximity to both the beach and downtown Pacific Grove make this location ideal."
44515,224637612,2018-01-03,5468240,Lindsay,"Erika and Blake’s cottage is so well decorated, comfy, and cozy.  We wish we could have stayed more than two nights.  The neighborhood is quaint and quiet; the beach is close by along with access to the downtown area.  Lots of little touches that just make this place a great place to stay - great coffee, half-n-half, yogurt, fresh berries, granola, bread, jam, and spa-like shampoo and conditioner! :)"
44515,226224376,2018-01-09,107934413,David,"This is the perfect place for you to stay in the Monterey area!  Perfect location to everything, very private, but close enough to hosts.  I would recommend this to anyone!"
44515,226614692,2018-01-11,13285595,Meching,"We booked the cottage for our mini honeymoon getaway with our dogs.  The cottage was amazing beyond words.  It's so charming and welcoming, with everything you need for a vacation by the beach (which is literally a 5 minute walk down the street).  We had such a great time with our two dogs, and I'm so happy Erika and Blake were so accommodating because it's often challenging with a 60 lb. pup.  I sent Erika a quick message regarding our ETA and she was so nice to just stop by and turn on the heater to make the cottage extra cozy for us.  It's these little gestures that make you realize they care about making your stay as comfortable as possible.  Another really nice gesture was the bottle of champagne sitting in ice, as well as breakfast items in the fridge for the next morning.  I'm definitely coming back and recommending this cute cottage to all my family and friends!  Thank you so much Erika and Blake!"
44515,227041361,2018-01-13,15323554,Phil,"A wonderful hideaway. A beautiful ocean nearby, plenty of restaurants and great shopping. "
44515,228051246,2018-01-17,16399132,Kaylee,"Erika and Blake’s cozy little cottage was a perfect home base for us to explore around the Monterey area — walking distance from Asilomar beach, and just a short and easy drive to everywhere else! The amenities and little luxuries in the cottage were just what we needed after hiking and exploring all day. Erika and Blake themselves were more than accommodating and attentive, and couldn’t have been better hosts — we will definitely be visiting again!"
44515,231986174,2018-02-03,7128059,Ronald,Erika and Blake are great hosts and their cottage is simply the best and well located...this visit we enjoyed the new kitchen area... well planned and nicely appointed. Count us among the many who keep coming back time after time. The very best of the Airbnb community.
44515,232430302,2018-02-04,160648360,Jordynn,"I bought a night at Erika & Blake's place as a Christmas gift for my parents. When they came home the next day, they were raving about how nice the place was and how all the nice little touches were incredible. They are already talking about the next time they can stay there! Thank you for making their experience so great!!"
44515,233482063,2018-02-09,288674,Lizzie,"We set up my parents for 2 nights here during the big golf tournament. They couldn’t stop talking about their wonderful  stay! They said it was like “living in a fancy magazine”. So many nice touches and amenities- yogurt, cookies and comfy robes (what kind are these?!?) Appreciated the privacy on the courtyard. So lovely for such a lovely price. Thank you again!"
44515,234165788,2018-02-11,120576725,Barbi,"This is a cozy space with every single detail thought out. If nothing else, come for the home baked cookies which are the best I have ever had! Really though, it is a beautiful and immaculately clean space. All of the extra little touches make it such a gem and Erika & Blake are extremely nice."
44515,234705147,2018-02-13,1210741,Trudi,What a wonderful Airbnb and it gets cuter every time we visit. Love the new kitchenette and other little new details. Erika is so thoughtful with everything ultra comfortable and inviting. Love it!
44515,235439089,2018-02-16,18017023,Bonnie,"This place is a dream!  From the first moment when we booked the cozy cottage months ago to checking out after our amazing stay, everything was perfect.  Erika and Blake have done an amazing job decorating and designing this space and the location could not be better.  Minutes away from one of the most beautiful beaches we've been to (this says a lot because I live in Orange County and use to live in Fiji) Pacific Grove is a slice of heaven.  The cottage is so cozy and the design and decor are straight out of a design magazine.  The bed was very comfortable and the cozy towels and bathrobe were so soft.  There were delicious cookies waiting for us upon arrival as well as local 805 beers, fruit, coffee, and breakfast items.  We spent a day exploring Monterey and Pacific Grove and a day in Big Sur.  Was so nice to get away and be in nature and then come back to the cottage and it's amazing coziness.  We would love to come back as we had such a special time and make amazing memories.  Restaurant recommendation in Big Sur- the restaurant called Sierra Mar in the Post Ranch Inn resort in Big Sur. Some pf the most spectacular views and food we've ever had.  Again, thank you Erika and Blake for allowing us to spend time in this gorgeous cottage by the sea!!!  xoxo Bonnie & Cleo"
44515,236251322,2018-02-18,20587300,Carolyn,"How I wish every AirB&B could be as amazing as Erika & Blake’s place. The cottage is exactly as represented. From the organic snacks in the fridge, fresh cookies waiting for us, and sparkling clean accommodations - our stay was better than I had hoped for. And that mattress! So very very comfy. Quiet neighborhood and very stylish place. Good parking. Erika was quick to respond to questions I had ahead of time, and was warm and welcoming on site. It was nice having access to the entire patio area, and also a private sitting area outside. We took a few walks to the beach. Literally, only 4-5 minutes away.  Five star stay all the way."
44515,236663463,2018-02-19,28346114,Beth,"This little cottage is perfect. It has everything you need for a cozy, comfortable time. It is very well designed, and has a location that can't be beat. The hosts are very welcoming. It was great to go to sleep to the sound of the surf, and wake to the sound of gentle rain. A wonderful oasis from all the hubbub of life, and I can't wait to return."
44515,237130691,2018-02-21,55789492,Morgan,Absolutely perfect place to stay for our time exploring the coast. Impeccably furnished cottage with amazing amenities. Would definitely recommend to anyone coming to the area and will stay here again in a heartbeat if we ever make it back to the area. Thanks for a great stay!
44515,238773343,2018-02-26,140957629,Pamela,What a special place with special hosts!  Perfect private beach just a few blocks away and they even provided beach chairs.  Stylish cottage with top-of-the-line furnishings and special touches.  Our first airbnb experience will be hard to beat!
44515,239428652,2018-03-01,70978741,Marilyn,"Just returned from another wonderful stay at Erika and Blake's amazing cottage. Perfect in every way - beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable, peaceful, and the location cannot be beat. It doesn't seem possible, but every time I return it is even nicer than the time before. I can't imagine better hosts than Erika and Blake!"
44515,239690642,2018-03-02,167012576,Jennifer,Erica and Blake have gone above and beyond! We were greeted by two delicious chocolate chip cookies waiting for us. Their recommendations were awesome and we had a great time. Thank you we will be back!
44515,242409503,2018-03-11,17981271,Kerry,Super studio in a lovely backyard. Loved the private patio!  Bed comfortable and many additional amenities provided. Erika was very responsive when we needed a plumber too.
44515,242914704,2018-03-13,48320936,Briana,"This place is a GEM. If you are lucky enough to snag it, I highly suggest you do. It's as beautiful as the pictures look and the calming and beautiful ambiance adds even more beauty to the whole experience. Erika and Blake couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. They had thought of everything down to their cookie recipe and we immediately felt at home. It was so clean, so pretty, and even smelled so nice. Plus, our pups were welcomed and played with their sweet dog, so we were able to get away as a full family. Thank you guys so much for the getaway and we hope to come back again sometime!"
44515,243665563,2018-03-16,14758075,Linsey,"This was my second visit to Erika & Blake's.  They've made the cottage even nicer with an updated kitchenette and bathroom. The cottage itself is so private and lovely, with the colors reflecting the colors of the sea and the ocean light.  It was snug, cozy and warm enjoying breakfast in the sitting area with the rain pattering outside in the mornings.  And when the sun shone, with the windows and door open, the air felt so fresh and invigorating.  Just what I needed before heading out to enjoy the so-close Asilomar Beach and the wonders of Point Lobos.  I've stayed at about a dozen Airbnbs now, and this one remains one of my favorites."
44515,244505623,2018-03-18,62233800,Amanda,"This cottage is amazing and adorable. The location couldn’t be better for exploring the coast and the special touches - from the decor, to the cookies and breakfast make it feel like you’re in luxury accommodations. We are looking for every excuse to come back soon!!"
44515,246077383,2018-03-24,59352828,Roberta,"Erica and Blake’s cottage is just perfect. It’s cozy and comfortable, well stocked close to the beach. Parking is easy. We’ll come back."
44515,246571280,2018-03-25,11878079,Mason,"This place is exceptional! It’s really close to ocean views (just a 3-4 minute walk), really quiet, and overall a really cute place with great amenities. The cottage has a kitchenette and Erika stocked it with goodies for us so that we actually ate enough for breakfast and lunch. Awesome place. We will be back again."
44515,248154656,2018-03-30,532883,Cam,"We stayed the last week of March, 2018.  We'd stayed previously a few years back and the cottage was as we remembered it.  The cottage is surprisingly roomy, light and airy, has first rate amenities and is dog friendly (including a private courtyard), as is the entire property.  It's a great walking neighborhood and the nearby beach is dog friendly.  We will return again."
44515,249174967,2018-04-01,19692831,Chris,"This place is everything you think it will be. We felt home immediately and really enjoyed the personal touches, location, and recommendations. Great jump off point to everything in the area. We'll be telling all of our friends about this place so if you want to book it, you better do it fast."
44515,250080850,2018-04-03,10149375,Anna,"Can't go wrong 0.3 miles from Asilomar beach. But the space is so lovely you almost don't want to leave - great design sense, lots of thoughtful touches including really nice shampoo & conditioner, organic coffee, all the breakfast fixins', and homemade chocolate chip cookies! And the little kitchen has everything you need to cook a full meal if you wanted to. We particularly enjoyed sitting on the private patio drinking some wine and soaking in the sun with our pups."
44515,250333675,2018-04-04,164520119,Camille,This is a great place to stay and if I ever come back to visit the area would definitely stay again.
44515,252918083,2018-04-12,5739652,Ulrike,Fantastic Location. Very quiet and private. Very comfortable king size bed.Hosts were very helpful.
44515,254068061,2018-04-15,62670028,Kate,Over exceeded our expectations! Everything about our stay at the cottage was perfect! One of our highlights was visits from Erika and Blakes little dog Walter-he was extremely friendly.
89210,229403,2011-04-17,509848,David,"We can’t say enough about Sara and Evan as hosts, they were incredibly friendly and gracious.--truly lovely people.  They made us feel as if there home was our home.  We couldn’t have felt more comfortable or taken care of.  

As for the cottage, it was spectacular, the perfect little get away home!  Everything is brand new, the room impeccably decorated, the bed so luxurious, the sight and sound of the Pacific Ocean right outside, the beautiful bathroom, with the option of an open air shower.  From the moment you set foot inside it is apparent that the cottage design and build was done with care and love.  It really is a magical experience.

We both have already recommended CA Dreaming to our friends and family and look forward to visiting again soon.

89210,236899,2011-04-23,345268,Nick,"My son Evan and I stayed at Sarah and Evan's California Dreaming room recently.  We were both in agreement (for once), that we loved the place.  It is a recently added addition to their home, with a very tastefully decorated interior.  If that wasn't enough, there is a great view of the Monterey Bay from the bedroom window.  I am a fellow AirBnB'er and own my own vacation rental in Monterey.  But when my place is not available, I know I will be calling Sarah and Evan up again.  Besides that, there are both great people.  Evan, Chippy (son's dog) and I felt right at home.  We all highly recommend their place.    "
89210,239975,2011-04-25,525041,Karen,"The humble exterior of the house was no indication of the wonderful room, gardens and view we were about to enjoy.  An unexpected pleasure for my musician husband was that another musician was also staying at the Baker's home.  We all enjoyed music, stories, wine and cheese and lots of laughs in the Baker's cozy living room.  The only thing that surpassed Sarah and Evan's hospitality was their down home, right on recommendations of where to find really tasty food and places to dance.  We danced 'til our legs hurt and ate 'til our tummies smiled. All in all this was a very relaxing and fun getaway and would stay again at our new friend's home of Sarah and Evan Baker.  PS The herbal info worked wonders, thanks again."
89210,244927,2011-04-29,538508,Tom," My wife and I had a wonderful stay in the California Dreaming Studio suite, a fantastic zen-style studio and garden area!  Sarah and Evan are great hosts. They really went the extra mile to make sure we had a comfortable stay. We got in late and needed to grab some dinner before the restaurants closed. Sarah found the perfect bistro for us close by. She even called ahead and made sure that they would be open when we got there. The Aquarium passes are a great value as well. We will definitely come back again when we visit Monterey/Pacific Grove again."
89210,248395,2011-05-02,52337,Mary,Lovely quiet accommodations. Will definitely recommend to friends.
89210,256808,2011-05-09,164103,Arvind,"Mohita, Kiran (our 2.5 yr old toddler) and I had a fantastic weekend stay at the CA dreaming space. The King+ size sleeping arrangements were plush, and it was nice to wake in the morning to the sight and sound of the distant ocean. The stand up shower with the skylights was an added bonus. Sarah and Evan were super nice hosts, and we felt quite at home. Sarah stirred up a quick Mac and cheese dinner for Kiran (yum!) and Evan drew us a nice map of local scenic attractions. Kiran had lots of fun playing with Zeus and collecting rocks/pebbles from Sarah's garden. Wonderful people, and beautiful accommodations. Highly recommend!"
89210,263442,2011-05-14,251214,Conrad,"My company generously put me up in an executive suite in a beautiful hotel all week, and the stay there was lovely, but the night at the end of that week we spent at Sarah and Evan's was even more lovely!  It had been an exhausting week, and my wife and I needed a calm, quiet, and refreshing night's rest, and that's just what we got there.  The room was exquisite, the view was breathtaking, and the hospitality unparalleled; and Zeus was an added, charming bonus.  If you're staying in the Monterey area, the California Dreaming Suite is the very best you can find.  I just wish I could keep it as my little secret, so that the next time we're in Monterey, the suite won't already be booked; but I guess I'll just have to plan way in advance."
89210,264863,2011-05-15,577396,John,Sarah and Evan were wonderful!  The California Dreaming cottage outside is beautiful and private and our hosts were extremely friendly!  My girlfriend and I loved it!
89210,265692,2011-05-16,503705,Lila,This family knows how to host.  Very fun first time experience using Airbnb.  Lovely view of the ocean and interesting conversation with tea.  The sky shower was a nice perk. 
89210,270174,2011-05-18,593634,Sagarika,"Sarah and Evan have a lovely room for guests. It's well lit and faces out to a gorgeous view of some trees and the ocean. Great shower too. Nice bath products in the bathroom. Cool collection of vinyl to go along with the record player in the walk in wardrobe space. I enjoyed snacking on the bowl of clementines in the room.

We came in one late evening and Sarah and Evan were warm and welcoming. We ended up chatting about life and things over tea till later that night, and Sarah even played us a lovely song she had written herself on her piano. Evan gave us good driving tips and sightseeing information, which we were glad for. 

We didn't expect breakfast the next morning but Sarah was nice enough to throw it in, which was lovely. 

Great conversation, warm and welcoming hosts, I would definitely stay at Sarah and Evan's again, and recommend you to too!"
89210,277147,2011-05-23,382885,John,"I spent the weekend in the Monterey area with an old friend of mine, a weekend that was made complete by Sarah and Evan's incredible bungalow overlooking Pacific Grove and the Pacific Ocean. From the backyard (and from the ultra-comfortable, king-sized bed inside the bungalow!), you can both see and hear the ocean. Check out the turntable in the bungalow, and Evan's awesome collection of vinyl, and play some music to enhance the stay. The skylight over the shower is a very nice touch, too. Seriously, even though the pictures look great here, they still don't do the place justice. It's even better than it looks online. Plus, Sarah and Evan both made sure that we had everything we needed and made us feel welcomed in their home, giving us run of the kitchen and really anything else we needed during our stay. Their place is about 5 minutes from the beautiful Asilomar Beach, 5 minutes from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and 10 minutes from Carmel. It's a perfect location and my only regret was that I couldn't stay longer. "
89210,288144,2011-05-30,554306,Christie,"We took our little doggy, Chloe and had a fabulous time staying here. Sarah & Evan were amazing and Sarah is a fantastic song writer/pianist/singer. We fell in love with Zeus. We spoiled him with our little Chloe's favorite blueberry treats so if he knocks on your door in the morning it is our fault :)"
89210,291969,2011-05-31,626284,Justin,"This was an awesome pace and Sarah/Evan were awesome hosts.  Very relaxing, the room had all the essentials, and the experience was awesome for my first time using airb2b.  

Will definately be looking to book this room in the future."
89210,307971,2011-06-11,557433,Richard,"My wife and I were looking for a week of relaxation and we found it with California Dreaming. The room was perfect, roomy with a view of the ocean from the plush, comfy bed. The hosts, Sara and Evan, were a very nice surprise.  Very welcoming and friendly. We've decided we will need a week at California Dreaming at least once a year. Thank you Sara and Evan!"
89210,311037,2011-06-13,472412,Elizabeth,This is a very nice space - it is so comfortable and cute. The record player is a real bonus. We used the Wizard of Oz as entertainment for the kids. They loved it. We also enjoyed lots of music.The mandarins upon arrival was a nice touch. We were able to come and go out of the main house and Sarah and Evan were very helpful with suggestions of what to do in the area and where to eat. Opening the window at the top of the shower as a natural fan was lovely. The sofa was fine for our 3 year old to sleep in. We would recommend this place to others. The hosts are very friendly and welcoming.
89210,315885,2011-06-15,363368,Kirsty,"This was our 1st Airbnb experience and it's going to be hard to beat. Sahra and Evan are so warm and generous, their home is inviting and their dog Zeus is a legend! Not too mention the Evan designed Cali Dreaming Suite... the bed and shower are so luxurious, but even better is the record player and stash of retro vinyl for you to play with, genius idea... We went to sleep with a bit of Joni and woke up with some Woodstock, how awesome is that?!
You must stay here!!!"
89210,320759,2011-06-18,622423,Michael,"Thank you so much for your hospitality and your great place. We loved it and cannot find a better audience for our little music performances. It was every bit as we dreamed and more!

Michael and Lulu"
89210,330101,2011-06-23,615244,Melanie,"Sarah and Evan were great hosts! The suite was in a great location, clean, comfortable and possible the nicest  shower I've ever experienced. I would recommend this suite to anyone and will stay again when in the area!"
89210,336893,2011-06-27,528752,Daphne,"This was the best hosting experience we have had in YEARS!!!  Sara was such a joy to be with, and she treated us like friends (rather than mere renters.)  The California Dreaming room was amazing, just as it appears in the photos.  

But it was Sara's warmth and hospitality that made this an unforgettable experience.  Too many people who run B&Bs and inns nowadays do so as a business, and have become cold and business-like.  Not Sara:  she clearly enjoys and relishes her role as host, and makes her guests feel right at home.  

We have already recommended California Dreaming to several friends, and will continue to do so.  And we can't wait to come back!"
89210,350480,2011-07-03,375975,Terra & Chris,My son Quinn and I staying in Sarah and Evan's CA Dreaming suite for a night this past week.  It was extremely comfortable and quite with all the amenities.  Sarah's warmth and hospitality made me feel like we were staying with an old friend.  Highest of marks for the accommodations and even higher for the host! 
89210,356251,2011-07-06,547395,Chris,"Sarah and Zeus, her dear, three-legged dog, were wonderful hosts.  (Her husband, Evan, was away.)  The room was charming, the bathroom eco-friendly and trendy, and the bed most comfy.  We really appreciated the free tickets to the Monterey Aquarium, a must-see!"
89210,361103,2011-07-08,281615,Simon,"Absolutely wonderful place - can't recommend it highly enough. Super-relaxed, and Sarah, Evan and Zeus (the dog) are wonderful hosts.

Bed is comfy - and the shower is astounding!

Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to stay when visiting Pacific Grove!"
89210,366036,2011-07-11,422240,Bryan,"Sarah and Evan were fantastic. Fun, friendly and respectful of our time and space. The accommodations were charming, comfortable, clean and very relaxing. Stay here if you want to be in the middle of 17 mile drive, Pebble Beach, Monterey and Carmel. Fun, Fun. And thanks Sarah for being so gracious to Galinda our 1yr old black lab..;)  "
89210,372624,2011-07-14,723495,Sun Sook,"This is a really homey place. I had a wonderful time :)
Thank Sarah and Evan!"
89210,376702,2011-07-16,387770,Peter,"We couldnt have asked for friendlier hosts and a better place to stay.
Sarah and Evan are lovely people and gave us some great tips to explore the area. Our bed was possibly the most comfortable we have ever slept on and the furnishings and bathroom were exceptional.

Our only regret is that we didnt have enough time to take their little dog Zeus a walk along the beach!"
89210,385137,2011-07-20,666992,Lizzy,"Amazing people to stay with.  When they say use their house like your own they truly mean it!  They are both very generous and caring people with an excellent knowledge, which they openly share, of the local area's best eateries and shops.  The actual accommodation is wonderful with a an ambiance of tranquility and peace to relax and unwind you.   The bed is an absolute dream, so comfortable and cosy that you may not want to get out of it.  Finally the area is peaceful and a perfect distance away from town which in itself is wonderful to be in"
89210,389094,2011-07-22,438102,Silka,"We had an amazing time!!! It was so peaceful and cozy. Also - all their recommendations were great. Definitely check out point lobos and the aquarium. Had the best sleep in that bed. It was a very romantic, relaxing two days! "
89210,397749,2011-07-26,94711,Martha,"California Dreaming is beautiful, comfortable, freshly done. Colors and textures are enchanting.
As it worked out our group of 2 expanded to 4 and we needed more room. Sarah and Evan agreeably switched us to the main house to better accommodate us.  We enjoyed the use of two lovely adjacent rooms and slept great!
We felt so warmly welcome by our hosts. It was much a spiritual retreat. Morning coffee at the dining room table. Comfortable conversation with Sarah and Evan and their other guests whenever we wanted to touch base.
It is located not far from Laguna Seca Raceway and Monterey. Be sure to see the jellies and the sea horses at the Monterey Aguarium. 
We highly recommend!!"
89210,422930,2011-08-06,506708,Lisa,"Thanks sooo much to Sara, Evan & Zeus for a wonderful few nights in their accommodation! It was immaculate, so modern and the bed was so comfortable! They were such lovely hospitable people and made us feel at home. Zeus (their little doggy) was super cute and was very friendly. (Even more friendly when we pulled out the bacon strips for him!). We travelled from San Francisco down to Las Vegas stopping off en route and we can honestly say our favourite place was Pacific Grove! The accommodation was in a great location. We would definately love to return one day. Thanks again!!"
89210,431371,2011-08-09,425391,Debbie,"Everything about our stay with Sarah and Evan was Zenfully wonderful.  They were the perfect hosts - they gave you all the privacy or company you preferred.  The suite was exquisite, and the view divine.  
You felt you'd known Sarah and Evan forever - like your favorite slippers. very comortable.  Sarah sings like a nightengale too.
We will definitely be back for a longer stay.  You would be very lucky to be guests in this home.  This was our very first experience with Airnb, and it was special.
Tom and Debbie, Aug 2011"
89210,449843,2011-08-16,773681,Erin,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Monterey- in large part due to the hospitality provided by Evan and Sarah.  They make every effort to let you feel at home and graciously shared their vinyl collection.  Make sure you take advantage of the Aquarium passes!
89210,468474,2011-08-23,523738,Chris,"Wonderful people.  Newly remodeled, cute, quiet and very comfortable.  With its private entrance private also.  Patio has view of ocean if it is ever not foggy.  Got along without it but would have enjoyed TV.  All in all a great place and really nice people."
89210,476313,2011-08-26,801143,Melissa,What great hosts!  Room was clean and cozy and in a great location.
89210,480043,2011-08-27,393221,Justin,"A truly stunning room in a very quiet but picturesque location. Evan was the perfect host, willing to help with any required information and with plenty of stories to share. I would happily stay there again and recommend it to anybody else!"
89210,484226,2011-08-29,86631,Lori,"Hello,
We enjoyed the warm hospitality and the Monterey Aquarium guest passes. Our 3 legged Mexi-mutt got to hang out with his new friend and soul mate, Zeus - another 3 legged rescue dog. SO cute!

The bed was very comfy - and the setting  conducive to a relaxing vacation.  Thank you, Kevin!"
89210,489400,2011-08-30,175251,Samuel,"Evan is a great host, with great communication !  He made everything very easy for me, my wife and our baby. The room was very clean and very well-prepared. I would definitely stay there again !"
89210,490305,2011-08-31,418081,Paolo,"We didn't meet Sarah, unfortunately. 
Evan was really nice. He offered us a glass of white wine when we arrived in the apartment and the day after he gave us two free member passes for the Monterey Aquarium. He was full of good informations about the places in the area, that we followed.
The apartment is nice and intimate, with a beautifull little garden with a ocean view.
A good experience that I suggest to everyone.
"
89210,492563,2011-09-01,809529,Thomas,"We stayed at Sarah and Evan's for our last night of our vacation in CA. It could not have been more perfect, arriving late in the afternoon, we spend a wonderful evening together with lots of great and interesting talk. The room (the bed!!!!!) is absolutely fabulous, wish we could have stayed longer... Thanks to Sarah and Evan, truly wonderful hosts!"
89210,505196,2011-09-06,604481,Betsy,"Evan and Sarah were wonderful hosts.  They gave us some great advice on a delicious vegetarian restaurant, local parking, and the best way to enjoy the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  They really helped make our weekend a great experience. Thank you!"
89210,510205,2011-09-07,465732,Sarah,"Sarah, Evan and Zeus are wonderful hosts, just what you want from an Airbnb experience. They were warm, welcoming and gave lots of advice on the local area and on San Francisco too. The room is clean, the bed is really comfortable and there's a quirky record collection to keep you entertained much better than a tv. The location is good for travelling on Highway 1 between San Francisco and Big Sur."
89210,514745,2011-09-08,830880,Florian,"We had an awesome time at Sarahs and Evans.
The welcome was very lovely and we even got offered drinks to be taken right on the terrace with a nice view in the late afternoon sun :) what a great start after a long trip on Highway 1.

We would have loved to stay longer, but as we have been on a roadtrip on Highway 1 we could just stay so shortly.

The location is just wonderful. Up the hill with a nice view (if not foggy).

Sarah and Evan provided great tips what to do and where to eat. We had the best dinner(s) on our tour! Ask them for recommendations! It is worth it ;)

We had a great day and would have loved to stayed longer. 

The aquarium tix for free are perfect and should close your decision for Sarah and Evan!
Believe me, you want to stay with them ;)

Thanks Sarah and Evan that we could stay with you! It was really lovely.

Florian & Sebastian

89210,522935,2011-09-12,802156,Spencer,Great spot....we were very pleased...we will return...Thanks
89210,545577,2011-09-19,963079,Stacy,"Beautiful room! Great hosts! The room was 5 minutes from the aquarium and 15 minutes from the racetrack.  We will definitely be staying with Sarah and Evan again if we can.  Sarah gave us some wonderful restaurant recommendations too.  We took advantage of the record player and the view in the afternoons/evening. 

It was worth every penny!

"
89210,560657,2011-09-23,1158445,Judy,"Very helpful, congenial hosts. The guest room we had is comfortable & attractive. The setting is a private home with guest accommodations in a residential area away from busy-ness but a short drive from everywhere you might want to go."
89210,564942,2011-09-25,877110,Eva,"The things that matter aren't (Website hidden by Airbnb) it says on Sahra's bumper sticker, and that is so true!
The house is a cosy nest and our heavenly studio in the garden was an oase of wellbeing...
But these things would have meant nothing without the presence of Sahra and Evin, two wonderfull human beings with a beautiful soul that shines thru their eyes and captures you from the minute you walk into their world. It felt like coming home to beloved ones and we hated to go."
89210,571508,2011-09-26,1153461,Nealeigh,"I can't say enough about how charming this little bungalow is and how romantic the weekend was.

The room is spotlessly clean, spacious, a record collection that can't be topped and a really unique walk in shower. 

I wish Sarah and Evan were my (home away from home) parents. They greeted us with such warmth, gave us great activity suggestions (not tourist-y), and shared a lovely morning chat over fresh coffee.

We're coming again and staying more than one night. It's just not enough. Even my 30+ pics of the room and outdoor area won't suffice.

GO! but don't book the days we want to return. :)"
89210,579659,2011-09-28,934207,Marta,"5 stars are way to less to describe our stay with Sahra and Evan!! They are wonderful people, wonderful hosts and we regret that we did not stay longer!! 

The bed is so comfortable that you don´t want to get out (with ocean view), but if you do the best shower on earth welcomes you. And then you have another problem: you just don´t want to stop showering :) Sahra and Evan are really wonderful!! We highly recommend to stay at their place!!! Best thing you can do!!!!!"
89210,587662,2011-10-01,1206973,Fernando,"Great, very enjoyable experience. Sarah and Evan made us feel like personal friends / guests, and went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at their place. The room & bathroom are immaculate and very comfortable (shower with sunroof is unique!). There is a yard right outside of the bedroom with a great view. The location of the house, between Monterey and Carmel, is very convenient, with fast and easy access to both places. Sarah took the time to tell us the best places to visit, and had great recommendations on where to have dinner, etc. Last but not least, the Aquarium tickets that they provide are a good bonus, it's a very interesting visit.
Five stars because there is not a 6 star category on Airbnb rating!"
89210,592447,2011-10-03,985668,Rulya,"We wanted to spend our short weekend at a quite place where we can relax and have fun at the same time. We did have a lot of fun and some more. The house was very pretty and clean. It felt like we were taken care of. They thought about every single detail. They were very kind to provide us a list of places to visit, eat and enjoy. Even free pass to aquarium and let's don't forget the delicious tomatos and their fine records collection. We hope to find a chance soon to be their guest again. It was like a dream. Superb hospitality."
89210,604107,2011-10-06,1167082,Astrid,"Sarah and Evan are wonderful, sympathetic, and warm hosts. They really make you feel at home. We had some nice conversations with them and they gave us some good advice on dining and interesting places. (We did visit Point Lobos!) As an extra, we found out that Sarah has great qualities as a singer/songwriter. 
We loved little Zeus.The room with oceanview is great, very private, with a supercomfortable bed and a perfectly designed shower in beautiful colours. The location is very good and no one should miss seeing The Aquarium. It's a pity we only had one day in Monterey. We highly recommend a stay at Sarah and Evans place!"
89210,608980,2011-10-08,1176556,JoAnn,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been any better.  Sarah, Evan, and Zeus welcomed my family and small dog into their home and we felt at ease immediately.  They helped us plan out what to do and where to dine during our stay.  The room was very comfortable - I loved the shower with the window on the ceiling.  Very nice couple who obviously love to meet new people and share their home.  Definitely will return."
89210,615212,2011-10-10,1177502,Cris,"The hosts, Sarah and Evan are very welcoming and accommodating. The suite itself is super comfortable, very clean and comfortable. Great views of the pacific coast. Nice alternative to traditional hotel accomodations. Thanks to Evan and Sarah! "
89210,631940,2011-10-16,1178728,Donald,"We had been on the road / planes or a couple of weeks - seeing loads of great stuff.  We needed a break and CA Dreaming fitted the bill perfectly.  Sarah and Evan were warm, relaxed hosts and we didn't feel uncomfortable at all in sharing their house and facilities for the two nights we were there.  Plus, they allowed our 5 and 7 yo to play with a pile of toys - which was a lovely touch.  I  particularly loved the old vinyl collection!"
89210,637815,2011-10-17,1212549,Julie,"We all had a wonderful visit!!  Evan and Sarah are great hosts and very helpful with suggestions.  Comfortable and clean.  Amazing shower.  
Thank you both!!  "
89210,652542,2011-10-22,1165455,Nathan & Alyona,"Sarah and Evan's place is very special. It has a lot of character and you just wish your own place would be that cozy and styly. Also it's immaculately clean!
Sarah called a few days before the stay to arrange the logistics of our stay. She was friendly and helpful. It's been great that we could use the aquarium tickets, well worth the visit. 
We didn't get a chance to personally meet Sarah and Evan, but would certainly come back to their place if it was available next time we go to Monterrey."
89210,662372,2011-10-25,1035664,Andrew And Jina,Couldn't have been better!! Sarah and Evan are welcoming and gracious.  They are genuine folks who fully opened up their home and provided a beautiful private living space for us to use.  Their little dog is friendly and their recommendation for dinner (Julia's) was outstanding.  Monterey and surrounding area is a great place to spend some time and they are perfect hosts.  We wish we could have spent more time with them. 
89210,682527,2011-11-01,453162,Maria,"Thank you so much for making our stay in the Monterey Bay area so lovely! We thoroughly enjoyed meeting you and staying in your lovely home (oh, the ocean view from the bedroom..! You don't get that in London!). The restaurant recommendations you provided were spot on. Thank you! Rich & Maria"
89210,690686,2011-11-03,98912,Jess,"Sarah and Evan's place was a peaceful and beautiful getaway. They are charming hosts with lots of tips and reccs on the area. 

I highly recommend their studio. The bed is enormous and fluffy and sleeping in it makes you feel like royalty. Waking up to the beautiful view of the water is the icing on the cake. Their record collection is an unexpected detour that provides hours of listening entertainment. Last but certainly not least, the bathroom, with open air shower (window you can choose to open)makes for a spa-like experience. You can marvel at the stars or enjoy the fresh morning breezes -- either way, it makes you want to shower as often as possible! Almost forgot to mention the incredible generous perk of Aquarium passes. Don't miss it! "
89210,692367,2011-11-04,710575,Gregory,"Thanks so much Sarah and Evan for the stories and recommendations, and what a beautiful room! Nepenthe was indeed beautiful, the aquarium was wonderful, and we felt very welcome and glad to spend the night. Thanks!"
89210,705736,2011-11-09,527774,Helynn,Sarah and Evan are awesome.  So kind and accommodating. I got sick before my trip and couldn't make it and they were very sweet about understanding. Sarah and I talked on the phone for quite some time during my trip planning and it was like talking to an old friend.  Great people.   Will definitely be rescheduling my trip. 
89210,711084,2011-11-12,1201411,Ellen (& Stuart),"CA Dreaming was ... dreamy! A lovely comfortable room with a Jananese Zen vibe and ocean views made the perfect setting for listening to Sarah and Evan's suberb record collection. Carol King, Joni Mitchel, Dire Straits, Cat Stevens ... and the room is sound proof so you can sing like no-one is listening. Sarah and Evan were delightful hosts; very easy to spend time with and full of great suggestions for local adventures. The bathroom is great and the location superb. Highly recommended."
89210,718110,2011-11-14,272913,Erika  & Dave," We had a great weekend at Sarah and Evan's lovely home.  Dave arrived later, which gave me some time to get to know Sarah -- a very warm, funny, and talented person who is also an inspiration on living life fully. Evan was also a gracious host -- and, he actually built the beautiful bungalow where we stayed. What a serene spot, decorated in gorgeous fabrics and colors, with an amazing bed, cascading water fountain, decadent shower, and ocean view! We were delighted to bribe the charming Zeus with doggie treats, even though he didn't reciprocate. Nonetheless we felt we had become friends. And with Sarah and Evan too, and we didn't even have to bribe them : )  So happy to make your three - and - two - legged acquaintances.  Best wishes and thanks for everything!"
89210,741326,2011-11-24,1267372,Marcus,"Evan and Sarah were wonderful hosts!  We first met Evan and Zeus after traveling all day up the Pacific Coast Highway.  Intuiing that we were probably hungry, Evan had a fantastic restaurant recommendation for us -- amazing food and not too far away either.  Coming back to the room after diiner was perfect.  Everything was clean, and there was such a great sense of peacefulness.  Waking up in the morning was a true treat -- the sound of a water fountain in the room, a view of the ocean from the bed, and sunlight coming in through the windows.  Another nice little treat was the record player in the room whichmMy fiance and I made sure to play some records while we got ready in the mornings and when we hung out in the evenings.  Great selection of records to choose from too!  I would recommend staying with Sarah and Evan to any of my friends and family, and I look forward to staying with them again in the future."
89210,754592,2011-11-29,1423748,Elaine,"We had a delightful stay with Sarah and Evan. It was relaxing and low key and it felt like we were staying with friends. Such nice people. The experience is just as described: Zeus will meet you at the door and ask you for treats, the bungalow is extremely comfortable, warm and fun and the location is really convenient. We had fun playing with the old records. Loved the shower and organic products! Really glad Sarah recommend Julies for dinner. The vegetarian dinner was so fresh, delicious and affordable. An unforgettable experience!"
89210,790886,2011-12-18,1215573,Chenghao,"My wife and I stayed at Evan's place for 2 nights. Privacy was not an issue as the bedroom with an attached bathroom was in an extension separate from the main house.

The room was decorated in a simple oriental style making in welcoming, homely and peaceful. The bed was simply luxurious. The highlight of this neat place would be the bathroom. It is lit by skylight,  spacious and would put most 5 star hotel bathroom to shame.  

Thanks Sarah and Evans for sharing your simple abode with us. This place is highly recommended!!!"
89210,795920,2011-12-20,1415756,Shelley,Sarah and Evan are amazing!  We took our dogs and explored the area every day...we couldn't have asked for nicer hosts.  We felt right at home in CA Dreaming. It really was like staying at a spa! The skylit shower and vinyl record collection made for great memories.  We'll definitely go back....only this time for a longer stay!  
89210,799342,2011-12-22,851119,Titus And Staci,"We didn't want to leave!  Sarah and Evan were incredible hosts, and made us feel so welcome.  We loved the record player and the shower with a skylight.  They had coffee ready for us in the morning, fantastic dining recommendations, and aquarium passes!  All in all, the perfect place to stay, we hope to return!"
89210,816538,2011-12-31,1180346,Chris,"Sarah and Evin were amazing hosts. We were not an easy group -- six adults and two infants -- but they were incredibly flexible and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable for us and safe for our kids. They found us booster chairs/high chairs for our babies and let us ship some necessities (diapers, naturally) ahead so we wouldn't have to worry about bringing them or finding them ourselves after a long day of travel. Their home is lovely and we all had a wonderful time. If you're traveling to the Carmel/Pebble/PG area, you need look no further."
89210,830894,2012-01-03,1379125,Monika,"Such an amazing Place of Peace and harmony! Sarah and Evan are inspirational friendly hosts. We had a great New years Eve with them, sitting in the comfortable kitchen looking at the Ocean. The Rooms are comfortable, we all slept very good with hearing the Oceanbreeze. The landscape of monteray is amazing! We saw a lot of whales and had a outstanding Time in the Aquarium. We would have loved to stay longer!"
89210,846750,2012-01-07,1094301,Kristiarne,"Well what can we say about Ca (Website hidden by Airbnb) was just so awesome! Sarah and Evan we miss you already!!! We could not recommend such kind and generous hosts! This space and the people left a great memory for us and our adventure! The space they have built for there air-bnb guests is incredible and you can feel the heart and love that has gone into the space when you enter. The highlight off the CA Dreaming is definitely the shower...with open sky views straight to the moon and the record player to get a bit off appropriate atmosphere going! its truly a relaxing, cosy and peaceful space! and the morning view off the beach just adds to that feeling..... Evan, Sarah and their family we fell in love with, and by the end we forgot that we were there guests, and felt more like old friends visiting, thanks so much guys for that experience that added another level to our trip! xoxo"
89210,866625,2012-01-16,1572898,Afton,"This review is a bit delayed, but we LOVED staying with Evan & Sarah, such gracious and friendly hosts, a beautiful little cottage, aquarium tickets--and a view of the ocean! Doesn't get much better. 

Evan and Sarah immediately put us at ease when we walked up, and they have an awesome 3-legged pup, named Zeus. They also permitted us to bring our enormous dog, Eugene, which was great. The cottage is brand-new, eco-friendly, quiet and extremely comfy. The shower with open-air option is fab! They also have a record player with ~100 records, which we thought was a GREAT touch we really appreciated. 

Really nice hosts, we were sad that we had to get on the road and didn't have the chance to sit down to breakfast. Definitely the BEST option if you want to have a nice weekend at the aquarium, thanks guys!

Best,
Mark & Afton Moss (and Eugene!)"
89210,875785,2012-01-22,1397295,Jacqueline,"We had a wonderful week with Evin and Sarah, went out to a vegetarian dinner with them, met some good friends, attended a yoga class together and had many good conversations.  They were wonderful hosts and made our anniversary trip very special!  Their dog got along well with our dog who is not too socially adept.  We all enjoyed the visit.  Thanks!"
89210,879009,2012-01-23,1590805,Larry,Nice place to stay.  Centrally located to Monterey Bay and all the towns around it.  Great deal when you include the aquarium tickets.  Both Evan and Sarah were very helpful about the area and restaurants.
89210,883016,2012-01-25,1597231,Filippo,"Absolutely an amazing experience! This was our first night in a AirBnb location and we couldn't be more happy about it.
Evan is a charming and interesting person, the room and the bathroom are amazing, (the bed is the most comfortable ever!) and our only regret is that we spent only one night there!"
89210,890086,2012-01-30,1448865,Adam,"What great people! The minute we arrived Sarah and Evan made us feel completely welcome in their home! We felt like we'd made good friends by the end of the first day.

The bungalo is beautiful with a funky yard and a nice view of the ocean. You'll feel quite magical staying here.

In fact, you'd be crazy not to stay here with this wonderful couple!"
89210,911094,2012-02-09,1672661,Carmel,"Our stay with Sarah and Evan in their California Dreaming Suite was exceptional. It is really nice accomodation and we couldn't fault it. It is peaceful, comfortable, spotlessly clean, spacious and stylish.
It has everything you could expect or need and more.
The location is nice, a good , laid back neighbourhood, very quiet. It is very conveniently located for touring Big Sur, Carmel, Monterey, Pacific Grove and easily accessible to all the driving routes.
The Garden which the suite opens on to is very pretty and peaceful with a lovely view out to the ocean.
Sarah and Evan are very gracious and hospitable. They really looked after us on our stay and gave us great advice and tips. 
They made us feel very welcome and very relaxed in their home and we could not have been more comfortable there. They are also very smart and interesting people and we enjoyed their company whenever we met them.
Zeus the Dog is lovely, very cute and very good, wish I had a dog like him he really is adorable :)
We won't forget our stay with Sarah and Evan in their lovely home and have been telling our friends all about them since we got home. 
 10/10 , 5 stars etc. etc.  :-)"
89210,920673,2012-02-14,470608,Mark,"Great time in Monterrey (Pacific Grove)...pictures tell the story...Sarah and Evan are great (Website hidden by Airbnb) much privacy as we wanted...but also available for chats, tea, and directions...the bed is super comfortable...spacious bathroom and shower...and 60's albums on the record player...Aquarium tickets are a great bonus...good restaurants and shopping close by...just a fantastic getaway to Northern California...thanks again Sarah and Evan!!!"
89210,930229,2012-02-19,1494586,Eckhard,just an fantastic place with wonderful hosts.we will come again because the room is so nice and quiet and we had great dreams.evan helped us a lot with very good informations and together with sarah they are interesting and very openminded persons.
89210,936682,2012-02-21,1576424,Jono,"It's a fabulous place to stay -- gorgeous view, comfortable bed, large warm shower, quiet surroundings, and a record player in the room. Beyond that, the whole cottage is just overall a relaxing place to spend time, and Evan and Sarah really helped us to maximize the time, pointing out good places to eat, and suggesting a long hike along the coast, too. I can't recommend it highly enough."
89210,948302,2012-02-26,1212008,Colleen,We felt very welcome and comfortable at Evan and Sarah's home.  They are very generous souls.  The bungalow was exactly as described and really lovely.  I sat outside at night and looked at the stars and listened to the waves.  We were lucky - we had incredible weather. 
89210,951428,2012-02-27,1473720,Andreas,"We stayed at this place in February 2012 for 2 nights and everything was just great. The hosts including Zeus, the view, the bed, the appartement, just everything. Would really recommend it. Would also recommend the aquarium in Monterey, especially the jellyfish, the sea horses and sea dragons, the kelp forest and the place called Open Sea. Also, Sarah had nice suggestions for dinner and breakfast like the Hula and the Lighthouse Cafe. Thanks so much, Andreas & Stefanie."
89210,965437,2012-03-02,1805137,Christopher,"Adorable place.  Great view.  Good company.  Friendly, sweet-natured little dog. ***Hosts were understanding of (have past experience with)  cross-contamination concerns of a Celiac.  "
89210,967696,2012-03-03,1456236,Julia,"Staying in Sarah and Evan`s studio was a fantastic experience. The space is tranquil and zen like, with a beautiful patio and the view of the ocean. You have a feeling of floating high above all the busy-ness of the world. The shower has a huge skylight above it, and is an experience, not just a shower! The bed is out of this world and I had the best sleep ever...I wanted to take it with me lol. Sarah and Evan are the nicest people you`ll ever meet. They let me use their kitchen whenever I needed to and made me feel very welcome. Their three-legged dog Zeus is adorable, and we became good buddies. Sarah and Evan are very knowledgeable about all the best places to visit in and around Monterey. I highly recommend this place, and will definitely return the next chance I get."
89210,975381,2012-03-06,221746,Emily,"Warm and welcoming, Sarah and Evan are great hosts and lovely people.  We enjoyed talking with them and staying in their beautiful place.  The shower and the record player put it over the top."
89210,1002360,2012-03-15,1234287,Paul,"Sarah and Evan have created a lovely oasis for their guests. The ocean and garden view from the bedroom is gorgeous, the furnishings are lovely, shower is great, and the bed is very comfortable. If you travel with a lot of gear, as we do, you will appreciate the ample closet space. We are used to total privacy and having to share the kitchen with our hosts was a bit inconvenient for us at first, but Sarah and Evan are so warm and personable that sharing their space turned out to be a big plus instead of a minus. Their dog Zeus is also a sweetheart."
89210,1031261,2012-03-22,1647028,Leonie,"Unbelievable experience! The hosts Evan and Sahra could not have been more wonderful. They were generous, kind, sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. Instead of taking us into their home, they embraced us and were like family. They were also fantastic with our kids :-)
We explored most of their recommendations for hikes, restaurants, shops etc and every one was an A+ hit. We just ran out of time! The home was cozy, tidy, and amazingly decorated. The rooms were pristine clean, soft sheets, warm coverings, and lots of pillows! We wish we could have stayed a month instead of a week, and are already planning on visiting them again in the future. 
Hint: Ask Sahra, who is a singer/songwriter to do a song for you, she is fantastic! "
89210,1067112,2012-04-01,638768,David,"Wow!  What an amazing time and couple!  Evan and Sarah welcomed my wife and I (and our two Burmese cats) into their home with open arms.  In fact, not only did we feel incredibly welcomed and comfortable but they also enriched our lives. It is not every day that one meets such wonderful, kind, and genuine people like Sarah and Evan. They were the consummate hosts!

Their bungalow was so comfortable, cozy, and peaceful. And their sweet dog, Zeus, just added to the charm of the whole experience. We can't wait to go back. "
89210,1072741,2012-04-02,1835214,Ognen,"We had a lovely stay that made us wish it was longer! After years of being avid couchsurfers, this was our first Air BnB experience and we really enjoyed it.  Sarah was a wonderful host, as personable, helpful, and welcoming as any couchsurfer (which pleasantly surprised us considering that AIr BnB is a commercial enterprise while couchsurfing is not). She had some great tips for Monterey, our scenic drive back to San Francisco, and even for tea shops up in SF itself ;-). The cottage is also lovely and we had a great night's sleep after a tiring day and wedding that we attended. The Acquarium tickets are a nice plus. We unfortunately didn't meet Evan but he seemed like a nice guy in the few emails we exchanged.  "
89210,1087048,2012-04-05,1210193,Zoltan,"Sarah and Evan are very friendly,warm people.
The room was comfortable,cozy with great view.We'd like to come back in the near future for longer stay.
We absolutely recommend Sarah & Evan's place to anyone who's looking for a calm,relaxing stay in Monterey."
89210,1096247,2012-04-08,86435,Amber,"My two young children and I were lucky enough to spend 3 wonderful nights in Sarah and Evan's wonderful cottage.  The space was beautiful and inspiring, as were the hosts themselves!  I truly hope we have another opportunity to stay with them.  What a joyful experience.  :) "
89210,1104566,2012-04-10,1993943,Michelle,"Our family had a wonderful, relaxing time at Sarah and Evan's place. Our Host was thoughtful and helpful.  The room more than exceeded our expectation with it's huge California King size bed and another day bed for our three year-old.  The use of their Monterey Aquarium tickets alone made the stay worthwhile, as well as the helpful advice related of the local dining opportunities.  Definately a place worth returning to."
89210,1124098,2012-04-13,1851636,Laurel,"We loved our stay at CA Dreaming.  Sara and Evan were extremely nice, helpful, and easy-going.  The room itself was wonderful.  Great views of the ocean from the room, bed, and patio, tastefully decorated, comfortable bed, and very cool bathroom.  Our stay couldn't have been more perfect. "
89210,1135303,2012-04-16,1680713,Emily,"We had a wonderful time this weekend at CA Dreaming! The incredibly comfy king bed with a view of the ocean is reason enough to go. It was the perfect spot for a weekend away - Sarah is lovely (Evan wasn't around this weekend, but he sounds great too!) and gave us great recommendations for restaurants and activities. They are located very close to downtown Pacific Grove, Monterey, the Aquarium, the beach, everything...The bungalow is fantastic - cozy, warm, romantic. We could have spent hours just laying in that huge bed, doing the crossword and looking at the ocean. The bathroom is also beautiful - the shower with its skylight was one of the best I've taken! And of course, we loved Zeus, the amazing and sweet 3-legged dog! We would definitely come back! "
89210,1143182,2012-04-17,736188,Rebecca,"What a great little guest house. Simply and beautifully adorned, cozy and relaxing with a great view. Sahra was such a great host, and took the time to chat with us and give some great tips for the rest of our trip.  The aquarium passes were such a great bonus! "
89210,1152459,2012-04-19,1637329,Jane,"We loved this place!  Sarah was warm, available and helpful, and the accommodations were fantastic.  Beautifully designed, comfortable, tasteful and special - attention to detail - loved the record player and the vintage lp collection, the great bathroom, comfortable bed, and gorgeous setting.  Worth a trip back to California just to stay again."
89210,1166433,2012-04-23,1620245,Lory,"This is a rating for the Blue Room where my parents stayed! Beautfiul room tucked away in the main house. Cozy and with access to bathroom, and kitchen! Gave flexibility to our stay as my family and I were in the bungalow adjacent to the main house!

Lovely home with lots of artsy touches, beautiful open window setting with view of ocean and lots of outdoor garden space for lounging! 

Enjoyed our stay, Sarah was a great hostess!"
89210,1190382,2012-04-28,1710358,Lee,"Sarah and Evan's home was lovely and peaceful. We had an amazing room with an ocean view and a walk out onto a nice patio surrounded by beautiful gardens.
Sarah was a warm and inviting hostess who made us feel right at home. She gave us some tips on what sites were a must to see and ideas of places to visit and quaint restaurants that we would not have  found otherwise.
We would not hesitate to recommend a stay with Sarah and Evan.
"
89210,1245667,2012-05-08,1757895,Robyn,"Spectacular! The bungalow is serene, the garden and ocean view is beautiful. Sarah and Evan are charming, gracious and knowledgeable- ask for their advice on local restaurants and hikes.We hope to return again soon."
89210,1288943,2012-05-16,1581935,Ericka,"We had such a wonderful and relaxing vacation at Sarah and Evan's cute place in Pacific Grove. This was better than anything we could have gotten at a hotel and well worth the price. The natural latex bed with wool topper was so comfortable that we had trouble getting out of it.  There's a large walk-in closet with plenty of room for luggage and hanging clothes. The record player and old albums are a blast from the past, and we enjoyed sipping wine while perusing the collection. A large sliding glass door opens to the patio and a distant view of the Pacific ocean.  The large walk-in shower with sunroof and recycled granite walls topped off the experience.  

Sarah and Evan are great hosts and provided lots of useful information on hiking and places to eat. Their helpfulness and friendliness made our stay even more special. We'd definitely come back again. Our place was spotless and they even provided filtered water and coffee/tea from their kitchen. We were also able to store some food in their refrigerator. 

Concerning the area, Pacific Grove is a charming little town with lots of quaint Victorian houses. By car, the town center is only a few minutes away. We spent most of our time walking the coastal trail to Monterey and out to Asilomar Beach. It's absolutely stunning scenery teaming with life. We saw sea lions, seals, pelicans, dolphins (Big Sur) and even Orca (along Lover's Point)! If you're up for a challenge, I recommend the Andrew Molera Loop (9 mi), along the coast of Big Sur. But, there are lots of other wonderful hikes and Evan can provide information on these places. Also, a good website to visit is (Website hidden by Airbnb) 

TIPS:
- If you hike, dress to protect from ticks and Poison Oak. 
- The local vegetarian restaurant serves huge portions - two people could easily split one meal with appetizers. Their pie with home made ice cream is to die for."
89210,1326009,2012-05-22,1808816,Amy,"We had an absolutely fantastic experience at CA Dreaming! It was just as promised, beautifully appointed, fantastic view, situated on top of a hill in Pacific Grove. We loved Zeus their dog and Sarah was a wonderful host, gracious and accommodating. We will be back!

89210,1394161,2012-06-01,703197,Sam,"Staying with Evin and Sahra was really a great time. They were wonderful hosts and gracious Wu sharing their home with us. They were super kid-friendly. I could not have asked for a better air BnB experience. If you're planning a trip to the Monterey area, this is the hit!"
89210,1470488,2012-06-12,2539717,Darinee,"Amazing! We were so blown away by the beauty of the space... It was a wonderful retreat and a perfect location.

A must for those staying in Monterey:)


"
89210,1504677,2012-06-18,670477,Kristy,The perfect place to relax and enjoy the best of Monterey/Carmel. Sarah and Evan are gracious hosts who were at the ready with suggestions of  all the local establishments (we loved Holly's for breakfast). Tire yourself out exploring or just enjoy the sun in their beautiful outdoor space! 
89210,1521720,2012-06-20,1911524,Emily,"Wow, what an experience!!!  Sarah and Evan shared great info with the area.  We wished we stayed more days.  They make you feel at home and are not intrusive at all.  What a great collection of music.  I loved introducing my 4 and 6 yr old to records and THEY picked out the Beatles.  Very clean and great patio area to spend outside time.  Zeus is a great comfort and also made us feel at home.  What a sweet, quiet dog and my girls thought the world of him.  Thank you again and again.  Our Family really had an impressionable vacation moment at their Home.  We hope to come back!!!!

Emily, Bill and the Girls!!"
89210,1600468,2012-07-01,2091289,Doug,"This listing has everything Sarah and Evan say it does, and more! We would have given them six stars if it was possible. From the great recommendations Sarah gave us on what to do in town, to the comfortable and private guest suite, this place was a win! And we still miss their sweet dog, Zeus. Any time we're back in the area (and we definitely want to return to this relaxaing vacation spot) we would definitely stay here again. Thank you Sarah and Evan!"
89210,1633671,2012-07-05,1864736,Adam,"The suite (a semi-detached cottage, really) was spotless, private, and very charming, with a lot of (tasteful) character and an Asian-influenced decor--SO much nicer than staying in a hotel. Sarah and Evan went out of their way to be welcoming. A delightful experience all around."
89210,1649995,2012-07-07,2449132,Tim,Evan was a great host and made us really welcome. The location was very central to all the local sites and we would highly recommend him. Zeus the dog added a nice touch as he was totally friendly...
89210,1653645,2012-07-07,2825417,Tiffany,The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
89210,1694006,2012-07-12,2585715,John,"Evan and Sarah made us feel like we had arrived at home at our cute little place with amazing ocean view. The bed was extra comfortable, the bathroom with skylight was really nice, and the record collection so unique. "
89210,1697772,2012-07-13,2632935,Dianwei,"Everything is perfect. Sarah is a wonderful hostess. She gave me a thorough direction of staying and even some exclusive advices for my travel plan. And knowing I am not a native English speaker, Sarah spoke slowly and clearly when talking to me. I really appreciate her kindness. It's a pity that Evan was busy during my stay. I didn't have chance talking to him."
89210,1709948,2012-07-15,2301569,Brad,Great little bungalow & great hosts!  We would definitely recommend a stay here.
89210,1735255,2012-07-17,2853382,Amanda,"First of all the room is amazing.  Sarah and Evan have done a beautiful job of creating a really lovely space for their guests.  The bed is truly one of the most comfortable sleeping experiences ever, and you can see the ocean without raising your head from the pillow!  The bathroom is also big, full of light, and really well designed.  The skylight over the shower makes for a really magical experience.  The closet is also nice and big to hold all your luggage and give an ample dressing area.  The house is super close to everything.  The beach and downtown PG are just a few streets away and it only takes 10 minutes to get to the middle of Carmel.  The aquarium member passes are also great, you can get in half an hour before it opens to the general public with no waiting in line!  Sarah and Evan are also really wonderful people.  We got to talk to Sarah quite a lot and she was a very gracious and thoughtful lady.  She bent over backwards to be helpful and even helped up find a babysitter so we could go to a concert at the Bach Festival.  She even took our two year old on a walk with little doggy Zeus (who is also a sweetheart!)  If you stay, definitely take the dining and driving recommendations Sarah gives, they are super helpful.   I couldn't recommend Sarah and Evan's place highly enough.  I would stay there anytime I come to the Monterey area and will definitely be coming back.  The price is almost unbelievable considering the quality of the room itself and the friendly and helpful hosts!  "
89210,1755882,2012-07-20,2637791,Carolina,"Sarah was very welcoming, the cottage is totally gorgeous and her conversation and hints for food locally were excellent! Lovely stay even if short. We absolutely recommend their place."
89210,1767338,2012-07-22,476997,Alan,"What a fantastic place and such lovely people!  Evan and Sarah have a beautiful house in Pacific Grove which is ideally located between Carmel and Monterey and is nicer and quieter than both.
Our family stayed with Evan and Sarah in two of theirs rooms - the amazing bungalow which is adjacent to the main house and the Blue Room which is in the house.
The bungalow is fantastic - it has an amazing, huge bed and a wonderful shower. The bungalow opens onto a lovely garden area with views of the ocean. The Blue Room is very comfortable too. 
Sarah and Evan are delightful hosts, full of ideas about the neighbourhood including where to go and where to eat. Hula's was a great local Hawaian fusion restaurant and Holly's was a lovely place for breakfast and lunch. Save your money on the 17 Mile Drive in Carmel and go instead to Point Lobos State Park which is amazing.
Finally, Sarah and Evan encourage you to visit the Monterey Aquarium and we were really impressed especially the jellyfish displays.
You will not be disappointed if you stay with Sarah and Evan - they will help you have a great time in Pacific Grove.
"
89210,1790102,2012-07-24,176117,Richard Carson,"What a lovely place in a lovely town. Totally separate from main house, but it was so easy to pop into the kitchen in the main house and start the coffee maker. Sarah and Evan were super friendly and helpful. The guest quarters were uniquely and delightfuly decorated, and the selection of vinyl albums were great fun to pick through and play. Downtown awas a short drive with some terrific restaurants, Passion Fish comes to mind. Don't miss the Point Lobos sea lions and, of course, Cannery Row and Fisherman's Wharf in next door Monterey. Highly, highly recommend. Oh, and don't forget the tradition they have of wearing something red!"
89210,1795553,2012-07-25,2057266,Hannes,"Sarah and Evan are Wonderful hosts. The Little House facing the Garden lets you wake up with Ocean view, the record collection Is a uniquely charming detail. They gave us many helpful recommendations and made us Even visit the Aquarium for Free with their member Card. We regret Not having planned a longer Stay. Thanks again!"
89210,1810326,2012-07-27,1984064,Roger,"Sarah and Evan were the perfect hosts. They advised us on what to see, where to shop, where the nice walks were etc. They gave us two free tickets to the aquarium. Their home is lovely and the bungalow particularly beautiful. The children enjoyed the company of Zeus the dog. we would have no hesitation in recommending others to stay and if we ever go back to Monterey we will surely stay with them again."
89210,1818384,2012-07-28,2249558,Ashley,"Sarah and Evan were amazing hosts! My boyfriend and I stayed there for one night (unfortunately ONLY one - wanted to stay longer when we got there!) on our trip up the Cali coast. We arrived much later than anticipated but Sarah and Evan were kind enough to wait up for us and show us in. They were extremely friendly and great sources of information on the area. Not to mention their home itself was absolutely stunning - we stayed in the guest cottage which felt like a small spa get-a-way. It was extremely clean and well kept, the bathroom is pretty neat, and the bed was SO comfortable. We had full access to the main house for us of the kitchen which was great to store our food and make breakfast. Oh and of course - their dog Zeus was adorable and just the icing on the cake! I would HIGHLY recommend staying here to anyone."
89210,1825587,2012-07-29,963079,Stacy,Another great stay with Sarah and Evan.  Even though the weather was a bit cloudy we still sat outside in the evening and had a great time.  It's the only place we will stay when we come up to Monterey.
89210,1948041,2012-08-11,2586781,Philippe,"We spent one night in CA Dreaming yet could not enjoy the view (fog, not under Sarah & Evan's control): the Monterey Aquarium tickets proved very useful.

The house is ideally located, equally close to both Monterey & Carmel, and rooms are very comfortable.

Sarah & Evan are extremely nice and welcoming, and adapted the setup to our large 6 people family by setting up the Den accordingly. More, as we had forgotten to bring warm clothes for the whale watching trip we had planned the day following our stay, they kindly gathered and found warm stuff for each of us and thanks to them we did not freeze !!!

Finally, let's confirm that Zeus, their 3-legged-and-now-blind-dog is immensely cute!

Definitely a go for anybody visiting the area."
89210,1999657,2012-08-16,2229917,Catherine,We enjoyed our stay in the bungalow . Evan and Sarah are very friendly welcoming host.  Their dog Zeus is really cute and the fact that our dog could stay was one of the primary reasons we chose to stay here. It was a good match.  The Aquarium passes are a great extra bonus. Thanks again Sarah and Evan. 
89210,2051894,2012-08-21,1799768,Cathy,"Just know that Sarah & Evan are LOVELY people! Warm & friendly, VERY accommodating! We used the generous Aquarium passes and it was an added pleasure to a long and amazing weekend. So many 
pluses to our experience....
Do not forget to enjoy their ALBUMN collection..made me feel like I was 16 again..playing ""my stuff"" and secretly spinning my parents favs! So much to choose from..and unfortunately we did not discover the secret stash in the bottom drawer of the bureau until almost check-out time..more to enjoy next time... and even though the HUGE & VERY COMFY Bed is the centerpoint to the room, there was plenty of room to ""dance to the music""!!! 
BTW...WHERE do you get the coffee you make every morning??  It was DELICIOUS!!
Col & I are looking forward to our next visit and to renewing our friendship with you both & Zeus too...Baby says Woof Woof to her buddy!
All the best to you both!
Cat & Col
P.S. We have a couple of pics you may enjoy...let us know & we'll email them to you."
89210,2109374,2012-08-27,1812292,Linda,We loved the suite. It was like a spa retreat. Evan was very helpful and the aquarium passes were a great plus.
89210,2132097,2012-08-29,1929802,Nicolas And Geraldine,"Après un super accueil par evan et ""zeus"" nous avons découvert la chambre situe dans une petite annexe de la maison. La chambre était décoré avec goût avec une jolie vue sur le jardin et en toile de fond le pacifique. La salle de bains est grande et très propre et que dire de la douche... Ouah.... Quelle vue.... Un large choix musical nous a également permis de redécouvrir les plaisirs d'un 33 tours.
Pacific grove est un superbe endroit. Merci encore à evan pour nous avoir conseille la visite de Point Lobos, de l'aquarium, le Big Sur et sans oublier le restaurant Julia.
Nous avons également fait la connaissance de Sarah le jour de notre départ. 
Merci encore à tous les deux pour ce bon moment sous le,soleil californien

89210,2142103,2012-08-30,545090,Youen,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Monterey/Pacific Grove, Sarah, Evan & Zeus's  bedroom with ocean view is THE place to stay! Sarah and Evan were very nice and welcoming. They provided us a lot of great recommendation! we highly recommend their place. We will come back!"
89210,2158855,2012-09-01,1900794,Christiane,"Sarah and Evan were exceptional and easy going hosts to us, very friendly and extremely helpful with everything (very good advice for where to go and what to do..). We felt very much at home! We can only recommend their beautiful, wellkept and familiar place! We would definetly come and visit again if we can!  The location is also superb, centrally located for all the visits of the beautiful area.
Christiane and Dieter from Germany"
89210,2190675,2012-09-04,2580985,Valerie,"We enjoyed our stay at Sarah and Evan's bungalow very much! We enjoyed their beautiful garden, their warmth, their dog and the quiet atmosphere. The bungalow is tastefully designed and decorated. It has the most comfy bed and beautiful view of the ocean! Thank you Sarah and Evan for making our stay so pleasant and it was nice meeting you all!   Liping & Philip "
89210,2211927,2012-09-05,1426386,Anne,we were very pleased with the acceptance by sarah & evan of our last-minute request - they helped us out so much and it turned out to be a very pleasant stay. the bed is amazing and so is the bathroom! 
89210,2219299,2012-09-06,2681210,Karen,"It was a real treat to stay with Sarah and Evan! Not only was their home beautiful and relaxing, but they were both lovely to hosts. It was great to meet them and lovely to have an insight into their family and culture. They live in such a beautiful area.... Stay more nights, than less! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend. "
89210,2260253,2012-09-11,2638717,Sean,"Highly recommended! Sarah was staying in the main house next door and she was a lovely host! Gave us ideas on where to go and what to see and 2 tickets to the aquarium. The guesthouse was perfect; clean, comfy (king sized bed) and quiet. location was on a quiet street, few minutes drive to most of the sights."
89210,2278496,2012-09-14,3091007,Anna-Lena,"Peaceful home with the warm and welcoming hosts Sarah and Evan! The feng shui garden room offers a bed with large comfort and great view (if the weather is nice..., and not foggy ;)) and lets you stay relaxed and snug.  A good position for starting in the great nature of the coast!"
89210,2296798,2012-09-15,2611685,Mike & Marie,"The idea of staying in an unorthodox arrangement was new for us but Sarah and Evan's dream suite is just the right mood setter for starting any California get away.
The suite's space is  welled balance and appointed ( truly Zen-like) and the hosts are open, caring people. 
 "
89210,2351437,2012-09-20,52775,Hamilton,"Best place we've stayed on AirBnB.  My wife and I enjoyed our stay here!

The aquarium passes that they let us borrow were worth the price of the room alone.  On top of that, we got to stay in a very nice bungalow that Evan built himself.  The shower is to phenomenal.  Bed is super comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again."
89210,2405564,2012-09-25,1466528,Karen,"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed Sarah and Evan's fabulous bungalow, where we stayed during the Monterey Jazz Festival.  They were very gracious, and we particularly enjoyed Zeus, the three-legged wonder dog :)  And of course the gorgeous view and outdoor seating area, as well as the impressive/fun selection of vinyl records from which to choose and reminisce (to say nothing of singing along).  Hope to return soon!"
89210,2427595,2012-09-27,3058967,Lauren,"WOW! What a great first Airbnb experience! We think Sarah and Evan may have spoiled us for all our other stays. First the space is just lovely. So clean, bright and charming! They really put a lot of thought into designing their space, and their guests reap the benefits. Our favorite parts of the room were:  the luxurious bed, the amazing shower with skylight, and the entertainingly eclectic vinyl Lp collection. You can be as private or communal as you like in their space. The location is terrific. I would highly recommend staying here as a HQ for all your central coast adventures. Lastly, I would say that Sarah and Evan are really interesting and terrific hosts. They have tons of great advice for seeing the area, and are just plain fun to chat with. Looking back, we wish we booked much longer with them! Next time! Thanks so much to Sarah and Evan"
89210,2452451,2012-09-30,889543,Marcia,"After hosting many of our own airbnb guests this year, our stay with Evan & Sarah was our first time traveling as airbnb guests. 

Sarah & Evan are inspiring hosts who open their home and hearts to travelers.  In addition to  their warm personalities, other outstanding features that made our visit brilliant include: ZEUS their adorable dog, having a fenced area for our dogs, the ORGANIC mattress (which we offer our guests too, but not KING size -- that was some treat), the earth-friendly cleaning products, cork floor-no carpet- bungalow, their location (close to everything), their vinyl collection, their artwork and style, their ocean view from the bed, their back garden area, their ideals and values.   

Although we didn't read every one of their hundreds of positive reviews, the many ones we did read held true for us as well.  We would love to have Evan come here to build us a north-bay area bungalow.  It was a delicious experience (with fresh air from windows on 2 sides plus a great big sky window that opens) and like all the others, we highly recommend their CA Dreaming Bungalow.  Yes, the Aquarium tickets are a fabulous bonus feature too.  "
89210,2464190,2012-10-01,580247,Maria Teresa,"Staying at Sarah and Evan place is a whole experience! The room is nicely decorated with special things everywhere you look. Not to mention how confortable and warm is the place, and how they make you feel at home.
We where delighted by the record player with records from the 60's and 70's , that they were enfatic that we could enjoy as much (and loud) as we could! We left filled with their energy! We would love to stay there again, Thanks!"
89210,2502605,2012-10-04,3039364,Kevin,"we stayed 3 nights with sahra and evin, and really wish it could have been longer, such a great time we had. from the moment we arrived they made us feel so welcome, and steered us toward all the best bits of pacific grove and the surrounding area. california dreaming is one of the best places we have stayed in on our US trips, and believe me, we have stopped in some very very cool places over the years. from the delicious coffee in the mornings to a special culinary treat in the evening (rock cod yummy !), not to mention the great conversation and brilliant advice, i  challenge anyone to find anywhere better than this to stay. the room itself was serene, beautiful and very very comfortable, we really couldnt have wished for more. best of all was the vibe - warm, positive and fun. sahra and evin really are lovely people, and we will hopefully return very soon. thanks you so much you two, you were the highlight of our holiday. much love K+K xx."
89210,2587302,2012-10-12,3317847,Elizabeth,"We loved staying here - so glad we chose this over a hotel! The bungalow was great with so many details (water fountain, comfortable bed, skylight, great shower, record player) that we rushed back every night from sightseeing. We thought sharing the kitchen in the main house might be weird, but it wasn't an issue at all - Sarah and Evan made us feel so welcome and at home. They even loaned us a wine opener, picnic blanket and backpack for a few days of hiking. Plus, they had great 'insider' tips for seeing the area. We loved our stay, would definitely come back, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Thanks for the great stay!"
89210,2603304,2012-10-14,693422,Nancy,"Sarah and Evan are the perfect hosts!  They made us feel at home as soon as we arrived. The place is also perfect!  The location is very convenient to Pacific Grove, Monterey and to everything the area has to offer.  My husband and I agree that the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept on.  The design of the place is so beautiful and makes you feel at peace as soon as you walk in.  The little garden area is so delightful and has a view of the ocean. The Aquarium was great, and the restaurant recommendations that Sarah gave us were out-of-this world!  Especially Julia's!!!  A vegetarian restaurant that any carnivore would love!  We loved this place and would definitely recommend it and we hope to come back again and I can't imagine staying anywhere else."
89210,2630514,2012-10-16,2912079,Colm,"Staying with Sarah and Evan (and Zeus) was a real Californian Airbnb experience. They were very hospitable and welcoming into their home. Their suggestions for activities and food were all great - including Point Lobos and Julia's - and we very much enjoyed their conversation and company. The studio itself is unique with a fantastic view on a clear morning and we had a lot of fun with the record collection. Also, the bed is probably as comfy as you'll find anywhere so chop an hour or two off any plans you have for the day. If you use the aquarium tickets then it's pretty crazy value for money (the pair will save you $70). Highly recommended."
89210,2649887,2012-10-18,3554536,Oliver,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this wonderful zen-like bungalow and it has been the best airbnb experience so far! Sarah, Evan & Zeus (their pet dog) are wonderful hosts and extremely generous; they sent us home with some organic fruits and chilli tea which were delicious. They have a pair of member's pass to the amazing aquarium so it was free entry and we also got to skip the queue!

The room was super clean and overlooks the Pacific Ocean and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in.

It was a shame that it was such a short stay and I would definitely love to return and stay again with them for a longer period of time!"
89210,2669962,2012-10-21,3307342,David,"Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts full of recommendations for places to eat, as well as see. They strive to give their visitors a truly relaxing stay.  Letting us know what type of weather to expect before arrival helped us to pack just the right clothing.  Directions were clear and we were able to plan our road trip from San Francisco based on their alternately routes from the airport. Their idea of walking the coastal boardwalk to view the sunset and hear the bagpiper on Spanish Bay was a fantastic introduction to the area.  The bungalow was a lovely private retreat and the bed was indeed comfortable.  We enjoyed immensely the conversations we had with them individually to get to know them and learn more about the area.  Sitting out on the patio enjoying the ocean views was certainly the way to relax.  The aquarium passes were a wonderfully valuable bonus and we thoroughly enjoyed the 3 1/2 hours we spent browsing the exhibits in this fabulous attraction.  This is certainly a world class aquarium.  All in all it was a great way to end our California vacation."
89210,2715072,2012-10-25,185359,Meryl,"CA dreamin'  is perfect! It is a peaceful retreat, a beautiful ocean view and all the entertainment you could ask for in the vinyl room! Probably the best sleep I've had in years - partly the serenity of the setting, but also the hosts. If you want your setting to include a lovely room and easy access to Monterey, stay here. If you value gracious hosts, who are warm, caring and knowledgeable locals, absolutely stay here. Sarah and Evan are the ultimate AirBnB hosts: they are genuine folks who will take excellent care of you. We will be back for more!"
89210,2727767,2012-10-27,385586,Emily,"We had a great stay at the house. Sarah was extremely friendly and a great host. (Evin was away most of our stay there) She gave us good, helpful recommendations for food and hikes and CA in general, and our bungalow was so comfortable!!! The bed was amazing and we loved the sky window in the bathroom. Also, we made good use of the record player and eclectic music, as well as the kitchen. Thanks again! "
89210,2837963,2012-11-08,3354508,Judy,"I cannot imagine a better place to stay, period. Sarah and Evan were warmly welcoming, feeling like old friends from the start. The bungalow is perfect: clean as could be, beautifully and tastefully decorated, a comfy king bed, a luxurious open shower bath, an ocean view, a lovely garden with sitting area, peaceful and quiet, with the option of being social with others, or not. All this perfectly located to explore the Monterey peninsula, and S&E offered many great suggestions about that too, tailored to our needs. And, with the aquarium tix the price was quite a deal too. Highly recommended and if we are back int he area, we will return.
"
89210,2872675,2012-11-12,4085405,Shell,"With the hubby traveling, I decided last minute to take kids to Monterey over the weekend.  No one could care for out dog so I looked to rent a place since dog friendly hotels rarely let you leave dog in room. What a fabulous surprise!  The room was perfect! Beautiful, clean and super comfy beds!  
Both of my kids looked at me funny when I told them we were  staying at ""some strange people's house?"" Evan and Sarah are gracious and super helpful hosts.  Sent us to delicious local restarants and great beaches and were so kind to the kids and our dog.   We will definitely be staying there again!"
89210,2886753,2012-11-15,813443,Steven,Amazing place to stay in Pacific Grove and the perfect home base to explore the area! Sarah and Evan gave us the best recommendations for local eats and sights and were very welcoming and great hosts. Thank you!
89210,2903946,2012-11-17,4098759,Qaasim,"We highly recommend Sarah and Evan as hosts! 

They are incredibly kind and thoughtful people. From the moment we made our reservation, we appreciated how clearly they communicated, including giving detailed directions to their place. We even heeded their restaurant recommendation, and enjoyed a memorable meal and views at restaurant on the way to their place.

We stayed in the bungalow, which was just as beautiful in person, as it appears in the pictures. It is a peaceful and inviting space. We also enjoyed the beautiful view to the sea and full access to the kitchen in the main house.

We stayed in, the evening of our stay, and enjoyed great conversation with our hosts before bed, as well as over freshly brewed coffee in the morning. We also took advantage of the aquarium tickets. It is truly an incredible place.

We would happily stay with them again and encourage you to do so!"
89210,2912542,2012-11-19,270515,Ann,"It was such a pleasure to stay at Sarah and Evan's. They're charming, really knowledgable about the area, and super-welcoming. The cottage is so lovely, especially the bed and the bathroom, that we were really happy and relaxed being there. They put out coffee in the morning, gave us absolute privacy, and gave us the best restaurant recommendations, too. Their free passes to the aquarium are just the icing on the cake--it saved us the entrance fee and standing in line to get in. The turntable in the cottage was an unexpected surprise--we really enjoyed listening to their record collection. We loved all of it! Thanks, Sarah and Evan!"
89210,2940043,2012-11-22,3312320,Louise,"We all had a wonderful time staying at CA Dreaming Bungalow - clean, cozy with fabulous decor.  Evan was a fantastic host, and Zeus was very welcoming too!  The perfect place for a relaxing break away. The free passes to the aquarium came in very handy also.  I would heartily recommend staying here, you will love it!"
89210,2989990,2012-11-28,4230131,Bruno,Sarah and Evan were absolutely great hosts. Their place  is overflowing with charm and good vibrations. The bed was amazing but the highlight was definitely the shower. They are both very graceful hosts and made me feel at home right the way. My only regret is that I only spent one night with them. Had I spent a few more nights I would have got to know them beyond the initial pleasantries. They seem like a very down to earth and interesting couple.
89210,2996999,2012-11-30,1015393,USA Journey,"It is all about GREAT! 
Great hosts Sarah and Evan compose a good team! Very warm, he did the design of the room and she did the decoration! 
Great location! Very well situated close to everything!
Great ocean view from the bed! Loved it!
Great bed, great open sky shower, great vinyls to listen,...
Great quality/price! 
Great dog with a name of great god! (Zeus) 
A must to visit the Monterey peninsula!  
We will stay there again! It was very inspiring!"
89210,3033309,2012-12-05,4250193,Emily,"Sarah & Evan were wonderful hosts and their cottage, garden and house are beautiful and comfortable. I was visiting friends in Monterey with my mom and sister. We stayed in the cottage which had plenty of room for all of us to sleep comfortably and we cooked dinner and breakfast in the main house. I would definitely recommend them as hosts."
89210,3041265,2012-12-08,2199172,Richard,"Sarah and Evan were warm, wonderful hosts. The cottage is comfortable and relaxing, beautifully appointed and easy. Hip record collection too. "
89210,3082751,2012-12-13,4204915,Paul,"We had a wonderful time at Sarah and Evan’s home. They were warm, helpful, and super-friendly. Sarah helped us find just the right restaurant one evening and gave us lots of information about how to enjoy Point Lobos. If you like to cook, they welcome cooking at their house and are very welcoming of folks with kids. Their home is beautiful, warm and inspiring. We hope to return again soon!"
89210,3089635,2012-12-14,321448,Ross,"Sarah and Evan put together a great experience. Sarah is happy to give as many suggestions as you want, and having followed all of them, I can say they were all good!

The sliding glass doors overlooking the ocean make the room feel big and like it's part of the outdoors. The bed is huge and crazy comfortable. The record player is a great touch that makes you want to ditch your laptop and cell phone for a bit to listen to some Monkees and Johnny Cash.

5 stars, 2 thumbs up, all that good stuff. This is a perfect getaway for a couple or anyone looking to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium."
89210,3098960,2012-12-16,4351625,Tuck,"Sarah and Evan were great hosts.  We really enjoyed our stay.  They were very hospitable and helpful, and their place is conveniently located between Carmel and Monterey.  We highly recommend staying with them. "
89210,3119020,2012-12-19,1375009,Ben And Liz,"Sarah and Evan were fantastic hosts. Very friendly and gave us some great ideas things to do (Point Lobos hike is a must). Great location, as peaceful and relaxing as it sounds. The aquarium tickets were a really nice touch too, definitely worth a visit! "
89210,3136901,2012-12-22,4397090,Debbie,"This charming place is located in a great area, has beautiful views, and the hosts are some of the nicest people I have ever met.  The room is spotless, super comfy bed, and lovely bathroom.  This is a winner and I will be back!"
89210,3155108,2012-12-25,2686791,Beth,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow is wonderful! The view is spectacular, the bed is so comfy, the record collection was fun to play. Sarah couldn't have been nicer--she made sure that we had everything we needed so we would have a very special time--from directions, to restaurant suggestions (go to Julia's if you like vegetarian cooking), to tickets to the Monterey Aquarium. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town. Thanks Sarah!"
89210,3166004,2012-12-27,263681,Chrissie,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Sarah and Evan's bungalow over Christmas and it was absolutely wonderful! The bungalow is wonderfully decorated, and is super quiet with lots of privacy. And what a great ocean view! The bed is huge and warm and super comfy, and we loved the fantastic collection of vinyl albums (we listened to a bunch!). Our whole stay was incredibly peaceful and relaxing. The Aquarium was also amazing, especially the jellyfish and the leafy sea dragons. :)

I didn't have a chance to meet Sarah and Evan in person because they were away, but I talked with them via email and phone beforehand and they are just the nicest people you can possibly imagine. Really terrific hosts! They made sure all the details were taken care of and that we had everything we needed. They even sent us a huge list of recommended places to eat and sights to see in the area. I hope we can stay with them again next time we are in Monterey!"
89210,3219753,2013-01-02,4051917,Henning & Jacqui,"We spent four nights at  ""CA Dreaming"" suite and fell in love with it. It is so comfortable and nothing beats waking up with the view of the Monterey Bay through the large sliding door which leads onto the private patio. The modern bathroom with skylight window over the shower is fantastic. WIFI is available but during our stay the bandwidth was not enough to allow streaming Netflix or Pandora.
Sarah and Evan are great hosts who give you privacy but are there for you whenever you need them. That includes great tips for dinner and of course tickets to the Aquarium. "
89210,3314875,2013-01-09,1816282,Gina,"My husband and I stayed at Sarah and Evans California Dreaming bungalow due to relocating to Monterey from Hawaii, and it was such a beautiful soft place to land after long travels with many bags and our 4 month old baby!  They were both super accomodating, provided everything we needed and then some.  High quality linens, WiFi, coffee, teas, and eco friendly cleansing products provided.  We hung out at the house, did computer work, prepped for our move, felt right at home, and met some super cool people to connect with. Would def recommend to any traveler!  "
89210,3331251,2013-01-12,4105605,Sam,"My husband, 20 month old toddler and I stayed with Sarah and Evan for three nights. The bungalow was perfect! Huge comfy bed, lovely shower with skylight above for the outdoors feel and of course the sea view! The use of the main house was great for us for when the little one went to sleep and Sarah and Evan always made us feel comfortable and welcome when we needed to hang out or use the kitchen. The location is great for trips into Monterey (for the Aquarium - of course), to Asilomar beach for awesome running trails and for road trips down to Big Sur. Sarah and Evan also gave us loads of tips and instructions for our days out which helped us get the best out of trip. Finally, a mention to Zeus, the fantastically patient and toddler friendly guard dog!
All in all a great stay in a lovely clean and comfortable bungalow with super helpful and friendly people!"
89210,3340114,2013-01-13,4140157,Annette,"Great location, great space, great people!

The location was perfect for our trip in that it was easy to find, only a few minutes drive to the Aquarium, and a couple of minutes from Trader Joe's.  (By the way, the FREE passes to the Aquarium was a really nice moneysaver!) We loved the ocean view and how generally quiet and peaceful the area was.  

The California Dreaming bungalow itself is lovely.  The bed is dangerously comfy- you might want to stay there for your whole vacation!  :-)  Everything was clean and worked well, though the night we were there, wifi was fine for reading the news but not strong enough to stream anything.  Being able to play old fashioned vinyl records was a rare treat and more than made up for the lack of internet radio.  

Sarah and Zeus were both delightful and we felt well taken care of."
89210,3351188,2013-01-15,2755212,Kal,"All we can say is ""Wow!!"" What a special couple and wonderfully personal accomodation. Our experience was intimate, spiritual and blessed. We were near everything gr8 in Montery. Sarah was right-on with her dining ecommendations. The bungalow has everything you can want, including a very eclectic selection of albums ... yes, albums, and of course a working record player that will put you back in ""high"" school. There are lots of arty things all around. Some seem to be intentionally ""hidden,"" but keep looking and you'll be rewarded.
Hat's off to what Sara and Evan have done here, and to how you'll feel when you meet them and relax in their wonderful, peaceful bungalow away from home. Have fun, and remember to pet Zeus."
89210,3391545,2013-01-22,341199,Paula,Nice comfy place. Great view of the ocean and the location is central to both Monterey and Carmel. Very helpful hosts in providing information on what the area offers.
89210,3407762,2013-01-24,4318913,Simona,"We had a lovely visit at Sarah and Evan's place. The guest house was very clean and comfortable, a beautiful space. An ocean view from bed, excellent record collection and the most fantastic bathroom. The weather was nice enough (late January) that Sarah insisted we open the skylight while showering - we did and it was great! Sarah had great recommendations for our (very short) stay. We visited Asilomar Beach and the Aquarium, drove around the area and took it all in.

Although we only got a few minutes talking with Evan, the pair of them are gracious hosts, along with Zeus the adorable three legged dog. 

Thank you Sarah and Evan.

89210,3419670,2013-01-27,1423524,Melanie,"All good.  No complaints at all.  It was comfortable and clean with beautiful views of the ocean, and the hosts are gracious and social.  Great value and great place!"
89210,3448391,2013-01-31,4718523,Marilyn,"Amazing private space with breathtaking ocean views.  We enjoyed the comfort and quiet our hosts afforded us, as well as great location for venturing around Monterey peninsula. 
It was fun to hear some of Sarah's own musical compositions and to learn about Evan 's entrepreneurial ventures.  Monterey Aquarium passes  gave us view of spectacular Seahorse and Sea-dragon exhibit. Gracious hosts and good times.

89210,3463374,2013-02-03,984920,Sharon (And JP),"The California Dreaming Artists Cottage (completely private) w/ a magnificant Pacific Ocean view from the huge sliding door of the bedroom was as it is described in the write up and even more.  Photos cannot really portray the beauty of this place.  Evan and Sahra were wonderful un-imposing hosts.  They were kind, left us to our privacy but were always around to answer questions, etc.  Sahra (Sarah) even did a load of laundry for us (as she insisted we did not need to give up a hour in a local laundromat and miss out on touring around).  What makes this room great besides the view is the BATHROOM.. it is large with a huge open walk in shower.  The room and the garden it faces is very Zen.  Watching the sky light up in the morning with the peace and serenity of the place makes for the start of a very good day.  Must recommend Julia's Restaurant (was one of the best places we ate in our 9-day trip to Cali)."
89210,3495764,2013-02-07,4968846,George,"Awesome place to stay, great view, safe neighborhood. The room was comfortable and relaxing. The hosts are friendly and helpful. Our dog got along with their dog. Had a great time."

We were welcomed by friends of Sarah and Evan who were staying in the house, they were very nice and friendly. The passes to the aquarium were very useful. We will definitely come back! Thank you very much!"
89210,3517484,2013-02-11,3676509,Anne-Laure,"With my mom visiting from France and being a huge fan of golf, I decided to book us a small week end in the Carmel area during the AT&T Pebble Beach tournament.
Sarah and Evan are truly wonderful hosts and made everything possible for us to feel welcome and comfortable even though they were out of town. 
The bungalow is just a heaven to spend some relaxing time - the bed is truly wonderful, I wish we could have had a few more nights there and nothing to do to just relax and get some rest !
If you're looking for a place where time just stops to get a break from your day to day craziness, that's definitely your spot. Just put down your luggage and ... relax.

Thank you again for this great time, I will definitely stay there for my next trip in the area !

89210,3567160,2013-02-18,4567110,Jamie,"Sarah and Evan are great hosts.  Their space is beautiful and very calming, and the outdoor garden area (with ocean view) is a wonderful oasis.

We had a wonderful visit!"

One fun surprise was getting to explore their great record collection. We would definitely recommend a stay at Sarah and Evan's place! "
89210,3603885,2013-02-22,1649224,Martha,"Sarah and Evan are very easy going and down to earth hosts.  As described,  we were greeted by Zeus,  the ""fierce"" watch dog.  The apartment is separated from the rest of the house by a beautiful, succulent filled garden.    My husband and I were temped to stay in bed the entire trip because of the amazing bed.  The large,  open shower with skylight is an experience unto itself. (and is stocked with great organic products!)   My husband and I had fun picking out records to listen to in the morning while we enjoyed our coffee and ocean view.
It was in a fantastic centrally located spot,  which allowed us to travel down to Big Sur,  and up to Santa Cruz for day trips.   The restaurants in town were greater than expected. (Passionfish was our favorite)
We are so lucky to have chosen CA Dreaming for our first ever AirBnB experience!"
89210,3662341,2013-03-01,5022944,Sudabeh,"Sarah is a delightful person. We enjoyed meeting her.

They offed spot on sight seeing and eating recommendations.  Additionally, the guest house was better than the pics suggest.  It is quiet, clean, and has a killer view of the ocean.  The location is very convenient, about 5 to 10 minutes away from the touristy activities in Monterey.  Overall if we find ourselves back in the area, we know where we will be staying! Thank you for the great experience!"
89210,3789810,2013-03-15,4095203,Mary,"CA Dreaming was a fabulous experience, from Zeuss the wonder dog who bonded with us and visited daily to the fantastic vinyl collection in the kitchenette.  The bungalow was very clean, the bed super comfortable, the property serene. If that wasn't enough, Sarah and Evan were the perfect hosts. They were friendly, kind and extremely helpful. I hope to return again, and I know Ches would love to see Zeuss again!"
89210,3800790,2013-03-16,5333783,Matthew,We had a really quick stay however the hosts were very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the area and restaurants.  The two aquarium tickets were a great bonus!  Sarah had maps of the aquarium and the Monterey area and walked us through them to be sure we didn't miss anything with the limited time that we had.

The room is lovely, thoughtfully decorated, very comfortable, and the record collection is fun. Right outside is a terrace with deck chairs, picnic table and a beautiful view. We would love to return some day."
89210,3884264,2013-03-24,3676320,Paul Allan,"Sarah was a fantastic host: warm, welcoming, and very helpful. This was our first Airbnb experience and she made it perfect.

89210,4061301,2013-04-07,4793627,Drew,"My wife and I stayed in Sarah and Evan's ""CA Dreaming"" guest house/suite for the last couple nights of our honeymoon and it was absolutely perfect! The bed was incredibly comfortable, the shower was the coolest shower ever, the record player and record collection were a fun classy touch, and the ocean view garden was beautiful. Sarah and Evan were perfectly charming and hospitable, giving us all the local tips we were looking for while at the same time giving us all the privacy you would expect at a nice bed-and-breakfast. They make the stay very easy. Lastly, their dog Zeus -- a friendly, blind, three-legged little rescue dog -- is ridiculously adorable. To sum it up, this is the perfect place to stay for a convenient and comfortable spot in the Monterey/Carmel/Pacific Grove area."
89210,4107630,2013-04-10,5192979,Kyle,"My wife and I visit the Bay Area and Monterrey Bay fairly regularly and this place has been by far the best place we've stayed. We stayed in the California Dreaming bungalow. Clean, Cozy, a modern bath and shower and with a fantastic view of the ocean, this place is perched on the top one of the highest hills of Pacific Grove. Definitely recommended."
89210,4212682,2013-04-19,5269038,S'Zanne,"What a haven!  If you think you can't afford that expensive trip to a four star hotel, look no further! You'll feel pampered from the heavenly bed to the Zen shower experience, to the mesmerizing views from the majestic garden-courtyard to the big blue yonder. Sarah and Evan are warm and welcoming hosts who make you feel right at home. In fact, you may not want to leave! Their record collection rocks and I have to compliment them on their coffee machine...sometimes it's the simple pleasures that really make a trip. They generously shared their lovely, peaceful home and their time, giving tips on local eateries and coastal excursions. So, if your soul needs a deep drink, Sarah's and Evan's wonderful bungalow will have you California dreaming...until the next time! It's a real find!"
89210,4279741,2013-04-24,4581720,Garry,"We had a fantastic time in Pacific Grove! Our stay at Sarah and Evan's lovely home was delightful. I loved her gardens and view of the ocean in the distance. Sarah was full of recommendations on places to eat, parks to visit, shops to see, etc. and they were so helpful. We were on the go sightseeing so, we didn't have too much time to get to know the Bakers unfortunately. They are a lovely couple who made us feel comfortable and welcome. We hope we can return someday."

Thanks for the wonderfully relaxing stay!"

Sorting through and playing some of their records was great fun.  Sarah and Evan were very hospitable and provided us a number of terrific recommendations for local attractions and restaurants.  We will be forever thankful for the pointers that Sarah provided regarding visiting Point Lobos.  Our time at that park ended up being the top highlight of our entire two week trip to California.  We highly recommend the CA Dreaming room to anyone visiting the Monterey Bay area!"

The beds were super comfy and we enjoyed their lovely garden. The location is very convenient, with grocery stores just a few blocks away and Cannery Row down the road from their neighborhood.

We had a chance to talk to Sarah and she was super friendly and welcoming. We also hung out with Zeus, who was a really chill dog.

Definitely a fantastic place to stay!

There is an exceptional record collection; yes, records, which we so enjoyed, staying up later than initially intended as we were having such fun taking a multi-decade trip down memory lane.

We so much enjoyed the hospitality and friendliness of Sarah and Evan. We took the opportunity for the free access to the Monterey Aquarium with its fantastic wildlife to observe.  Sarah provided us with great  recommendations for Dinner at Hula's and Massaro + Santos. The garden appartment had a great ocean view and came with a fantastic bathroom. We were listening to the old venyl collection at night and really had good fun. 
This was a true airbnb experience and the reason we so much love this way of travelling the world."

We had a great time at Monterey because of our stay at their cozy bungalow. The house is very close to the main streets, so you have quick access to Cannery Row and downtown. The bungalow itself is one of the most relaxing places I've stayed at ever. The place is small but it has all the essential items you'll need. They even have a record player! We listened to vinyls all weekend! Lastly the bed... It's so comfy! You can literally just plop on the bed and you'll sink in softly. We were thinking the nights would have been cold considering the weather, but we were so warm in the room. The aquarium tickets were a nice addition as well :) Overall we loved our stay at Sarah and Evans, and we would recommend them to all our friends!"

Sarah spent time with us to show us everything and to tell us about the area, places to go, etc.  She was so nice, hospitable, and genuinely interested in us and our successful experience of the place and area.

Included in the price were two passes to the Monterey Aquarium, which was really delightful.  

The value of this room was a great deal more than the price we paid.

Forgot to mention the patio and view of the water.  Also very beautiful.

Also forgot to talk about Zeus, their charming little dog.  He's a great addition to the whole experience. 

We can unreservedly recommend that you stay with Sarah and Evan."

The garden space with beautiful as well.  I enjoyed sitting in bed while watching the hummingbirds fly by the picturesque backdrop of the garden space and ocean view. We also had a blast playing the records Sarah and Evan provided in the space. Both Sarah and Evan are lovely people!  They are extremely kind and hospitable.  I very much enjoyed Sarah's ""green drinks"" that she shared with me in the mornings as well as our conversations.  Definitely quality people with a very welcoming, and cozy space.  We would highly recommend staying with Sarah and Evan.  We also loved the aquarium passes they provided to us during our stay.  All in all a fantastic find on airbnb!!!  "

Scenically located with great view out onto Pacific Ocean, it was about five minutes driving time from Monterey's Cannery Row, and another 10 minutes from Carmel-by-the-Sea.  Sarah and Evan clearly made an investment to ensure the bungalow offers visitors a high-quality stay.  The cleanliness was hotel caliber; wireless Internet access was provided as well. The record player - complete with a diverse collection - was an awesome touch. Sarah was extremely accessible in terms of recommending local restaurants and activities; she and Evan are clearly season Airbnb vets.   Great stay.  "

It was like a spiritual retreat with lovely gardens everywhere and an environment which encourages relaxation.  They themselves are the warmest and friendliest people you've ever met - not exaggerating - they were THAT nice.  The amount of attentive care that went into trying to anticipate our every need was truly impressive.  We had children in our party and they brought out boxes of legos and games for them.  We rented out both the main house (Peaceful Artist Home) and the bungalow (CA Dreaming) and there was more than enough room for our family of 10.  They were ready with detailed and clear instructions on the house and recommendations on good, local eateries.  We wholeheartedly recommend!!!"

Sarah and Evan were very, very warm and friendly and gave us great tips on exploring the area and were overall great hosts. The bungalow comfortably slept 3 people. You'll need a car to access Monterey town; the one time we called a cab it arrived in less than 10 minutes. Overall, a great find in Monterey!"
89210,6483606,2013-08-14,5697028,Brenda,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Sarah. What a nice bonus to have 2 Monterey aquarium tickets included with the stay (and advice on where to park for free). The bed was super comfy & the record player has inspired us to seek one out once returning home. Loved the proximity to everything...enjoyed Sarah's hospitality. Highly recommended.

89210,6579733,2013-08-18,4474334,Laurent,"We had a very good stay in Sarah and Evan’s place. We felt sorry we were not able to meet them in persons, as Sarah and Evan had been more than helpful before and during our stay in their place, taking a lot of time to answer our questions. The rooms are clean and the bungalow is a very nice flat to stay in with a pleasant garden. The all place is very « human » with many personal details which makes you feel « at home ».   Last but not least, the two free passes to the Aquarium are a real bonus considering the prices of the admission. We strongly recommend staying with Sarah and Evan. August 2013. "
89210,6651619,2013-08-20,3929087,Lucy,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow had the most amazing bed! You should stay here just to experience the comfort. It also had many other great features including the shower and is a real tranquil oasis, complete with a relaxing water feature in the bedroom. Not only is it peaceful and comfortable, it's a great base for exploring both Monterey and Carmel, the free passes to the aquarium were a real bonus. We only met Sarah and Evan briefly but they were incredibly helpful and friendly. We would recommend this place for anyone visiting this area."
89210,6751202,2013-08-24,6162515,Marie,"Petit bungalow adorable et confortable, Sarah et Evan nous ont accueillis dans leur havre de paix avec une gentillesse rare, nous n'y sommes restés que 3 jours mais nous aurions adoré prolonger ce séjour à Monterey tellement il fut agréable!
Vivement conseillé."

89210,6870036,2013-08-28,5886907,Sara,My husband and I stayed at Sarah & Evan's studio for two nights while on our honeymoon.  They were very welcoming hosts (along with their dog Zeus) and had lots of great recommendations for food (grocery stores and restaurants) and area attractions (don't miss the Point Lobos State Reserve!).  The studio was lovely -- tastefully and thoughtfully designed -- and the view of the ocean impressive.  We'd love to stay with Sarah & Evan again if we're back in the area.
89210,7116155,2013-09-07,6783696,J.P.,"Accueil très chaleureux. Plein de bons conseils pour faire de notre séjour un moment spécial. On a ainsi découvert des restaurants où vont les gens du coin et les meilleures balades de la région. En ce qui concerne la chambre individuelle, tout était parfait. deux touches donnent au studio un charme particulier: le velux au-dessus de la douche, pour voir le ciel en se douchant, et la vue sur l'océan directement depuis le lit! Fantastique!
Le jardin zen avec vue sur le Pacifique constitue aussi un highlight. Et si vous pensez entendre l'autoroute, écoutez encore, c'est l'océan."
89210,7137626,2013-09-08,1651935,Shelby,"My boyfriend and I only stayed at this rental one night, but it was one of our favorites spots on our West Coast trip.  

Sarah and Evan were beyond welcoming and friendly, sharing their aquarium passes, local food spots, and insight into what to check out while in the Monterey area.  

Not to mention the property and rental are incredibly beautiful and  cozy.  The record player was also an extra bonus to this spot :)

If you find yourself in Monterey, stay here!!"
89210,7191113,2013-09-10,5077415,Christoph,"Staying with Sarah and Evan was just great. The two took great care of us and are both very kind. They were always around if we had any questions. The place is simply wonderful, no more words needed! I highly recommend anybody who goes down or up on Hwy No 1 or just wants to stay at Monterey to stay with Sarah and Evan!"
89210,7227866,2013-09-11,1620287,Laura,"The loveliest people you could meet. We had a amazing time, playing music and chatting. The room was amazing and clean - and the shower is amazing you can hear the birds. Would come back and stay just to see them both."
89210,7249744,2013-09-13,3404365,Joan,Sara and Evan are wonderful hosts. They are generous and caring and their beautiful home is a delight to stay in. the location is so convenient to everything you would want to see or do . I would recommend them to all guests. 
89210,7297826,2013-09-14,8001715,Magdalena,"Sarah and Evan have been the perfect hosts, and so was there home and room we lived in! Communication was so easy, althouh we asked for a room so last-minute, they somehow arranged it for us to be able to stay! We had such a nice bedroom, perfectly clean and lovely decorated! The whole home of Sarah & Evan was so peaceful, calm and quiet in a great neigborhoud having everything around you within some minutes! Sarah & Evan where the most lovely and nice and helpful people I have ever met in the way they made us feel so welcomed and comfortable! They would have done and offered anything to make you feel good and comfy!

We thank you so much, and wished we could have stayed longer!
Go there if you can!"
89210,7312073,2013-09-15,5706645,Bethany,"What a fantastic place to stay, with a warm family feel and amazing views. Sarah and Evan are lovely hosts, and could not have been more generous and helpful. We hope to return one day for a longer stay!"
89210,7361984,2013-09-17,6949018,John,"Sarah and Evan are great hosts with a lovely home. They are very helpful in suggesting hikes, restaurants, etc in the area. The California Dreaming suite is very comfortable with the best bed ever - we hated to leave! We hope to stay there again some day! "
89210,7430421,2013-09-20,2312443,Tricia,"What a wonderful, relaxing place to stay.  Sarah and Evan were great hosts - really friendly and always available to answer our questions and provide advice on local places to visit, but never intruding on our privacy.  Our room was so comfortable, and we loved searching through all the vinyl albums to see what we could play next.  It was great to wander out into the garden in the morning and see the ocean far below us and watch humming birds visiting the flowers - we'd never seen humming birds before!  There's so much to see nearby, and getting free passes to the aquarium was a real bonus - that place is amazing - I never knew jellyfish were so beautiful.  One place Sarah and Evan advised us to visit was Point Lobos State Reserve, and that really is a place you shouldn't miss - I think it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen, with an even more amazing view round every corner and so much wildlife, including sea otters in several of the coves.  All in all, we had a wonderful couple of days, and coming back at the end of each day to such a peaceful place just made it even better.  Go there if you can!"
89210,7597274,2013-09-26,6521534,Bjørn,As our stay comprise two different bookings this review is identical to our previous one – a great place with wonderful hosts.
89210,7639904,2013-09-28,6521534,Bjørn,"What a great stay! Sarah and Evan had that rare attitude of being extremely helpful and understanding the need of privacy. The bungalow was impeccable, even if there are no real kitchen facilities; we had full access to the kitchen in their house. We loved the Asian flavor of the interior, the view and the fantastic bed; we even got free aquarium tickets. If you do have the opportunity to stay with Sarah and Evan; do not hesitate!   "
89210,7689803,2013-09-30,6523616,Eric,"Sarah and Evan were great hosts and welcomed us upon arrival. Their dog Zeus is really cool, he's quite aware of his surroundings for being blind. The location in Pacific Grove was great for quick trips to Carmel, Carmel Valley and Monterey. Definitely took advantage of the 2 aquarium tickets, adult tickets are $35 each these days, bonus! "
89210,7761170,2013-10-01,3559024,Trevor,Very comfortable accommodations and their location is super convenient to downtown Monterey and Carmel locations.  The complimentary aquarium passes definitely save a significant chunk of change as well.  Would definitely stay here again when we're back in the area.
89210,7806244,2013-10-04,6166875,Justine,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay, met Sarah and Evan briefly on our final morning and they gave us a great recommendation for breakfast. Very quiet, comfortable bed, lovely secluded garden with hummingbirds and we also got to meet the adorable Zeus
Great vinyl collection and the aquarium tickets are a real money saver. 
Really liked the shower area where you could look up to the sky, and we were blessed with fantastic weather. If you get the chance take the 17 mile drive, the views are stunning and we loved the area so much that a return visit is a definite."
89210,7976926,2013-10-11,5583230,Michel,Chez Sarah & Evan vous avez l'impression de faire partie de la famille et d'être reçu comme tel ! Le bungalow indépendant permet une totale liberté horaire. Le lit est géant ! Vous disposez de quoi faire votre petit déjeuner. En se levant le matin vous avez vue directe sur la baie de Monterey.
89210,8160329,2013-10-18,6976985,John,"Gosh, how to explain just how great this place is? The bungalow was totally adorable, completely unpretentious yet very comfortable, and the ocean views were stunning. Evan was an incredible host and awesome guy to boot. Loved our backyard conversations, very much appreciated the help and food and hiking recommendations, and all around found the experience right on the mark. We stayed an extra day we liked it so much. Many thanks, Evan! I'm sure we'll be back. Can't recommend this place enough."
89210,8248586,2013-10-22,6533163,Thorsten,"We had an amazing stay at Sarah's and Evan's home. They are amazing hosts and went above and beyond expectations. Before we arrived Evan contacted us with room details and clear directions and a restaurant recommendation for a place with the most stunning views. 

Once we reached their home we found a short manual with instructions how to get around. Sarah and Evan also provide passes for the Monterrey Aquarium which is definitely worth a visit. Beyond Sarah's and Evan's amazing hospitality, the suite itself is very comfortable and has all you need (coffee, filtered water and a fridge!). Anytime we're back in the area we'll definitely be booking a stay at their home again."
89210,8280931,2013-10-23,756137,Lauren,"Totally relaxing experience from start to finish. Sarah & Evan went above and beyond to accommodate us on our one-night stay between other bookings, even ensuring that their aquarium passes would be available for us to use before the next guests checked in. The bungalow itself has everything you need for a short stay, including a bar fridge, microwave, kettle, hairdryer, etc. Reliable wifi, really comfy bed, great ocean view and perfectly located for visiting Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel. Evan was a great host, always helpful and happy to have a chat, but the self-contained studio also affords you as much privacy as you like. Would definitely stay here again if in the area. Thanks so much, Sarah, Evan and Zeus!"
89210,8308877,2013-10-25,7892088,Vicki,"A lovely space, self contained with private access from the main house, giving us total privacy and allowing us to come and go as we pleased.

Sarah was extremely helpful in advance and Evan just as welcoming and helpful during our stay - the space was beautifully decorated, extremely clean and spacious and a perfect base for our 2 nights in Monterey.

The recommendations were great and allowed us to try some fantastic non tourist restaurants during our stay.  And of course the aquarium passes were an extra nice touch!"
89210,8334712,2013-10-26,1607947,Tom,Fantastic studio right in the heart of Pacific Grove. Evan gave us a fabulous restaurant recommendation and was welcoming and friendly. Zeus is great!
89210,8539106,2013-11-04,1006295,Kyle,"We had a wonderful time in our first stay in Pacific Grove.  Certainly, the location to Monterey and Carmel (and more) couldn't be much better.  The only gripe I'd have is that it's not a good walking (Website hidden by Airbnb) sidewalks, and the locals drive like they aren't on vacation.  

The atmosphere at this location, though, was exactly what we were looking for...relaxed and easygoing.  Zeus made us smile whenever he wandered by, even when randomly visiting us in our room and waking us up from naps.  

Evan was full of great suggestions on where to go around the area, and we had some fun exploring some of his recommendations.

And the passes to the aquarium were well utilized.  We got to visit our Otter friends, and chat it up with the various staff on hand.  "
89210,8583218,2013-11-06,5364756,Elizabeth,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow was great!  Super dog friendly, comfortable and quiet.  Nice garden and a pretty view.  Our stay was short, but sweet.  Would definitely recommend this place to our friends.  "
89210,8607028,2013-11-07,7107853,Danielle Norita,"We sadly did not get to meet Sarah but Evan was a lovely guy and a very welcoming host, as was Zeus who may be the cutest dog I've ever seen. The bedroom was cosy with a lovely view to the sea. We were very grateful for the aquarium passes and Evan's recommendations for food and drink. It's a shame we couldn't have stayed longer. "
89210,8713167,2013-11-13,7989971,Lindsey,"Our family had a wonderful time staying at the beautiful bungalow, CA Dreaming.  Evan was very helpful with recommendations on local restaurants and things to see and do.  The location was centrally located for easy trips to Monterey and Carmel.  The eclectic record collection was a hit with us.  We highly recommend CA Dreaming  to anyone looking for a comfortable home away from home."
89210,8745071,2013-11-15,9508093,Filipe,"Evan was a very nice hoster. He kindly received us prior to check-in time in order to provide us the Acquarium tickets in advance.
He helped us to show turistic points, gave us maps and also recommendations of good places to eat and have drinks.
The place was very clean, and everything comfortable as described.
Nice dog as well!"
89210,8780265,2013-11-18,623413,Katherine,"We stayed with Evan and the adorable Zeus for the 2013 Big Sur Half Marathon. The space is beautiful (think ""California zen""), warm with many leafy indoor plants, and the bungalow has an amazing skylight shower that Evan designed himself. Evan was such a great host: he shared wonderful stories, gave us great food recommendations and was very flexible when we last-minute increased our party to 9 people. Even with a big group, there was enough space in the bungalow and main house for all of us to sleep and relax comfortably. Highly recommended for your visit to Monterey!"
89210,8895815,2013-11-25,8040382,Angie & Jacq,"Staying at Sarah and Evan’s bungalow was one of the highlights of our trip. We arrived a day earlier than expected and they were flexible in accommodating us. We didn’t have the pleasure of meeting Sarah as she was out of town, but Evan was absolutely delightful. His insight, kindness and generosity was so refreshing. He designed a beautiful and peaceful space – Japanese Zen –with a very comfortable bed and an amazing shower with skylight. The view was lovely and the garden was luscious. Loved the nice touches such as tickets to the Aquarium, books on Big Sur hikes, and a turntable with a great record collection! Looking forward to staying here again when back in the US."
89210,8961363,2013-11-28,2501346,Loraine,"My family loved Evan's place, the comfy beds, vintage records, and soothing Japanese decor and garden area. Evan has a great sense of humor and mellow nature that my kids enjoyed.  The location was ideal for a run on the beach, the guest tickets to the Monterey bay aquarium and his great tips about the surrounding area and restaurants were much appreciated.  Evan's place is much more homey and spacious than any cramped hotel room you'd find in the area. Highly wxommend."
89210,8981008,2013-11-30,824953,Jessica,"Evan was a WONDERFUL host. My boyfriend and I come into town with a few ideas of what we wanted to do, but Evan pointed us in all the right directions. We spent a full morning exploring the aquarium with the passes provided, and the afternoon riding down Big Sur, stopping at all the places Evan had mentioned (along with tour books and maps he provided). It was amazing. We ate at a cute breakfast place downtown that he pointed us to, and had one of the best breakfasts' on our trip there. All around a great time, and I would definitely recommend staying here. Oh, and did I mention waking up to a view of the ocean from your bed? And the records and record player were a major plus as well!"
89210,9022118,2013-12-02,389884,Deidre,We had a wonderful stay at the bungalow.  It's very serene and peaceful with a fantastic view. It was very comfortable for our family of 4 (a 5 & an 8 yr old).  The king sized bed was heavenly.  The location of the unit was very convenient. Evan was very helpful and responsive throughout the process.  We would definitely stay here again if we're in the area. 
89210,9198848,2013-12-12,7725864,Alex,We stayed here with our dog for one night on our way from LA to SF and it was wonderful. The environment is so relaxing and the view is gorgeous. Evan was very helpful recommending places to go in Pacific Grove and SF. I would love to return. 
89210,9217767,2013-12-14,49099,Elfe,"Evin was a very accommodating host! He gave us lots of recommendations, the space was clean and beautiful! My brother and I were visiting from out of town and this was our first time in Monterey. You really need more than a day there to take in everything, but I will certainly be staying in touch with Evin for next time I'm there! 

"
89210,9317686,2013-12-21,3740633,Cait,"My parents and I stayed here and had an incredible week. The view was gorgeous, the vinyls were great fun, and Evan was an excellent host. Would definitely come back."
89210,9374155,2013-12-24,9638745,Katherine,"Great little bungalow! Evin was very helpful in giving advice on places to visit/eat/hike, their dog Zeus is adorable and we had a lot of fun hanging out with him. Skylight in the shower was awesome!"
89210,9426704,2013-12-28,9525352,Don,"This was such an enjoyable experience. We stayed Xmas Eve and Xmas Day and Sarah and Evan were not around but they had a stand in host who was very charming and handled all our requests perfectly.  The location is private and quiet and the bed is absolutely perfection to sleep on.  I must find out what brand it is as would like to have one like it.  
There is a kitchen of sorts, but barely, so my suggestion would be to bring simple things for breakfast and maybe snacks but plan to eat out for other meals. The location is at the top of a hill, looking way down to the ocean so biking and walking in the area does include hills. But if you don't mind the hills, one can get to town easily on bike and possibly even on foot  It is the trek back that could be daunting.  This is a wonderful spot, a ""what's not to like"" and very comfortable."
89210,9467178,2013-12-30,9510247,Marianne,"We had a fantastic getaway up north from LA. The cottage is great, has an incredible view, and is so cozy. We didn't meet Sarah, but Evan was very welcoming and made us comfortable to ask for anything we could possibly need. He also was full of very good suggestions on where to eat, hike, and how to navigate the aquarium. Thanks so much from both of us, Evan and Sarah!"
89210,9543561,2014-01-02,4117982,Leïla,"My husband and I are very happy we chose to stay at Evan & Sarah. Evan was an amazing host. He gave us very good tips for hiking and dining (He made a reservation for this incredible vegetarian restaurant called Julia's). The house ambiance is warm and welcoming. Love the room we stayed in: the ""CA Dreaming w/Ocean View, 2 Aq. tix"". Separate from the house, the room is very cozy, spacious, clean and with a super comfy bed (from the bed you can see the Monterrey bay in the mornings) and i beautiful large bathroom. The bathroom has an unexpected skylight on the shower where you can see the stars at night. Their dog Zeus is such a cute delight, he would become us every time we’d arrived to the house.  We had fascinating but shot talks with Evan and his friend. Definitely we would love to come back!"
89210,9724616,2014-01-06,7508521,Greg,"Perfect stay, thank you Sarah and Evan!"
89210,9818465,2014-01-12,937426,Nancy,"We didn't get to meet Sarah and Evan, but had a great stay anyway. Zeus and Robert were our hosts. It was a quiet weekend, enjoyed the aquarium, painted, made ourselves at home, listened to great music by the fire. LOVE the bathroom and shower! Slept well. Such a great central local but quiet too. Thanks!
"
89210,9858650,2014-01-14,4185239,Arielle,"We did not meet Sarah and Evan during our stay, but their guest host made us comfortable.  Beautiful, comfortable space.  Loved the record player and shower.  With the Aquarium passes, it is a fantastic deal!"
89210,9875182,2014-01-16,10201275,Kacy,"I can't say enough about our stay at this beautiful spot in Pacific Grove. Even though our hosts were out of town, the visiting host, Robert, was very accommodating and a joy to be around. We can't wait to stay here again and encourage others to do so as well. Thanks, Sarah & Evan, for making this place so magical."
89210,9906152,2014-01-18,9879573,Ivy & Sean,"This was our first AirBnB stay, and WOW, Sarah and CA Dreaming sure set the bar high!! Waking up to a fabulous view of the ocean, the large shower with the sun pouring in from the skylight, Zeus (their adorable pup) greeting you as you come and go, and being just minutes from the Aquarium, picturesque beaches and Refuge Spa...we had such a wonderful time! Sarah was an absolute pleasure, and a joy to talk to - she made us feel right at home, more like an old friend than a temporary guest.  We are already talking about our next trip, will base it around CA Dreaming's availability! "
89210,9955351,2014-01-21,10152068,Molly,"Sarah & Evan's home was the perfect place to stay during our trip. The room was clean, quiet, and so comfortable. It was also so much fun getting to know Sarah (Evan was out of the country) & she gave us great recommendations of where to go to dinner & what to see during our day trips. She was also kind enough to let us cook breakfast in the main house & even let us help ourselves to her food-so kind! If we come back this is definitely where we'll stay! Thanks again Sarah!"
89210,10016146,2014-01-25,11156827,Gail,We had a wonderful time at Sarah and Evan wonderful house.  They were perfect hosts.  We really enjoyed them as well as their comfy bed.

89210,10154417,2014-02-03,320052,Jonathan,A lovely little space. The garden was quite relaxing and we were able to walk to the aquarium. My only regret was not finding any vinyl at the jumble sales we passed to leave with the record player.
89210,10200712,2014-02-05,75958,Helen,"Sarah and Evan were perfect hosts. We were given suggestions for restaurants (Julia's and Holly's), where to park for free near our destinations, use of the Aquarium passes and tips for golf. The accommodations were very comfortable and calming, a great vinyl collection, and lovely bathroom. Definitely a patio and ""room with a view"". I wish we could have stayed longer but we will be back. My head is swimming with jellies, kelp, monarch butterflies, crashing waves and several pars. Two perfect days with the love of my life!      "
89210,10237755,2014-02-08,10607669,Sirisha,"Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts! They provided a very nice, peaceful, clean room and spent time telling us about things we could do in Monterey, Carmel and Big Sur. I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Monterey to stay at their place!"
89210,10262663,2014-02-10,10924085,Jeanne,"Sarah and Evan were very welcoming. They had lots of suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the area. There is also a stack of guide maps/books in this room for you to browse at your leisure.
This room is as awesome/luxurious/intimate as the photos and description suggest!  I LOVE LOVE the open shower!!  
It was a little bit chilly and rainy when we were here, but it wasn't so bad in this room.  We also had a small space heater that kept us comfortable.  
There was a record player with an old vinyl collection, and typed-out instructions for how to use the record player.  (They thought of everything!)  Fantastic!"
89210,10298580,2014-02-11,18388,Karin,"We were blown away by the great studio that Sarah & Evan have in their back yard! The main room is spacious with a huge king-sized bed that was dreamy & very comfortable. All of the amenities provided-coffee pot(s), coffee, tea, water, small fridge were all great for the am java blast. We thoroughly enjoyed the record player (it's been sooo long since listening to one-& the album collection was perfect). Evan welcomed us with open arms & a small cache of treats for the ADORABLE Zeus!  I loved him! I do have to admit (besides our hosts & Zeus) the shower & skylight was my favorite! it rained while we were there but I had the skylight open during my shower! double wonderful! Everything plus the Aquarium tickets were more than we could ask for! Thank you, thank you, thank you for a bit of heaven (& a view when the clouds cleared)! We enjoyed our stay more than you know."
89210,10356665,2014-02-15,8185574,Thomas And Coumba,"Sarah and Evan are two wonderful hosts who instantly made us feel at ease and at home! 
The bungalow was the perfect place for our little family: cosy, clean and with a beautiful ocean view right from the bed! 
It is also very conveniently located in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood but still very close to all local attractions. The complementary passes to the aquarium are also a very nice addition!
We will definitely go back without hesitation!! "
89210,10373194,2014-02-16,11985361,Russell,"This was our first Airbnb, and, like the others for whom Sarah and Evan were the first hosts, they truly did set the bar high!  They were always responsive in their communication, and when we arrived my girlfriend and I were blown away by the accommodation - the bungalow is stunning, a work of art in itself...the main space is both warm and inspiring, we leapt right into their record collection, the bed was, indeed, incredibly comfortable, the self-designed bathroom was spectacular...and more than anything my girlfriend and I truly felt welcomed and appreciated by the gracious hospitality provided by Sarah and Evan.  This is an exceptional airbnb, and I look forward to contacting them again next time we're in town.  Thank you!!"
89210,10423483,2014-02-18,7400104,Renato,"Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts!  They were full of local tips, helpful with insider restaurants and have a cool little dog in Zeus.  The bungalow is at the end of a cul de sac and has peaceful views of the ocean.  We highly recommend staying here!"
89210,10450109,2014-02-19,722161,Daniel,"Having driven a whole day from SF along the coast, myself and my partner were ready to relax and sleep over in advance of the bigger drive further south to Big Sur. We couldn't have dreamed of a better setting in Pacific Grove. Sarah and Even were consummate hosts, quickly putting us at ease and recommending a great local restaurant (Hula's, if you're wondering). We didn't stay for long, only one night - we wanted to keep moving - but they were helpful with suggestions and options for our road trip, and full of great conversations. If we're in the area again we'll definitely seek this spot out - clean, cosy, with a clear view of the sea and a great sense of space... highly recommended!"
89210,10471694,2014-02-20,11663094,Katherine,"Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts and very friendly.  They gave us the aquarium passes and gave great suggestions on where to go for fun and good food.  The bungalow was so comfortable and beautiful. There was a record player that we loved and listened to as many as we could.  We brought breakfast back to eat in the patio, it was so tranquil. Thanks!"
89210,10503446,2014-02-22,1315732,Lois,"Sarah and Evan were warm and helpful, and their place was cute and comfortable.  The bed in the bungalow, with it's view of the water, was extremely comfortable, and the excellent coffee and tea that were provided gave us a delicious boost in the morning.  We wish we were there right now! "

89210,10589435,2014-02-26,5958195,Debra,"Our host's were awesome, very easy going and very attentive to anything we might need. Room and ocean view were perfect for our romantic weekend. We loved Zeus and will look forward to our next visit with Evan and Sarah.  "
89210,10730849,2014-03-04,12478076,Kate,Such a cute place! And Sarah was so helpful! Her recommendation for a place to eat our first night was our favorite meal! The aquarium was so close and fun! 
89210,10751359,2014-03-05,828646,Plumeria,Sarah and Evan were so welcoming and helpful. The cottage is the sweetest place to stay. A fantastic accomadtion. Thanks so much!!
89210,10795354,2014-03-08,2374619,Adam & Destiny,"We spent three nights at Sarah and Evan's beautiful bungalow, and we enjoyed every minute. You will be hard-pressed to find anywhere else to stay in this area that matches the beauty, comfort, and proximity to the area's attractions for the price! 

You can see the ocean from the back patio, and the morning mist over the water is lovely. We had plenty of space in the room and all the little extras that make a place feel homey - a selection of coffees and teas, a mini-fridge, shampoo/conditioner, delicious chocolate truffles from our hosts, utensils, towels, etc. We felt like we were staying in a boutique hotel. The shower is an amazing experience in and of itself with a skylight above it so you can see the clouds and trees. It's the definition of spa relaxation. The Asian/Zen theme is tasteful and fit the room very well. We also had a blast listening to genuine album records on their record player (our first time)! 

We really liked that you can access the bungalow from a gate on the side of the yard, even though they said they didn't mind if we accessed it through their house. It gave us peace of mind to know we weren't disturbing them with our comings and goings. The location is prime in Pacific Grove - we took convenient day trips to Big Sur and Carmel, and we spent lots of time in the immediate Monterey Bay area exploring Cannery Row, the Aquarium, and local restaurants. Did I mention the stay comes with two free tickets to the Aquarium?! This was a great perk for us since we were planning on going to the Aquarium anyway, and we were not disappointed! At the end of our busy days site-seeing, we looked forward to coming back each night to our little home away from home.

Our hosts were wonderful. Sarah and Evan answered all of our questions, were so hospitable and accommodating, and just all-around good people. We highly recommend staying here!"
89210,10841626,2014-03-10,10550497,Nicholas,"Sarah and Evan are amazing people and great hosts!  Even though I was running a bit early, Evan was accommodating enough to let me check-in.  The view from the bungalow is gorgeous (as shown in their photos) and the beach is super close.  The record player was a nice touch as listening to ""Dark Side of the Moon"" on vinyl was a trip!  I definitely recommend staying with Sarah and Evan."
89210,10890793,2014-03-11,736903,Jeremy,"Evan and Sarah were perfect hosts. Upon arrival, Evan greeted us with enthusiastic recommendations of the best trails with tips and gems only a local could offer (we were headed to Big Sur for a week of hiking). Evan also saved us from an inferior dinner we had researched beforehand and he pointed us to the BEST restaurant recommendation I have ever received from a host: if you are in Pacific Grove on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday (the only days it's open) you *must* visit Julia's! Also, stay with Sarah and Evan; their bungelow is perfect!"
89210,10921749,2014-03-13,5198383,Thomas,This was our first stay with AirBnB and we are so glad it was with Sarah and Evan! They shared their lovely home with us and our experience was 10x better because of their advice during our stay.   Wonderful! 
89210,11090617,2014-03-20,11059553,Yvette,"My family truly enjoyed the authentic California experience staying with Evan.  We loved the comfort and space in the ""cottage"" and felt truly at home in the house and yard.  Evan's advice on where to visit was invaluable.  Having two passes to the aquarium was a nice perk, too.  The location of the house was fantastic for visiting Monterey, Carmel, Pebble Beach, and Big Sur.  Staying with Evan felt like visiting family.  Thank you!!!
"
89210,11177790,2014-03-24,9748023,Caitlin,"Really lovely, relaxing, and fantastic listing located very centrally to anything you'd like to do in the Monterey area. Sarah and Evan were perfect hosts: friendly and helpful while still allowing my mom and I plenty of space and time. The bungalow itself is exactly as described and more. Definitely recommend this place if you'll be visiting Monterey--the accommodations and local knowledge/insider tips we got definitely helped to make a great vacation."
89210,11297751,2014-03-29,11525797,Geoffrey,We had a wonderful stay and slept in one of the most comfortable beds. The view of the garden and out to the ocean is stunning. Evan was most helpful with local knowledge and the tickets to the aquarium are a great bonus. Also fell in love with Zeus who came to visit us every morning.
89210,11455059,2014-04-03,9755999,Jill,"Beautiful views, comfortable abode, and quite serene.  I'd definitely stay again!  Oh, and the bathroom/shower were amazing!    "
89210,11487945,2014-04-05,1463059,Carlos,"This a fantastic spot, and Evan was a superb host! The apartment is super comfortable and well equipped. Highlights include the king bed, huge bathroom (with skylight that opens for a fresh air shower experience), and courtyard with ocean view. The apartment is perfectly situated to explore the region, and Evan gave us fantastic tips for restaurants in town and hikes in Big Sur. Two thumbs way up!"
89210,11542178,2014-04-07,12536073,Cybele,"What a beautiful room! We LOVED our stay in Pacific Grove at Sarah and Evan's - the room was meticulous and elegant, our host was so personable and charming - we felt extremely well cared for, and definitely plan to go back. Highly, highly recommended!"
89210,11662800,2014-04-11,12708047,Sheri,It was wonderful.  Both Evan and Sara were very warm and we felt very at home.  It was so great for our dog.  Fenced in gorgeous yard and Ocean View.....the BEST bed EVER...we would stay there again...anyday....and would recommend it to anyone.  The cottage is beautiful and new....with a shower with a open air window...very zen and relaxing for sure
89210,11826362,2014-04-16,7554167,Gerald,"Superb location, good people who know the area."
89210,11979427,2014-04-20,4239507,Kemi,We had a lovely and relaxing stay. The unit is beautiful and bed so big and comfortable! There was a warmth in the home and in our interactions with Evan that was wonderful. And the opportunity to visit the amazing aquarium was such a magnificent part of our stay. A wonderful and much needed respite for our hearts and spirits.
89210,12054045,2014-04-22,9523191,Jennifer,Our family had a wonderful time at Evin and Sarah's beautiful home.  The views of the ocean and the outside seating in the garden were an extra treat.  My sister Kate brought her tiny dog and found easy walking areas to take her for a quick stroll.  We felt very much at home and well taken care of and especially enjoyed getting to meet our generous hosts.  The shower in the studio was gorgeous with a sky light and the studio came with an amazing collection of records that took us by surprise.  Thank you.
89210,12165642,2014-04-24,13180354,Cynthia,"We woke up to the sound of chimes and of running water, and a view of a beautiful garden and of the ocean (whales, optional). It didn't come with breakfast, but the welcome that Sarah, Evan, Josh, and Zeus gave us was warm, generous, and very personal. Some Airbnb spaces are great because there is little or no interaction with the hosts. This one was made more beautiful by meeting the Bakers. More than highly recommended!"
89210,12189862,2014-04-25,1722994,Tiffany,"Really cute place!  We only stayed for one night, but would def stay here for longer if we had the time.  We especially enjoyed browsing the record collection and the bathroom was a great ""outdoor"" shower experience.  Highly recommend."
89210,12214821,2014-04-26,10163270,Danielle,"Sarah and Evan are wonderful hosts! The bungalow is perfect and exactly as described.  Parking is easy and the town of Monterey was fantastic, made better by all of Sarah's excellent recommendations.  Zeus is the sweetest dog and part of me wanted to take him home!  This is an excellent place to stay and I would be hard pressed to find more lovely hosts than Sarah and Evan.  "
89210,12391697,2014-05-01,10964881,Jonathan,"This place was so beautiful with a wonderful zen feeling. Sarah and Evan were such gracious hosts and offered great suggestions for dining. We would have loved to have stayed for longer.
 Perfect place that we would recommend to anyone!"
89210,12737840,2014-05-10,1971634,Sandy,"The bungalow was the perfect place for us to stay in the Monterey area. We loved the decor, ocean view, garden, location, and privacy of the place. Sarah, Evan, and Josh are wonderful people and great hosts. And Zeus is a delightful and sweet dog that we fell in love with. We will definitely return the next time we are back in the area. Thank you Sarah and Evan for offering such a beautiful relaxing home away from home."
89210,12974184,2014-05-16,9971639,Rick And Linda,"Sarah and Evan were great, very positive and easy going.  This was a new experence for me, I have not traveled much, and after only staying in motels, hotels, and a couple of bed-and-breakfast inns, this was more like staying with family.  Their son was home from college and he was plesant and comfortable to be around.  Then there is ""Zeus"" one doggie treat and you have a friend for life (but I would leave spolling him to Sarah and Evan ). The view from the patio and the suite is amazing."
89210,13175319,2014-05-21,3119102,Lars,"....and we were wondering why this place was booked all the time. now we know why :)
perfect place to stay and an even nicer family to stay with! we would love to return here anytime. there are so many good reviews up here already, read them, they are true :)"
89210,13302835,2014-05-25,11656679,Friederike,We enjoyed our stay in the bungalow very much! The bed is very comfortable and you can see the ocean when you wake up. We would book again!
89210,13466197,2014-05-28,11912358,Jeffrey,"Nice accomadations, quiet neighborhood. Close to the coast, 17 mile drive and downtown Monterey and Cannery Row."
89210,13742587,2014-06-03,5208684,Evelyn,"Staying with Sarah & Evan was the best Airbnb experience I ever had. The warm hospitality made me feel better than staying in a 5 star hotel suite. Sarah & Evan are very detailed with their bungalow. Being a pretty fussy traveler, I only have praises for them. The mattress and bedsheets are definitely comparable or even better than most luxury hotels. Their garden is so beautiful with a breathtaking view overlooking the ocean. It's a MUST stay with them.. Highly recommended... "
89210,13852715,2014-06-06,15227335,Rikus,"We had a fantastic experience here. The central location and aquarium tickets were great, but what brought it from just good to fantastic was the personal touch that Sarah and Evan put in to our experience there. The room is great, with a very nice, large shower, ridiculously comfortable bed, and I especially enjoyed the vinyl collection we listened to while relaxing. The garden and surroundings/view make this a very serene place to relax and just enjoy each other's company (one of the reasons we loved this place is that there is no television). Also, Sarah had some fantastic recommendations about how to enjoy our time in Monterey and they were spot on. And lastly, we love us some Zeus. He got along fantastically with the dog we brought, and even hung out with us on occasion while we got ready to go enjoy the area. We would have stolen him, but that would've meant that we couldn't come back and stay here in the future, which we definitely plan to do."
89210,13945364,2014-06-09,1793564,Charles,"Host were very nice, friendly and accomodating. The room was comfy and quiet, and had everything I needed.  After returning quite dirty from a Spartan Race, Evan even offer to wash my dirty clothes for me. And Sarah made sure I did not have to consume any BPAs :-)
This review is actually for the Room in the house, as I swapped with another couple for the Bungalow."
89210,14145063,2014-06-13,12351717,Lee,"Great hosts and a great little location. Zeus is the perfect little guard dog and very friendly. We were free to come and go as we pleased and we even got to do some whale watching from the from the garden! Thanks we had a great stay, the room was very cool."
89210,14425367,2014-06-19,12799982,Kristy,"I stayed here for four nights with my two little dogs, and we had a GREAT time! I didn't meet Evan, but Sarah was ready with maps of the surrounding areas, asking what kind of things I wanted to do and marking the maps up for me. Sarah and Zeus were excellent hosts; my dogs loved Zeus and always wanted to go out and play in the backyard if he was out. (One time they begged to go out, but when they went out and realized Zeus wasn't there, they came back inside and moped.) The shower was wonderful and the bed was amazingly comfortable! The neighborhood was quiet and secluded so we took a lot of blissful, rejuvenating naps. We had such a great time in Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel, and we definitely will be back - and this is where we'll want to stay!"
89210,14702573,2014-06-24,11180290,Gelareh,We had the most amazing time staying with Sarah and Evan!  We were originally planning to go out in the evening and explore Carmel etc. but we felt so comfortable and so relaxed that decided to stay in and leave the exploration for the following day.  We had our best night sleep in weeks!!!!!
89210,14773456,2014-06-26,5259170,Connie,The Bungalow was very cute and cosy.  We really enjoyed our time there and it is a great base for all the pacific coast area has to offer.  Sarah was very knowledgeable and friendly and gave us GREAT suggestions for what to do and what to eat.  We can't wait to come back.  :-)
89210,14818674,2014-06-27,5259170,Connie,"This was an extension of our stay.  We are so glad we did, just gave us more time to enjoy the area! Thanks again Sarah!"
89210,14951168,2014-06-30,2257468,Andy,"Sarah & Evan are the most pleasant and helpful hosts you can imagine. The bungalow is really a large room attached to the main house (but with no door between them) with a very comfortable bed, a very spacious private bathroom with a large open shower (2 people fit easily) and a small storage area with a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. There is no sink so I wouldn't quite call it a kitchen, but Sarah & Evan are serious when they say that the main house with full kitchen is yours to use whenever you like. The entire front of the bungalow is a large sliding glass door which overlooks the ocean about a mile away, there is sometimes fog but we saw the ocean clearly 2 days out of 3. Pacific Grove is quaint and quiet, in my view much more of a jewel than Monterey, which has become terribly kitschy around the aquarium. Distances in the area are short BUT STEEP - you can drive to downtown Pacific Grove in 3-4 minutes, to the aquarium in maybe 7, to Carmel in 10-15. It's a wonderful place for a relaxing vacation with or without the kids."
89210,15078307,2014-07-01,17214026,Shaila,"Sarah and Evan's place is welcoming, peaceful and comfortable.  Zeus is a wonderful companion.  It is conveniently located to all the beautiful sights in Carmel and Monterey.  "
89210,15123956,2014-07-02,17348646,Applejoy,Had such an amazing time in Monterey and staying at Sarah's and Evans bungalow was a very nice and quiet place. Enjoyed the spacious shower. Their member card for the aquarium was very convenient and the restaurant they suggested was awesome. Definitely would recommend their place to stay at. Wish we would've stayed longer. Thank you Sarah and Evan! P.S we are now ENGAGED! :)
89210,15307179,2014-07-07,10490272,Emily,"Sarah, Evan and Zeus are so welcoming, accommodating and helpful - they made us feel like old friends stopping in for a weekend!
Their suggestions and advice on things to do in the area made our short stay so much more enjoyable.  
We can't wait to go back!"
89210,15396908,2014-07-08,14813258,Frances,"This place was wonderful, as were the hosts! Beautiful spot, super comfy bed, and great location!"
89210,15888868,2014-07-17,16444001,Lucheng,We had a great time!  Sarah's very warm and friendly and she made us feel right at home.   She has great insights on places to see and how to get around the town.  The bed's super comfy and the place is clean.  The garden is beautifully maintained I just wish we could stayed longer to fully enjoy it.  And best of all our kid is attached to Zeus we had a hard time pulling him away.  I'd definite recommend this and would like to come back again.
89210,16142668,2014-07-22,17715857,Joseph,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and because of the hospitality of Sarah and Evan, it will not be our last. The accommodations were sublime, the guidance and tips from Sarah were invaluable, and our time in Pacific Grove/Monterey couldn't have been more lovely. We absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVED it!!! Do yourself a favor and book with Sarah and Evan, and Zeus too!"
89210,16312867,2014-07-25,6571529,Jessica,"Sarah and Evan's beautiful home was the perfect place for my parents and I to kick off our coastal road trip. Sarah and Evan were incredibly welcoming and helpful; Evan had a ton of tips for making the most of our time in Monterey and Big Sur. The bungalow was perfect: comfortable beds, a bunch of great records, and an adorable garden for reading and drinking coffee. The location of their home is perfect for exploring the area. It's close (less than 10 minutes) to everything we wanted to do/see. Also, we loved Zeus. "
89210,16392723,2014-07-27,12741327,Stan,"Can't imagine better hosts than Sarah and Evan. Totally welcoming and expert advisors on area attractions and restaurants. Very easy to communicate and really caring about your experience.
We asked about using a washer and dryer as this was part of a 10 day trip and Sarah ended up doing our laundry for us! What else can you ask for?
Place was spotless and exactly as advertised. Great value for the area."
89210,16476417,2014-07-28,16105380,Marilyn,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow is a warm, comfortable and inviting room with a beautifully sunlit bathroom and small kitchenette. The setting, opening to their tranquil garden and adjacent to their home, is peaceful and relaxing. Their vinyl record collection was a bonus for me and my daughter! I can't say enough about these welcoming hosts - Sarah, Evan and Josh. They are a wonderful family, and provided us with all the assistance we asked for and more. And in case you need advice for a college search, ask Evan and Josh - they will share their trove of incredibly helpful info!"
89210,16703767,2014-08-01,13415849,Jennifer,"Evan and Sarah were warm and welcoming, we felt very comfortable and enjoyed our stay. "
89210,17037713,2014-08-06,6117195,Mary,"Sarah and Evan made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. Sarah talked us through the local places ( Pacific Grove, Monterey) as well as where to go on the Big Sur, which we had come to see. She gave us maps and lent us guidebooks and her help really made a difference to how we organised our time.
 The room is separate from the main house and has large sliding glass doors so that you can see the garden and the view of the Pacific beyond. We had a kitchen area with a fridge and a lovely bathroom with a walk in shower. The bed was enormous and very comfortable.
 Sarah and Evan had left their record collection for us to play, which was great, although I overindulged in Barry Manilow and the Bee Gees and afterwards couldn't get their songs out of my head! 
 On the second day I mentioned to Evan that I might do some hand washing and hang it out, and he immediately gave us access to the family washing machine and drier, which I thought was very generous. 
 It's a peaceful, calm place to stay, and only walking distance ( or a short drive) from a Trader Joe's and a couple of really nice restaurants ( try Julia's which is fab).  
 It's a lovely place to stay. Thoroughly recommended!"
89210,17234349,2014-08-09,18839458,Mariam,"Sarah and Evan made our first Airbnb stay a positive experience. They made us feel welcomed and very comfortable. Their recommendations   and tips  on restaurants and area attractions helped us to make the most of our time on our three day vacation.
The room was comfortable and clean, but the lovely garden and patio were our  favorites for drinking our morning coffee, and reading with a glass of CA wine, of course, late afternoons!
When in the area, go stay with Sarah and Evan. You will not be disappointed.
 "
89210,17309865,2014-08-10,19073144,Mauren,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was great! Sarah was welcoming and friendly, gave us great restaurant suggestions and directions, and gave us excellent information about how to maximize our visit to the aquarium (which was awesome!). 
The bunglow was comfortable, well-laid out and very clean. We had clean sheets and towels, and access to Evan and Sarah's vinyl collection! Listening to Simon and Garfunkel while reading on their oceanview patio was not a bad way to spend our Saturday evening. 
We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this bungalow to anyone! "
89210,17431646,2014-08-12,8377014,G,"Really lovely experience staying with Sarah and Zeus (charming 3 legged & blind dog). Our kids loved him; we loved the walk-in shower and kingsize bed. Sarah couldn't be more helpful with advice and accommodating in allowing us use of her home. Pacific Grove's coastline & beaches are beautiful; Monterey's great for the kids. Altogether, a 5 out of 5 experience. Thank you. "
89210,17525894,2014-08-13,11637728,Yi,"This was our first Airbnb experience,and it was wonderful!!Sarah and Evan were very nice and friendly.They made us feel welcomed and comfortable.The bungalow was cute and clean,and we enjoyed sitting at garden to eat our breakfast.We really enjoyed our time in there,and thank again Sarah and Evan!!"
89210,17827867,2014-08-18,16004079,Ivar,I enjoyed my stay. Sarah and Evan were very helpful and gracious hosts. Especially enjoyed the bakery recommendation. Cozy room with very nice skylit shower.

Thanks Evan & Sarah"
89210,18051861,2014-08-21,9040912,Piers,"We had a great stay.  Pacific Grove was the perfect start to our honeymoon.  Evan greeted us and gave us plenty of thoughtful recommendations for eating, hiking, and getting around Monterey.  We stayed for two nights in the private guest bungalow.  Enjoyed sipping on wine and eating cheese in their beautiful garden.  We highly recommend this place for a relaxing, comfortable experience.  "
89210,18228221,2014-08-24,13740735,Kathleen,Our hosts made us feel welcome. They toured the suite with us so that we were clear about location and operation of room items. Their suite is located in a quiet pleasant neighborhood. 
89210,18515340,2014-08-28,11115171,Beate,"Wir haben uns bei Sarah und Even zuhause gefüehlt.
Sind als Fremde gekommen und als Freunde gefahren.
Besser geht es nicht.
Der Abschied war schwer."

89210,18705446,2014-08-31,3577489,Helen,A lovely studio in a beautiful town.  Very clean and comfortable with THE most fantastic bed we've ever slept in! Evan was friendly and accommodating with lots of great tips for what to see and do in the local area.
89210,18877089,2014-09-02,7920229,Liz,"My husband and I LOVED our stay in PG!  The listing was accurate (and as usual, in my experience, better than advertised).  Evan was super welcoming and very resourceful/helpful in our plans for the weekend.  Evan was also very accommodating to our schedule -- he let us drop off our stuff before check-in so we could refrigerate some cold foods that we brought and he was also flexible on check-out since the next guests were coming in late.  

The space was quiet and beautiful, really private too.  We absolutely adored their dog, Zeus, he was a welcome member every morning to our breakfast nook (Ethan did make sure that Zeus wasn't bothering us, for those who may not like dogs...I'm unsure if those kinds of people exist, though).  

We had so much fun in the area but also really enjoyed just relaxing with wine and listening to as much of the provided vinyl records as possible (Hank Williams, Philadelphia Orchestra, and Frank Sinatra were our favorites)!  Thank you SO much Evan and Sarah for opening up your home and letting us use the Aquarium guest passes:)  We thoroughly enjoyed our time. "
89210,19027471,2014-09-05,4936739,Bindia,"Our stay here was perfect. The accommodation was beautifully furnished and you cannot beat the location. Evan was wonderful - he has in depth knowledge of the area, the beaches and the hikes and was available for guidance. My son also enjoyed playing the piano daily and spending time with Zeus.  We felt like we were at home!  We would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this home."
89210,19121334,2014-09-07,6335486,Lelania,What a wonderful experience! Evan was there to greet us and provide some great local tips...must take his restaurant advice! The place was so comfortable and charming...felt like home! Pacific Grove is one of my favorite new neighborhoods! Can't wait to visit again!!
89210,19232914,2014-09-08,4152359,Christopher,"Excellent place to stay if you're making your way up or down the coast, or even as fun weekend getaway. Evan's communication is good, and you simply can't ignore the free aquarium passes. Go to the aquarium!!"
89210,19409646,2014-09-12,17562266,Eric-Marie,"Great place indeed. Perfectly and quietly situated just between Monterey and Carmel. Very easy to drive both. Quite confortable and, this is the point, moreover an unusual friendly and charming welcoming from Sarah & Evan. Direct, simple, and delightfull ! A pity we didn't shared time enough to talk about music, travelling and shared collection of old 60's records from golden age !"
89210,19591028,2014-09-15,15586637,Jonathan,"The place was great and not a far drive to lots of places nearby. Sarah was a perfect host and had great recommendations for things to do. And of course, Zeus is the best!"
89210,19692780,2014-09-16,20438030,Sue,Evan was very welcoming and helped us with our travel plans. He provided a map which was helpful. He encouraged us to go to the aquarium which we loved ! The description was perfect and the neighborhood was close to everything that we wanted to see.  The space is absolutely beautiful and is perfect for a getaway . We only wished we had more time . 
89210,19815047,2014-09-19,15294890,Caroline And Ed,"We really enjoyed our stay here. We didn't meet Sarah but Evan, Josh and Zeus the dog were very friendly and Evan was a wealth of information about the local area, places to eat and good walks.  Use the Aquarium tickets of you do stay here, really worth it.

Photos are a v good representation of the space and this was the biggest and comfiest bed we stayed in all trip. "
89210,20000515,2014-09-22,7897941,Merrill,"Nice people, pretty room, very comfortable bed.  Would-be visitors should be advised that they will need a car to get around, there is no actual kitchen, and it is not possible to lock the door to the room. The garden is very attractive.  "
89210,20273881,2014-09-27,11259564,Alyia,"Believe the hype! Sarah and Evan were lovely and gracious hosts from the beginning. Evan was even kind enough to get the space ready for us early when I spaced out the check in time due to a redeye flight. We loved the bungalow, especially the gorgeous garden with succulents galore, the glorious bed, and the open-air shower. We enjoyed chatting with them very much and found their advice on local spots extremely useful, but always felt that we had our privacy as well- this is a difficult trick to pull off, but they've mastered it! Pacific Grove is paradise, with beautiful foggy mornings, blue skies and cool breezes, and a million reasons to be outside. We miss it already and hope to go back someday. "
89210,20417670,2014-09-29,16179244,Jon,"My girlfriend and I visited Monterey for our first time this past weekend.  From the moment we arrived we were enthralled by the serenity of the 'California Dreaming' bungalow.  Sarah and Evan were especially wonderful and greeted us with unmatched kindness and hospitality.  They offered some great advice to ensure that our visit was care-free.  The complementary aquarium admission was icing on the cake.  What truly made the trip exquisite was the room.  The peaceful nature of this Japanese-themed bungalow set our minds at ease.  Waking up to a view of the ocean was a real treat.  Between the natural, sky-view shower and full record collection, we couldn't ask for a more soothing accommodation.  The home was also in very close proximity to countless shops, restaurants, and most importantly, the wharf.  We wish we could have stayed longer and will surely be back soon.  Thank you, Sarah and Evan!   "
89210,20543531,2014-09-30,572570,( We ) Are Nicole And John,"Sarah and Evan's little spot was so sweet and although our stay was brief, we thoroughly enjoyed our time there!  Everything was exactly as described, beautiful room, great view, and a plush and comfy bed :)  thanks so much for having us!  Hope you come for a visit to Pescadero!!"
89210,20647139,2014-10-03,4680122,Bruce And Karen,"We couldn't have enjoyed our stay here more. Wonderful bungalow, great hosts, ideal location. The pictures are accurate and the bed is as comfortable as advertised. Sarah and Evan were welcoming and gracious and extremely helpful and generous with touring and hiking suggestions during our three days there. We also took advantage of the aquarium passes and were quite impressed by it.  We would recommend this site to any visitor to Monterey."
89210,20742656,2014-10-05,598296,Natalie,"Sarah, Evan, and their son were wonderful hosts! Evan greeted us upon arrival and gave us the tour and we were able to check in a little early which was great. The garden is lovely and the cottage is very comfortable; had everything we needed and more. The bathroom was fabulous, the bed was enormous, and we enjoyed playing records during our stay. 

The whole family was very friendly, giving us great restaurant and beach suggestions that really made our weekend fun. They were available whenever we had questions, but also respected our privacy once we were in the cottage. We had lots of great conversations with Sarah and Evan in the garden. The neighborhood is very quiet and we enjoyed the tranquility; it was so peaceful waking up to the ocean view. 

Their dog, Zeus, was also very friendly and wanted to hang out with us and our pups. He's such a cutie! Overall, we had a lovely stay and we hope to see Sarah and Evan again!"
89210,20987425,2014-10-09,17426886,Dan,"My partner, David, and I  are from British Columbia and recently enjoyed a trip to central California.  We had the good fortune to be able to stay at California Dreaming w/Ocean View from Octob (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) .  We were warmly greeted by our hosts Sarah & Evan and their son Josh and pet dog - Zeus. We found our hosts to be very helpful through our entire stay beginning with a thorough orientation by Evan. In addition to information about our room, Evan provided us with a number of suggestions about local eateries and things to do. David and I really enjoyed our room and found it very clean. The bed was especially comfortable and our room was quiet. It was especially nice waking in the morning and looking out at the beautiful surroundings from our bed and watching the birds. Sitting out on the patio early in the morning with our wake up coffee was very special. It was almost difficult to leave our comfortable surroundings each day but eventually we did get out and took in some of the amazing surroundings and make special mention of Big Sur and Carmel (including a fantastic large beach area). We really enjoyed the food at restaurants in Pacific Grove and Carmel Valley and found the service to be very friendly. One of our favourite breakfast places in PG was Toasties on Lighthouse Avenue. Back to our room, our hosts were very good at checking in with us to see if we needed anything. We are dog lovers so enjoyed greetings from Zeus as we were coming and going and sometimes Zeus would just come over to our patio/room for a pet. We felt like we were at home away from home. David and I talked about the fact we could have used more vacation time at California Dreaming. There is just so much to see and great eateries just a short drive from where we were staying. Anyone reading this review can probably tell we kind of enjoyed all aspects of our stay."
89210,21198440,2014-10-13,12968730,Mark,"We had a wonderful stay at Evan and Sarah's lovely cottage.  We used it as our home base for our cycling trips to Monterey and Carmel, and it was perfectly located, just minutes from the 17 Mile Drive.  The accommodations were top notch.  A very comfortable mattress, a spacious shower, a microwave and mini-fridge took care of our basic needs.  But on top of that, the bungalow was delightfully decorated and cozy.  While we were welcomed to use the full kitchen in the main house, we had no need to take advantage of that kind gesture.  The weather was perfect, and after returning from one of our rides, we enjoyed reading out on the patio, looking up to see the ocean in the distance and hummingbirds tasting the flowers nearby.   Fabulous! "
89210,21348728,2014-10-15,17383801,Autumn,We enjoyed our stay at this Pacific Grove bungalow.  The aquarium is a very quick and easy drive from there.  The bungalow is decorated very nicely and has an extremely comfortable bed and an awesome bathroom.  The garden and outdoor area was really nice too. We stayed with our 9 month old baby and it worked out well.  We never met Evan but Sarah was very kind and accommodating.  
89210,21582178,2014-10-20,15837431,Pamela,"We gathered in Pacific Grove for a family Wedding and had the perfect lodging location with Sarah and Evan.
The room was as described, the setting was exceptionally lovely. We could see the ocean from the bed! The weather happened to be nearly perfect for our entire trip. The hosts were gracious and accommodating. They went above and beyond expectations!
I would love to stay there again one day!"
89210,21746711,2014-10-23,21259622,Susan,"We had a wonderful stay in Sara and Evan's bungalow. The room is clean and well decorated. It's a great location close to aquarium and 17 miles. Sara is warm and gave us nice tips on restaurants, etc. It was a great experiences there."
89210,21873075,2014-10-26,19644965,Matt,"My fiance and I were going to a wedding in Pebble Beach and used this trip as a mini vacation and arrived a couple days before.  This was the PERFECT place for us to stay to for a little rest and relaxation.  The view is wonderful, the garden is beautiful, and Sarah was so welcoming.  Everything was perfect and we could not have asked for anything else!    "
89210,22020812,2014-10-28,11069087,Debbie,"
This was the PERFECT place for us to stay. Beautiful, cozy and in a great neighborhood- close to great restaurants, hikes, and fun things to do. Sarah was warm and welcoming, giving us all kinds of suggestions(and very graciously let us do a load of wash before we took off for the rest of our trip).  The space is SO comfortable and beautiful, and big enough to spread out a bit.  What could be nicer than to wake up in the morning and look out at the ocean from your bed?  We can not recommend this wonderful place enough.  It was a gift for us and I hope we'll have the opportunity to return. "
89210,22157436,2014-10-31,21374699,Chrissy,"A charming and magical place!  Comfortable, clean, and close to town.  Sarah & Evan are helpful and kind hosts with great suggestions (Point Lobos for hiking, First Awakenings for breakfast).  We couldn't have had a better first airbnb experience!  And that Zeus is the sweetest dog in all of California. Great stay!"
89210,22210109,2014-11-01,3389595,Dimitri,"Sarah and Evan were great hosts. They made us feel welcome, and had great advice on restaurants nearby. The view from their garden and guest house is awesome."
89210,22395674,2014-11-05,20166508,Martin,"California Dreamin’ was easy to locate in Pacific Grove. We were greeted by our host Evan; he gave us some of the best recommendations for the area. I believe that we enjoyed every one of his suggestions from places to see on our Big Sur drive to places to eat along the way. The free tickets for the Monterey Aquarium are a marvelous bonus and well worth taking advantage of. The small apartment was self contained and quite comfortable with a great view of the ocean in the distance beyond the lovely garden. The bed was very comfortable and we also enjoyed playing some old records on the record player. The kitchen area was quite basic and the bathroom was well designed, light and airy with a lovely skylight. The whole place had a peaceful Asia feel to it. This was our first ever experience of an Air BnB and we loved our stay at California Dreamin’."
89210,22471760,2014-11-07,23076182,Justin,"Our stay here was like home away from home, but 10x better thanks to our lovely surrounding with an ocean view, the refreshing open air shower, and our delightful and welcoming hosts. They also gave us great recommendations on places to eat and passes to the nearby aquarium. We really enjoyed being able to walk out of the bedroom right into a beautiful garden. Definitely would enjoy staying here again. Thanks so much!"
89210,22540472,2014-11-09,22589124,Pamela,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the bungalow. Evan and Sarah accommodated our late arrival on Friday. We woke up to a beautiful view of the treetops and ocean the next morning. The bungalow itself is newer and nicely decorated. The bed is very comfortable. Everything was sparkling clean. Evan steered us to Holly's Lighthouse Cafe for a great breakfast on Sunday morning. I would stay here again!
89210,22672055,2014-11-11,7217058,Eugene,"Evan was a great host, offering suggestions and lending us some trail books which were super helpful.  The space itself is incredibly quiet and idyllic, and their dog Zeus is very friendly. The record player and aquarium passes are a nice touch. Overall, a great place to stay if you're exploring Big Sur and the Monterey area. "
89210,22741162,2014-11-13,20293793,Betty,"My friend and I had a wonderful relaxing stay with Sarah , Evan and Zeus.  We felt very comfortable and welcome in their cozy studio.  It was especially nice for us to be able to find a home which welcomed our canine kids too !"
89210,22809334,2014-11-15,23312955,Kathleen,"Thank you Sarah and Evan (and sweet Zeus) for your wonderful hospitality and openness! You were helpful on every turn and provided us with a great suggestion for a Fido friendly restaurant suggestion. Toasties was delish. Your place was just as you describe. Lovely view of the ocean, and bonus of a super comfortable bed. "
89210,23153777,2014-11-24,8664178,Mark,"With its blend of Japanese Zen and California casual, Evan and Sarah's bungalow is completely in tune with the beauty and peace of Pacific Grove and the Monterey Peninsula. The bed is spacious and comfortable, and the skylight over the shower is a charming touch. Evan and Sarah made us feel at home immediately on arrival, with helpful suggestions for what to see and where to eat. Don't forget to use the two aquarium passes; you'll be glad you did. "
89210,23366386,2014-11-30,6662321,Kenya,"We stayed at the house , including the bungalow with my extended family of 9 total. It was the perfect size for all of us. The place is cozy with a great view to the ocean. You can tell they are environmentally friendly, and it's expressed in their house. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Sarah and Evan in person. However, they ensured through phone calls, emails , and texts that we felt welcomed and guided.  They answered all of our questions. 
The location is perfect. We visited Carmel, Monterrey, Santa Cruz and Pacific Grove from their location. The aquarium passes were a plus as well. We took turns (2 by 2) to visit it. 
Overall, we had a great time! "
89210,23532153,2014-12-03,51392,Susan,"Even though it rained almost the entire time I was there (yea for California!- if not for me), I had a wonderful time staying in Sarah and Evan's bungalow. Not only was the room itself lovely and calming, there is a beautiful view of the ocean and a fantastic garden they've obviously given lot of time and effort to developing. And the shower is a treat with some of the best smelling products I've ever used! I didn't see a lot of Evan (though he was very welcoming), but I had a few long chats with Sarah who is very generous with her time and has many suggestions for seeing the area. I went down to Big Sur, up to the Aquarium and many places in between. And Zeus is a wonderful addition to their family - my dog Katie fell in love when she was there! All in all, a great experience."
89210,23626479,2014-12-07,9408496,Emilie,"Sarah and Evan were the perfect hosts. Incredibly friendly and helpful, they made us feel right at home. Their bungalow is just ideal. Super comfy bed, dream-like (Website hidden by Airbnb) made our weekend perfect. The Aquarium passes were a wonderful touch, and we definitely took advantage of them! Would definitely recommend this place. "
89210,23831321,2014-12-11,24498021,Christi,"Sarah and Evan are very warm people!  My boyfriend and I stayed at their beautiful home for one night.  The room is very accurate to all of the pictures posted on airbnb,  It even looks better in person!  I love the quiet neighborhood as well.  The location is very close to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.   The room also comes with 2 free day passes.  We would definitely stay there again!  

Thank you, Sarah and Evan!! "
89210,23887415,2014-12-13,10645107,Grace & Zac,"What a wonderful and dream-like stay that we had at Evan and Sarah's place! The Japanese-Chinese inspired room is clean, comfortable and tastefully-decorated; the garden is gorgeous and impressively maintained -- the entire house is so beautiful that you don't even realize that the ocean is right in front of you! 

Evan very generously offered us two tickets to the Aquarium of the Bay, which I would say is now my new favorite aquarium. The exhibitions are incredible and the entire space felt very professional, but also intimate. We only had an hour to see everything before it closed, but even with such short time, it was totally worth it. Please don't miss the chance to visit it -- see the jellyfishes, the tentacles and the sea otters! 

My parents and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We LOVED chatting with Evan and spending time with Zeus. Evan gave us great recommendations of things to do and eat in the area; he also offered us excellent advice on driving on Highway 1. It was such a shame not having the opportunity to meet Sarah; but I am 120% certain that it will not be long till we return to this CA dream! "
89210,24177450,2014-12-22,14860738,Azita,"Sarah and Evan are the epitome of great hosts! My husband and I had the most wonderful experience staying at Sarah and Evan's beautiful home. The bungaloo is exactly as described - immaculately clean, wonderful location, with lovely and thoughtful decor. Music lovers are also in for a treat with a selection of classic vinyl. It would be remiss of me not to mention that this worldly couple are also generous with their time and an absolute delight to talk to! All in all, a five star experience!"
89210,24247699,2014-12-23,2389049,Marleen,"We enjoyed staying at Evan's place. It is not an entire home/apt but  a bedroom and (nice) bathroom connected to the main house and another bedroom in their house (and thus sharing bathroom and kitchen), but that was ok with us, we were only there for 1 night. Evan was very kind in offering the washing machine and dryer, we had lots of dirty laundry from traveling. Maybe thanks!"
89210,24282734,2014-12-24,9259650,Nick,"Sarah and Evan are really nice and very welcoming. The guest cottage is separate, but be aware that if you are more than three people, entire home means that you share their house with them."
89210,24314424,2014-12-25,3675910,Keith,"Very easy and smooth experience.  Sarah and Evan were nice enough to let my family rent the bungalow even though they were visiting family.  The bungalow itself was very clean and comfortable.  My parents and I enjoyed listening to the record collection and looking through the hiking books for ideas for a xmas hike in Big Sur.  All in all, a great time in Monterrey.  Thanks Sarah and Evan!"
89210,24550333,2014-12-30,5539810,Yicheng,"The house is located beside the sea and has a wonderful view. I really really love the design of the house! Although we just stayed for one night, Sarah and Evan accommodated us warmly and helped us plan our trip. Great place to enjoy the beautiful scenes in Monterey!"
89210,24616675,2014-12-31,20122522,Krystal,The house was just as promised - very homey and welcoming in a great location. We rented both the house and the bungalow for a family get together and it was perfect. The beach and 17 mile drive are very close by and a must visit when you are in the neighborhood. Great house and great location!
89210,24844055,2015-01-03,2600513,Scott,"Absolutely wonderful stay in pacific grove. Sarah and Evan were kind, welcoming, and had lots of great local recommendations. They even loaned us dog shampoo and extra towels when we gave our puppy a bath! The studio was well-stocked, the bed was comfortable, and the location was convenient. Would absolutely stay here again."
89210,25092303,2015-01-06,4375486,Caroline,"The bungalow is very nice little studio. The place is very clean and has a great bathroom. The location is ideal to visit Carmel, Monterrey, Pacific Grove or to drive along highway 1. Thanks again Sarah and Evan for having us stay at your place. My parents and I enjoyed our stay a lot!"
89210,25303624,2015-01-11,24325683,Chris,"Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts! Very accommodating, friendly, and attentive! I had the night booked with another host who had to cancel last minute for a very understandable reason last minute. Luckily Sarah and Evans bungalow was available and they responded very very quickly. The bungalow is beautiful with one of the best views I've seen. I will definitely be coming back!"
89210,25359196,2015-01-13,4555485,Susan,"My husband and I so enjoyed our stay in this charming studio overlooking a private garden and ocean view in the distance. The hosts have really created a quiet sanctuary in the hills of Pacific Grove. We knew our visit to the Monterey Peninsula would be too brief so Evin's tips on where to hike and eat pointed us in the right direction, right away. The guest passes to the Monterey Aquarium were a bonus we didn't expect to use but we're so glad we did. We're bound to come back to this area and, when we do, we hope to stay at CA Dreamin' again."
89210,25402831,2015-01-14,18657072,Megan,"Sarah and Evan were fantastic! This was truly one of the best stays we have had. The view was wonderful. What a beautiful way to wake up, looking out over their garden and seeing the ocean right from the bed. They were so accommodating, friendly, and helpful with local recommendations. Would highly recommend their space and their hospitality to others. Thanks again!"
89210,25493802,2015-01-18,3107161,Jeffrey,"We had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Sarah and Evan's bungalow.  Gorgeous ocean views and garden patio, the bed lived up to its high ratings, and we loved the modern bathroom (skylight in shower is a real joy!).  While available to answer any of our questions and respond to any needs, Sarah and Evan also respected our desire for privacy.  Quiet neighborhood location with ready access to Asilomar beach, grocery stores, and all the coastal hiking you could desire.  Also very clean and well-maintained! Can't wait to return!!  "
89210,25723727,2015-01-24,7404011,Mary Ann,"This is a lovely place to stay on the Monterey Peninsula - it's close to the beaches and all the shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove and Monterey. The beautifully decorated room, which is completely stocked with teas, coffee, sugar, honey and half and half, opens on to a wonderful patio with ocean views.
Sarah and Evan are wonderful hosts who made us feel we were staying with friends. We'd happily come back again and hopefully soon. "
89210,25951032,2015-01-31,3543042,Teri,"Sarah and Evan were fabulous hosts, very friendly & accommodating.  The room was aesthetically pleasing, the bed super-comfortable and shower with an opening skylight awesome.  We loved sitting on the patio in their beautiful garden with a view of the ocean.  "
89210,26016008,2015-02-01,18764145,Josh,"Sarah was very pleasant and super helpful. The room was absolutely beautiful, and the bathroom was fantastic. We had a wonderful stay!"
89210,26121523,2015-02-03,5383530,Cyrus,"Pictures very accurate. Warm, receptive, responsive hosts. Luxurious bed and so much attention to details of the bungalow. Thank you Sarah, Evan, Zeus and family. Go Bears! "
89210,26183202,2015-02-06,24614549,Rachel,"My friend and I loved staying in the bungalow at Sarah and Evan's home. My dog loved staying there too! The house has an incredibly beautiful garden, a view of the ocean and the bungalow itself is cozy and beautiful. We especially enjoyed listening to the record collection after spending a day hiking in Big Sur. Sarah and Evan are excellent hosts: kind, welcoming, full of suggestions for day trips! I hope I can stay there again soon!"
89210,26695373,2015-02-17,26322139,Joanne,Fantastic place! Amazing view and a super hospitable host! will definitely come back here again!
89210,26741814,2015-02-18,10807790,Jessica,"Oh my goodness! Can't say enough about our experience! The bathroom is envy inducing! Even their dog and the neighbors are welcoming! Such a gracious host family! The area is stunning.  We had an amazing, affordable, authentic dinner at a place called Sea Harvest that Sarah recommended. We only stayed one night, but there is plenty to do in the area.  We would love to go back and would definitely stay with Sarah and her family again.  "
89210,26789878,2015-02-19,18356329,Nichole,"Sarah and Evan's place was great! We only got to meet Sarah because Evan was sick, but Sarah was very welcoming. She gave us great suggestions for what to do around the area. The place was very clean, and it was the perfect size for a couple. I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Monterey!"
89210,26829409,2015-02-20,281140,Patty,"Highly recommended! The place is very cozy with sea view, and Sarah  and Evan are extremely helpful, providing travel tips and even checking the weather for us. I would highly recommend this to everyone. "
89210,26929555,2015-02-22,10172884,Megan,"We stayed in Sarah & Evan's bungalow for a weekend getaway trip and it was absolutely lovely. Sarah did a great job communicating with us to make sure we were taken care of. The bungalow is located around the back of their home, and it is very clean and they thought of all the perfect touches. It was a great location to go out and explore Big Sur, Monterey, Carmel-by-the-Sea, and more. We had a fantastic time and are already thinking of coming back soon!"
89210,27140049,2015-02-26,18808345,Jessica,"Sarah and Evan are amazing hosts.  From the very beginning of our communications through the entire stay they made us feel welcome and answered all of our questions.  Both Sarah and Evan were unfortunately under the weather when we visited, but despite all that Sarah took an extraordinary amount of time to explain to us points of interest in the neighborhood, where to eat given our preferences, and even EXACTLY where to park when visiting the Monterey Bay aquarium, all of which was immensely helpful.  

Their dog Zeus is also a joy.  He hung out with us the apartment every once in a while, very much tolerant of, if not confused by, our pup who has the gift of sight!

The neighborhood is extremely quiet so you'll not have any issues with noise.  It is on a hill a bit away from downtown so I would personally recommend a car so you can get around to Pacific Grove/Carmel/Monterey with ease.  

One of the highlights was the off leash dog beach that Sarah told us about- we headed down there with our dog for the sunset and at the end ran into Zeus, Sarah, and her two children.  It was fun to see that we had similar interests and this made us feel even more at home.

In all, we would greatly recommend this place to anyone that's looking for a place to stay in the area.  Between the hospitality, the quality of the room, and the record player (!), we had a real blast.

Thank you again Sarah and Evan for hosting us - we hope to come back and visit again for a longer stay!"
89210,27260872,2015-03-01,21183684,Colleen,"Our very rain soaked, wet, weekend was awesome! The views are amazing. The room is very clean and well appointed. If I could've figured out a way to take the bed with me, I might have tried (yes, THAT comfy). Evan was awesome suggesting and mapping out places to go and avoid. Zeus was/is adorable. 

We cannot wait to return with better weather and sit outside enjoying the view with some good wine/ conversation with both Sarah and Evan. "
89210,27353587,2015-03-02,9899024,Steve,Cozy oriental experience with a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean. We should have stayed longer than overnight. Definitely recommend this place to friends and family. 
89210,27537100,2015-03-07,15787407,Brittany,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! The location was great, the place was clean, and they were very welcoming (Zeus was so cute!). Their recommendations for food, when to go to the aquarium, and hiking were all very helpful and made our experience even better.  The bed and bathroom are super nice and I would definitely visit again.    "
89210,27582490,2015-03-08,11106171,Ted,"Our stay was okay. The room was clean and ready for us. We were however surprised that the ""bungalow"" was not free standing but a room on the house, albeit with a separate entrance via a patio door. The garden/patio immediately in front of the door is nice but would have been a real intrusion on privacy if the renters of the main building would have made use of it."
89210,27718545,2015-03-10,18921651,Jeannette,"Sarah and Evan are great hosts. Very friendly, communicative and helpful with local recommendations. The bungalow has great views and is located in a quiet neighborhood. 
We especially loved the shower with the sky light, the record player and Zeus, the charming little dog. "
89210,27789391,2015-03-11,4770459,Chad,Nice remodled modern in - law suite with perks like a record player and aquarium passes. Sarah and Evan are friendly gracious hosts. Thank you both :)
89210,27835382,2015-03-13,19478408,Julia,"Sarah and Evan's lovely compact space was the perfect spot from which to explore the environs.  It had everything we needed with the extra benefit of a beautiful garden and far away ocean view.  Quiet, convenient and in a nice neighborhood CA Dreaming felt like a little slice of heaven.  And yes, it has a great bed and shower!  For any real cooking purposes you will need to use their kitchen which is also a very pleasant light filled space.
Both hosts were extremely helpful (giving excellent tips)  and friendly.
I would definitely return."
89210,27903108,2015-03-14,21746967,Stephen,"Sarah and Evan are wonderful, and we had a perfect night. The room looks exactly like the pictures. We had every bit of privacy we could ask for. Sarah and Evan are extremely knowledgeable of the area and very helpful on where to dine. 

Zeus is friendly, loving, and adorable. We hope to have the pleasure of returning for a longer stay in the near future. Everything positive in previous reviews are true. Thank you Sarah and Evan for opening your bungalow to us and making our getaway perfect."
89210,27924462,2015-03-15,15469906,Shaayak,"Sarah and Evan were amazing hosts with a very beautiful home - we'd love to visit again. Lots of good tips for food, scenic spots, and hiking trails - and we stayed very comfortably as a group of 5. Thanks for a great trip!"
89210,28069578,2015-03-17,24907534,Liz,"We were a group of 8 so we stayed in both Sarah and Evan's home and the bungalow. Both spaces are small and cozy, but all eight of us had beds to sleep in. We had to fight over who got the bungalow, though! It was the perfect place to come home to after long days of hiking in Big Sur. They are very close to a Safeway with a Starbucks which we enjoyed running out to as well as the Monastery Beach. I think some of my friends were bummed they didn't have a TV but it was so nice to sit at the patio and watch the sunset instead. We didn't meet Sarah and Evan but Sarah was sure to call me ahead of time and sort out all the details. The wifi is also a big plus! Would definitely recommend! "
89210,28479070,2015-03-24,2548481,Angela & Colin,"Had a great time! The space was welcoming, clean and what we expected. Both Sarah and Evan provided excellent recommendations. They were available if you needed them but also provided privacy. "
89210,28716082,2015-03-29,27741732,Beth,"Our weekend stay at Sarah and Evan's home (bungalow suite) surpassed my expectations. The instructions for arrival were spot on, and both Sarah and Evan were so warm and welcoming. Sarah & Evan were welcoming to our dog Timmy, and made us feel comfortable leaving him for a couple of hours to explore. Zeus was a ball of fuzz, so adorable! 

The bungalow itself exemplified their care; it was a calm and serene escape. We played records, enjoyed the amazing shower with sky light, and yes, the bed is as comfortable as everyone says! And, their garden! Oh the garden was a work of art; we enjoyed playing cards on the picnic table, listening the sounds of the ocean, and just taking in the quietness of the experience. 

Thank you all for such a wonderful weekend, it truly was the perfect birthday escape. I hope to be back soon!  "
89210,29092244,2015-04-04,25442138,Brandon,Sara and Evan were excellent host and made us feel right at home. We were greeted with smiles and a wonderful knowledge of the area. The room was clean and as described. We'll be back for future visits to this beautiful part of California!
89210,29161905,2015-04-05,25973799,Clare,"We had a wonderful stay at Sarah and Evans accommodation - the bed was super comfy, we loved the decor and it was in such a peaceful location with views of the sunset. Sarah and Evan were really helpful and easy to communicate with. We wouldn't hesitate in recommending to other guests, we will definitely be back!"
89210,29494381,2015-04-08,21464969,Mindy,"This was a great Airbnb experience! Great location, clean, very large comfortable bed, and very friendly hosts. The pictures are very accurate and the view of the ocean was beautiful. We would love to come back sometime. "
89210,29816405,2015-04-13,18531123,Marion,Sarah and Evan are absolutely adorable. They welcomed me in the kindest way and made me feel very special. The studio is located at the back of their garden with a wide glass window facing the ocean. STUNNING VIEW! The neighbourhood is quiet and you are a short distance from the beach. PARADISE ON EARTH!
89210,29920127,2015-04-14,6044835,Dan,"We had a wonderful stay with Evan and Sarah, the cottage is a beautiful place to relax with great views of the ocean. We would definitely recommend staying here! "
89210,29977590,2015-04-15,23511156,Margaret,"Upon arrival, we are greeted by Zeus (who is super adorable) and Evan. Evan is a wonderful host and really easy going. He showed us around the place. Everything about their home and the room was beautiful. The room is very clean and comfortable. You're able to see the ocean from the bed. I fell asleep easily during the day and again at night. The location is perfect because they are near the aquarium. The bonus about staying here is that they let you borrow aquarium membership passes! 

Thank you again Sarah and Evan. Thank you for finding my charger. Will try to visit again soon! "
89210,30434065,2015-04-21,25587726,Ali,"evan was a great host in making us feel comfortable and giving us the perfect tips on what to do during our 2 day getaway from the bay. the place is a dream and you wont be disappointed at all!
the bed is extremely comfortable and the shower is just as dreamy as in the pics."
89210,30543483,2015-04-24,25914554,Alexandra,"Although brief, our stay at CA Dreaming was extremely relaxing. The room was exactly as described - loved the comfortable bed and open air shower! The neighborhood was very peaceful, and I wished we had had better weather to better enjoy the outdoor patio and view. Sarah and Evan were welcoming and gave us some great restaurant and sightseeing suggestions."
89210,31150637,2015-05-02,5266836,Roya & Andrew,"Sarah and Evan's place was a great escape for us! Very peaceful and serene, where you immediately feel comfortable in their beautiful garden. It checked all the boxes on cleanliness, coziness and location. We loved our stay and would highly recommend our hosts. "
89210,31626253,2015-05-08,24587817,Benjamin,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The accommodations were as presented on Air BnB.  A lovely private bungalow with a super comfortable bed and big bathroom (loved the skylight in the shower!).  The whole place was immaculate and well appointed.  The view of Monterey Bay from the bed is great to wake up to and to watch with a glass of good wine in hand in the evening!

Sarah and Evan are great hosts.  Besides being generous with their whole home, they provided lots of good information on the whole Central Coast.

As owners of two dogs, we were suckers for their sweet pup Zeus--nothing better than being greeted with ferocious barking that was all just a pretense for serious affection.

Will try to stay here next time we are in the area!"
89210,31763493,2015-05-10,26113219,Susan,"The studio is exactly as described, clean and very comfortable.  The location is wonderful, and we had a fantastic weekend.  Thanks!"
89210,32171713,2015-05-15,1089668,Robin,"Sara and Evan were very welcoming - and the place was exactly as described.  A lovely zen get away in Pacific Grove - with a view of the ocean and a modern cozy apartment that looked out on the garden.
Sara and Zeus (their dog) were gracious hosts and provided lots of information about things to do - from dog friendly beaches at Asilomar to vegetarian restaurants and coffee houses.  I enjoyed sitting out in the succulent garden and watching the sun rise, and walks at the beach...and the free ticket to the aquarium was a lovely surprise (great tentacles exhibit!).  I loved the shower - how clever a design!"
89210,32674942,2015-05-20,9390904,Lindsay,We had a marvelous marvelous time staying in the cottage for 5 days. Ocean breeze and ocean view from your bed.....the entire place was peaceful and full of interesting art and furniture and music. Evan and Sarah were lovely hosts with great energy. 
89210,32782560,2015-05-21,27512317,Adam,"Sarah (along with her dog Zeus) met us with a friendly smile and was very accommodating with our late check in.  Communication was tip top.
The accommodation was quite beautiful, with a super comfortable bed.
There is a great view of the ocean just past the gorgeous succulent garden right outside the room.
It was great waking up to that view as well as listening to a Bob Marley vinyl on the record player.
The passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium was great plus.
It was a short quick stay, but we will be back!"
89210,33220758,2015-05-26,875557,David,"We enjoyed a very comfortable and relaxing 6 night stay at Sarah and Evan's CA Dreaming bungalow. Location was in a quiet, cul-de-sac, neighborhood with friendly neighbors and was very convenient to local sites, activities, restaurants and grocery stores. The bungalow was roomy for the two of us and the king size bed was nice, as well as, the spacious bathroom. The dorm room fridge, microwave, coffee maker, dishes and utensils allowed us to prepare a few breakfasts and lunches in the bungalow. Sarah and Evan's local restaurant recommendations were right on.....ate at the Passionfish twice! Lovely patio/garden and small but nice ocean view. Great communication and instructions before our arrival.  This was our first experience with Airbnb and we both agreed it won't be our last"
89210,33500745,2015-05-29,29286611,Rita,"Stay with Sarah if you're in PG! Sarah is a sweet, warm host who really attends to her guests' interests and needs. Her garden is beautiful just like the rest of PG. The bungalow is not too big but the ornaments and furniture will take your breath away. You will probably have a spiritual awakening when you meet Zeus, the dog. Thank Sarah for making my parents and my stay so pleasant!"
89210,33775258,2015-06-01,3462626,Troy,"My wife and I stayed here during our wedding, and I couldn't have imagined staying anywhere else.The pictures of this property are great, but the experience was even better than we could've hoped for. The neighborhood was quiet and quaint, the view was spectacular, and we slept like babies on the incredibly comfortable bed. Our hosts (Sarah & Evan) really made the trip special. Their warmth and hospitality were evident from arrival to departure. They genuinely enjoy being hosts and bend over backwards to ensure that you maximize your time in Pacific Grove. Their recommendations for dining and sightseeing are better than anything you'll find on Yelp or a travel guide. If you're interested in doing any hiking in Big Sur or the surrounding area, then I highly recommend speaking to Evan. He is a highly advanced hiker/backpacker who has hiked every trail around these parts and will point you in the right direction for your skill level. 5 Stars!"
89210,34009627,2015-06-03,6201894,Kenneth,"Staying at Sarah and Evan's bungalow in Pacific Grove was a completely magical experience. The room overlooks Monterey Bay, letting the natural sunlight wake me up in the morning started my day off perfect. As per Sarah's request, I visited the Aquarium and hiked at Point Lobos. Both completely blew me away. The next day I took a surf lesson in Carmel and had a blast.
Sarah and Evan could not have been more welcoming and hospitable. They were always making me feel right at home and were such a pleasure to interact with. The record collection in the bungalow took the experience over the top! It was so relaxing to come back to the room to take a shower and unwind with a record on the turntable. I can't recommend this place enough!"
89210,34124300,2015-06-05,27065010,Karl,"Sarah and Evan did a great job of making us feel welcome. The bungalow was perfect and was set up with everything that we needed, and Sarah was there to walk us through anything we might need to know and answer any questions we had. They had a ton of recommendations for us for food and activities, and had even printed a large number of these out in case we needed a suggestion and they weren't around. They definitely went out of their way to make our stay as perfect as possible, Sarah even lent my wife her shoes so we could go for a hike! The neighborhood was wonderful and we had lots of fun driving in and around Pacific Grove. "
89210,34537475,2015-06-09,27539388,Carol,"  Sarah and Evan are absolutely wonderful, as is their environment.  Highly recommend!"
89210,34692704,2015-06-11,5336971,Cynthia,"We had a wonderful phone conversation before our arrival and we felt so welcome to arrive at any time and all would be ready for us and it was! Sarah is a warm and welcoming host! We arrived just in time for a gorgeous sunset over the bay which you can actually see from the bed! Super comfortable bed. Best sleep ever! Fun shower! Loved the Japanese decor and the record selection. Loved having morning coffee on the private patio and the changing light on the bay. Zeus dog was a delight. Sarah helped us with travel directions, restairant selections and sights to see. After a busy day be sure to get back to the cottage in time to just relax on the garden patio. A PATCH OF PEACE!
"
89210,34846604,2015-06-13,7746612,Ann,"We had a wonderful experience at Sarah and Evan's place. It is as lovely as the pictures show. Very peaceful, restful. They are very friendly but will respect your privacy as well. Neighborhood and location great. Zeus the three-legged dog was a bonus, as well as their very fun record collection. Garden is beautiful as well."
89210,35064947,2015-06-15,27075152,Sang,What a beautiful house! We stayed here for 2 days very comfortably. Very clean room. Sarah and Evan were very kind. I would visit this place again!
89210,35251338,2015-06-16,10083934,Wilbur,"This bungalow is a fantastic place to stay! The shower is very modern and gorgeous with a sun window. It felt like the perfect urban getaway. The place is extremely clean and tidy, and it's only 8min drive from the Monterey Aquarium (The sharks, otters, jellyfish, penguins are a must see!)

Thank you Sarah and Evan!"
89210,35536847,2015-06-20,26272730,Terra,Our stay with Sarah and Evan was great! The bungalow was just right for the two of us staying and touring around Monterey. Their recommendations for places to eat and things to do were perfect and we had a lot of fun. The record player was super fun too!
89210,35746559,2015-06-21,35911206,Matt,"My stay was perfect! Room was great, bed was very comfortable and the view was amazing. Sarah was very helpful and accommodating.  Would highly recommend to friends and family  "
89210,35919801,2015-06-23,29892567,Amy,"Sarah and Evan were excellent hosts!  We made a mistake in booking in our end, and Sarah/Evan were very gracious about it.  They have information for local attractions and services compiled, and gave us a quick tour in order to explain the set-up in person, which was very helpful."
89210,36081814,2015-06-25,25854116,Lucy,Great stay in Pacific Grove. Went too fast! sarah was very helpful with lots of local suggestions. Accom as described-very comfy bed!! 
89210,36204496,2015-06-26,16387403,Marti,"We had a wonderful stay at CA Dreaming!  Sarah and Evan were very easy to communicate with and went above and beyond to coordinate the use of the aquarium passes to fit in with our schedule. The space itself was very welcoming- clean, cosy,  comfortable, and very tastefully decorated.  Our favorites were the amazing shower with an opened skylight and the relaxing outdoor garden space.  Pacific Grove is a cute town, and we wish we had had more time to spend there. "
89210,36366848,2015-06-28,24813580,Ritchie,"Sarah and Evan are great hosts, we had a very enjoyable stay. They gave really helpful and friendly advice on what to do in and around the area - as well great food recommendations for someone with a difficult diet! The bungalow was as described, clean and comfortable. The record player and vinyls are a great touch and there was an album for any mood. Communication with Sarah and Evan throughout was great, they were very quick at responding. We highly recommend staying here."
89210,36654817,2015-06-30,22059861,Mohini,Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts and their home was totally delightful! The kids loved Zeus too! The bed is soooo comfortable. I had the best nights sleep there. The view from the garden to the sea is beautiful. Close by was a fantastic beach (Asilomar) where you could watch amazing sunsets. The house is very well situated to do the 17 mile drive and close to Monterey's Aquarium. We had a wonderful stay there and wished we had booked to stay longer. If you come I would really recommend Hollys' in Pacific Grove for breakfast. We also took Sarah's advice and stopped at Phil's (Moss Landing) on the way down from San Francisco. The food was worth the queue!  
89210,37035763,2015-07-04,5019573,Tiffany (Tiff),"Thanks so much to Sarah and Evan for providing such a cute, quaint bungalow for our Thelma and Louise trip! The view was amazing, the garden spectacular and great recommendations! "
89210,37302957,2015-07-06,3660701,Devinder,Great place - everything was as described and well maintained. Would definitely stay there again. 
89210,37639051,2015-07-09,28711895,Katy,"We had such a lovely time staying in the bungalow! Not only was it comfortable and quaint, we loved all of the little details. The vinyl record player, the beautiful views, and gorgeous landscaping just to say a few..... We'll highly recommend it!"
89210,37786249,2015-07-10,9294139,Abby,Sahra and Even's place is such an adorable & beautiful place. The location is perfect and there's nothing better than sipping wine and watching the sunset sitting on the patio. The record collection..glorious!
89210,37959353,2015-07-12,30809730,Helen,"We enjoyed our stay! Though we weren't able to meet our hosts, we feel welcomed by the clean and neat bungalow awaiting. The view from the yard is just spectacular and the amenities in the bungalow are sufficient. 
My husband loves the turntable by the way! Enjoyed the quietness and the wonderful music! "
89210,38265682,2015-07-14,4810737,Karyn,"This is a wonderful guest house rental.  Sarah and Evan provide incredibly useful, complete information to experience of Pacific Grove and Monteray.  The guest house itself is as described with wonderful details - the record collection, the shower, the gardens, and a big lovely bed with extraordinary views.  All and all a wonderful experience.  "
89210,38459531,2015-07-15,31627668,Gregory,"The bungalow was very confortable and we truly enjoyed staying at this place even we stayed only one night. Safe, clean, quiet neighborhood."
89210,38603707,2015-07-17,23897091,Connie,We knew we were somewhere special as soon as we walked into the yard around the bungalow. The gardens are beautiful and the view from it is outstanding. The bungalow is cozy and relaxing. There were plenty of little spots to read or have coffee and the beach and shops are a quick ~5 minute drive with plentiful parking.
89210,39000901,2015-07-20,32330036,Antoine,"Thanks a lot Sarah and Evan,
It's been a pleasure to be hosted in your lovely place. The view is just awesome. Thanks a lot also for the member pass for the aquarium. We are found of fish and sealife so  It was a great pleasure for us to go and visit.
Unfortunately We had not meet you but i am sure in regards to your musical tracks We have talks to share.
Please feel free to give a call if you come to Paris, it Will be a pleasure to make You discover the town and give you good infos.

Regards 
Antoine & Vanina "
89210,39265424,2015-07-22,29109859,Cherilyn,Tranquil and peaceful hideaway!  Close to town but feels very far away from the madding crowd.  The bed was super fabulous!!
89210,39913824,2015-07-27,30866913,Adam,"Sarah & Evan were helpful and enthusiastic hosts.  They communicated clearly to answer all questions.  The ""bungalow"" was clean and comfortable with a nice view from the patio.  We enjoyed the quiet residential setting.  The descriptions were very accurate.
"
89210,40690642,2015-08-01,29664938,Chen,"We had good time. We stayed only one night at Sarah's place. She is very nice. My daughter loves the way the place decorated, especially the bathroom, and the record player. We enjoyed the aquarium too.
Thank Sarah for hosting us."
89210,40855834,2015-08-02,2640803,Elise,"Evan and Sarah were wonderful hosts! Very gracious, interesting and personable couple.

The bungalow was perfect for a getaway. Quiet, clean and comfortable. We especially enjoyed the shower...

and Zeus, their 3 legged blind dog was such a darling :) "
89210,41086704,2015-08-04,13440736,Rebecca,"sarah and evan couldn't have been kinder and more welcoming.  they even gave us a bottle of wine to commemorate our wedding (we stayed at their place as part of our honeymoon road trip ).  the space is even cuter than the photos show - they've added little touches including a cafe table and new pillows, and the succulent garden is beautiful.  the record collection is awesome.  and sarah designed the best excursions for us - aquarium in the morning, followed by hiking and then dinner and drinks at nepenthe's in big sur.  i would stay here again in a heartbeat.  also, their little dog was very mellow and welcoming too : )"
89210,41328743,2015-08-07,28302720,Nathalie,"We stayed in this bungalow 2 nights.
The decoration was nice and zen with a wonderful view. The bed was huge and good. And the shower was also really nice. 
We didn't see Sarah and Evan, however they support us via message text for any question."
89210,41402853,2015-08-07,37245082,Lawrence,The bungalow was comfortable and in a great quiet neighborhood. Our host Sarah was terrific. A great base from which to explore the area.
89210,41951509,2015-08-10,28941223,Tamsin,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time at Sarah and Evan's beautiful house in Pacific Grove. The room was even more spectacular in person & their recommendations were what really made our short stay there special. We felt welcomed and at home and are planning on returning in the near future :)!
89210,43408766,2015-08-19,14451780,Ashley,"We absolutely loved our stay. The room was incredibly clean and very comfortable and Sara and Evan were so kind and welcoming. We actually ended up staying in the room more than the town because it was so nice and relaxing. They even had shower and bathroom supplies in case you forgot yours.  The house is conveniently located close to shopping and the aquarium, which was fabulous. Thanks so much for having us!"
89210,43635124,2015-08-21,37194554,Alan,"Sarah and Evan were wonderful hosts. Very warm folk, and gave us lots of information on what to do in the Pacific Grove/Carmel/Monterey area. The neighborhood was very good and all worked out very well.. Only drawback, we are both Senior citizens, and had a problem with their 
shower.. No grabbars on the wall. Other than that the unit was perfect with a lovely garden just outside the door, and a wonderful little house dog, Zeus, who is blind and has three legs, and is one sweet dog. We had a great time on our small trip, thanks to their efforts."
89210,43810811,2015-08-22,39388963,Joel,Outstanding! We loved the fresh and practical decor. The bed was exceedingly comfortable. The bathroom was great and the unexpected private garden (shared with the house) patio with a glimpse of the Pacific was a delightful place to sit. Every amenity from hair dryer to hiking guide was included. We throughly appreciated the detail and range of restaurant suggestions. Passionfish and Holly's Lighthouse were just what we were looking for. We also enjoyed the apparently new bookstore/cafe next to Passionfish.  Our only disappointment was not meeting the owners. We couldn't rate this location more highly. 
89210,44344263,2015-08-25,40534502,Rachel,"Great place with a lovely view. Good escape from the hotel scene. We stayed for two nights, but probably not good for a longer period as we had concerns about security. The bungalow does not have a proper lock so for international quests like ourselves we found it necessary to carry our travel docs with us always. Also no ability to lock the door from the inside which made me nervous at night - not knowing how safe the area is. Really enjoyed the aquarium so great touch to have two passes included."
89210,44900890,2015-08-30,19765234,Randy,We had a good stay. The bungalow was perfect with a great view of the ocean. Sarah and Evan were very nice and helpful.
89210,45292911,2015-09-01,8517694,Joost,"Laidback room with great surrounding. Cosy bed, nice vinyl collection. Evan was a wonderful host and provided us with some really helpful tips and recommendations. Thanks for your hospitality!"
89210,46112207,2015-09-08,11115171,Beate,This is the second time we stayed at Evan's & Sarah's house.  We left as friends already the first time and now it feels like our second home!!! The only hard thing is leaving again.... Can't wait to return.
89210,46398759,2015-09-10,40802426,Karen,"I had a wonderful stay with Sarah and Evan in Pacific Heights! The room was beautifully decorated, Sarah and Evan were friendly and kind, and their corner of the world is just beautiful. I was on a 10-day trip up the coast, and the 2 days I spent here were by far my favorite!"
89210,47041931,2015-09-15,2432973,Claudio,"Our brief stay at this lovely guest house was amazing!! The view as gorgeous looking out from the bedroom and Sarah was super friendly and helpful.  The room was clean, well stocked, the bathroom and shower were awesome.  The complimentary passes to the aquarium was a bonus and definitely worth going.  Would definitely come back and stay here."
89210,47246339,2015-09-17,17831216,Neil,"This place is a real GEM!!! the view is to die for and the place is cosy, welcoming, roomy and...with a great bed.
Sarah and Evan were absolutely welcoming, guiding us to the must see places in the neighborhood. 
If you'd like to stay in the Monterey Peninsula and love peace, quiet and an amazing view, then stop looking as this is the place!"
89210,47373714,2015-09-18,40996190,Courtney,"Daniel and I truly enjoyed our brief stay at Sarah and Evan's. The view and outdoor space was so peaceful and picaresque. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and the shower with the open air skylight was a such a unique/amazing feature. I definitely want to look into doing that in my own home. The neighborhood was quaint. The hosts left brilliant recommendations for food- went to 3 of their spots and enjoyed them all. The aquarium passes were perfect because not only did we get to skip the entry line- we got a discount at the gift shop too! Sarah was attentive at times when we had questions and upon check in but we were also given space and privacy when we didn't need anything. Overall, wonderful time here!"
89210,48499287,2015-09-27,33374996,Bree,"Flexible and helpful host, super comfy bed, and beautiful view - perfect recipe for a lovely stay in Pacific Grove! "
89210,48912088,2015-09-29,28329922,Danielle,"We had a great stay here! Sarah and Evan were very friendly and welcoming and gave us lots of recommendations and information. We really enjoyed drinking a glass of wine in the outdoor area with a great view of the sunset. 
The Aquarium passes were a bonus and definitely recommend going there! "
89210,50066946,2015-10-09,26986896,Chloe,"We absolutely loved our stay at Sarah and Evan's place! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer! 

Sarah was very welcoming and accommodating, letting us check in early and leave our bags before heading out (we didn't get to meet Evan during our stay). Sarah also gave us some brilliant tips on things to do and places to eat during our short stay in Pacific Grove. 

The room/bungalow was immaculate. The bed was so comfortable and we loved the sky light shower! Oh and not forgetting the amazing views of the ocean from the bedroom and patio area, which was particularly beautiful at sunset! 

The location is great, just a short drive away from the Monterey Bay area and a good base for exploring Big Sur.

We would highly recommend this listing and we certainly hope to visit again some time soon. 

Oh and their dog Zeus was adorable :-) "
89210,50269595,2015-10-11,34788292,Anne,"Very cozy, clean and airy studio. Great view and caused immediate relaxation!"
89210,50756007,2015-10-14,15027334,Roch,"Sarah warmly welcomed us and provided great advice for restaurants and sightseeing, not too mention the best recommendations for hikes to be explore in the beautiful Big Sur area.  Would certainly stay there again and would highly recommend it."
89210,51555224,2015-10-21,39045649,Beth,"Sarah and Evan are excellent hosts: they were friendly and interested in making sure we had all the information we needed to have a great visit.  The bungalow is immaculate and despite the small size (which we wanted), an area to make coffee in, comfortable bed and excellent bathroom with a skylight.  The ocean view, which you can see from the bed, is beautiful and peaceful.  Also there some adirondack chairs in front of the bungalow where I took in some sun and enjoyed the view while my husband was golfing.  We had a lovely stay. "
89210,51636515,2015-10-22,31579015,Kirstin,Sarah and Evan were fantastic and the apartment/bungaloo is just as described - very comfy and the view is beautiful.  The bed is just as great as the other reviews say!!
89210,52047138,2015-10-26,38840455,Katherine,"My husband and I stopped here on our honeymoon road trip adventure down Pacific Coast Highway 1.  WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED staying at this beautiful retreat.  Everything was gorgeous, we loved the view and peaceful succulent garden.  Evan spent a tremendous amount of time with us when we first arrived getting us acclimated to the area and gave us insider tips on where the locals hike, park, and hang out.  (Between the free aquarium passes as well as tips for where we could park for free, we saved well over $100 staying here just with insider info alone.)  There is so much to do in this gorgeous area!  I wish we could've stayed longer!  The suite we stayed in was SO BEAUTIFUL with so much natural lighting, especially in the bathroom, as well as a beautiful view of the ocean and garden.  The bed was super comfortable.  So many aspects of the suite showed how much thoughtfulness and care went into creating it.  Evan and Sarah have truly created a beautiful, peaceful space.  We would absolutely love to come back."
89210,52338351,2015-10-28,45367052,Nicole,"We came for a relaxing ""weekend"" and that's exactly what we got. The bungalow was beautiful, comfortable, and convenient. Sarah was very hospitable and gave great recommendations. This was an all around great experience. "
89210,52458342,2015-10-29,4770459,Chad,"My second time staying in the in-law suite was even more enjoyable than the first. Such a romantic suite with great views, privacy and ambiance. Thanks again Sara and Evan! "
89210,52523128,2015-10-30,7250131,Scott,"We were instantly made to feel at home in this space. The information about the surrounding area was absolutely invaluable. They helped me find a location to propose that left both of us speechless. Also provided passes to the local aquarium that is a must see! Loved our stay here. Would definitely stay there again. 

PS Big ups to their three legged, blind dog Zeus. Sweetest dog ever."
89210,52858928,2015-11-02,43945420,Amy,"We had a fantastic stay in the bungalow. Every last detail of the space was well thought out. The bed is super comfortable (100% sleep quality on my SleepCycle app) and the shower is positively luxurious. We came and went as we pleased, and loved waking up every morning to a view of the bay and the colorful garden full of succulents. Sarah had lots of helpful suggestions for how to spend our free time in the are. The free aquarium passes are a big plus if you plan on visiting. If we come back to the area, we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else."
89210,53182657,2015-11-06,35520436,Joce,"My partner and I, along with our puppies, had such a wonderful stay at Sarah and Evan's place.  The place was very clean and everything is of high quality.  We felt like we were in an expensive suite at one of the Hilton's hotels.  The shower was to die for as it has an open skyline.  Very thoughtful design by Evan and we enjoyed showers with the view of beautiful sky.  We were in love with the place and its location.  Everything we wanted to do, or was recommended to do, was close by and within driving / walking distance.  The view of the ocean was fantastic and the garden was tastefully decorated.  We truly enjoyed our time there and look forward to returning in the very near future.  "
89210,53640306,2015-11-10,33175365,Mami,It was a wonderful stay! 
89210,53745398,2015-11-12,17217216,Robyn,"Loved staying here!  It really felt like staying at a friends house.  The environment is warm and welcoming and we loved every second of our stay here!  Sarah is so sweet and a big thank you for letting us bring our dog :)  By the way, we loved Zeus!!!  Such a funny, sweet, friendly dog!  We hope to be back soon! Thanks again for everything :) "
89210,54043483,2015-11-15,5887758,Thomas,"We greatly enjoyed our stay here in Pacific Grove, and everything was as described. Favorite features were the giant, open shower and the record collection (pretty eclectic, and a nice Woodstock recording set). Our late check in/out was as easy as it gets.  While we unfortunately did not meet our hosts, they were very easily accessible through phone/messenger. We had a minor hang up with a cleaning item, but Sarah and Evan responded immediately and had their housekeeper come within an hour to set it right. Granted, when a cleaning fee is on the board, it is hoped that things will be clean on arrival... but like anything else, sometimes mistakes are made or things overlooked.
As a general AirBnB courtesy (which I suggest to other guests staying anywhere), I always give hosts an opportunity to correct something, because the good ones always will. Furthermore, they look out for it on subsequent visits. So please give your hosts a chance to impress you and make future visits even better. I was pleasantly surprised at their attention, even remotely; this is the hallmark of outstanding hosts."
89210,54317155,2015-11-18,45280003,Jamie,"Sarah and Evan were fantastic hosts. Evan recommended a few really good hikes that my wife and I went on. Also a good place for us to get food. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, Sarah and Evan were super welcoming and accommodating. We travelled with our 9 month old baby and the room was great. We ended up being able to use  the little kitchen as a place for a pack and play for him to sleep. The bed is famous and for a reason, it was very comfortable. The view from the room and deck is over the water, stunning. I would go back tomorrow if we could lol."
89210,54389333,2015-11-19,36915162,Phillip,"Evan's cozy bungalow is in a very nice, quiet and safe neighborhood.  The room is clean.  His information binder is a gem: local favorite eateries and a long list of hiking trails info.   Evan is very responsive to my inquiries, and made sure I could find his place upon evening arrival in the dark.  The location is superb --- a few minutes drive to the coast.  His loyal puppy Zeus is also friendly. "
89210,54451259,2015-11-20,35027447,Nicholas,Best place to stay in Monterey. Wouldn't hesitate to go back again. 
89210,54891054,2015-11-25,266457,Irina,"This was such a lovely space! We loved playing records at night while making some tea, and the shower was a lovely experience in the morning! Great recommendations in the manual too, we actually did a TON of them including 3 recommended hikes in big sur and one in point Lobos, had the best uni of my life at Crystal sushi, watched the sunset at a restaurant off cannery row after the aquarium - it was a really magical time thanks to the lovely manual! "
89210,55718130,2015-12-05,20487590,Alyssa,"Really awesome girls weekend getaway to Monterey, pacific Grove and Big Sur. The guest apartment was well appointed for a small space and they thought of all the essentials. Love the bathroom and the skylight. The bed was great and we had sweet peaceful sleep. Highly recommended!"
89210,55815235,2015-12-06,22178692,Peter,"Our stay at Sarah and Evan's ""California Dreaming"" bungalow was filled with comfort! From the spacious shower to the cool view, we could not have asked for more in a weekend getaway in the Monterey Bay area. 10/10 would recommend!"
89210,56070286,2015-12-08,5554790,Dominic,"Great, clean."
89210,56221749,2015-12-10,50529015,Julia,"Sarah & Evan were great! The home was very comfortable and inviting, and the both of them were very accommodating. Did not get to meet Evan but Sarah was fantastic, not to mention Zeus, their adorable dog. The home is in a great location, trader joes right down the street, a common day luxury for me that I fortunately got to enjoy with my stay. Also needed that glass of wine to enjoy with the view. Just a heads up... when trying to leave the home take the route that loops you around the  neighborhood, the ""quicker"" way had me trying to turn around on the highway all the way up the hill at least 3 times. Overall we would definitely come back to stay with these amazing host. A personal thanks to Sarah for making our stay exactly what we needed. We had a wonderful time."
89210,56280812,2015-12-11,50612886,Meg,Fabulous is all that we can say! 
89210,56422316,2015-12-13,441576,Susan,"Thank you Sara and Evan! Your guest house was perfect for staying and attending a conference. The listing is very accurate. Actually the is house better than described. The shower is fabulous with skylight and lots of space. The record collection is really  fun, from Joan Baez to Ray Charles and beyond. Wifi easy and hosts very gracious trying to make sure everything went well. The area is quiet with views of the Ocean. Stay here and enjoy the area. I hope to return. "
89210,56583989,2015-12-14,51239303,Chase,"Sarah and Evan are tremendous hosts as well as people. My night spent at their place was a joy on my journey along the coast. Very peaceful environment and respectful neighborhood. Stores and restaurants are close by and I took use of the aquarium passes, which I really enjoyed. This was my first Airbnb experience and it has left a lasting impression."
89210,56723694,2015-12-17,37084258,Pansy,"Sarah and Evan are great, thoughtful hosts. They made sure that they were there to greet us when we arrived. Sarah gave us a thorough orientation to the place and to Pacific Grove.  The place is very well appointed. The beds were very comfortable. Sarah gave us recommendations for dining and made the reservation for us at a great restaurant. They made sure our dog was well cared for while we were away. We really appreciated the care that Sarah and Evan put into making this a great place to stay.  Lovely view, very quiet, nice yard for dining. 
We really liked the place and would highly recommend it."
89210,57132563,2015-12-22,10489589,Diane,"What a great visit we had at California dreaming. Evan was a great host and local ambassador for hikes in the area and for a serendipitous last-minute suggestion for live music.

The king bed was a dream to sleep in with a great view to the sea to wake up to in the morning. The washroom was spacious with a great shower. 

We took a short Uber ride into town at night for drinks, attractions and dinner. We took advantage of the aquarium passes which was lovely and well worth the visit.

I would highly recommend a stay here and mostly I can heartily recommend the gracious hospitality."
89210,57901170,2015-12-30,26530667,Bruce,Cute little place. Evan and Sarah were awesome and very helpful. Great recommendations for food and sights to see. Great record collection and the shower is to die for.
89210,58028513,2015-12-31,4796248,Helen,"We loved this place. Clean, lovely Zen-like decor. Peaceful and great location. So much better than a hotel room. Didn't realize how close Pacific Grove is to Monterey too so getting to the aquarium was a breeze. Sarah and Evan recommended parking on Ocean View for free and then taking the short and scenic coastal walk to the aquarium. That was their suggestion to go to Point Lobos - wow, what a slice of wild California. Saw whales, otters and seals and spectacular views. We will definitely be back as this was too short of a stay to enjoy everything to explore in the area."
89210,58546700,2016-01-03,4275113,Susan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sarah and Evan's home and bungalow! Check in and check out went smoothly and they were able to accommodate our slightly early arrival. Very comfy space and our large group with kids fit just fine. We enjoyed the personal touches, beautiful gardens and art, and quiet location.  We also rented the main house, which made it a super special family reunion. Thanks again and nice to meet you both!"
89210,59228731,2016-01-08,1700423,Melinda,"We enjoyed our stay in their bungalow very much. The location was perfect for us and we loved the neighborhood. Sarah is a model airbnb host with terrific communication and lovely energy! She was so welcoming and helpful with hiking information and how to gear up for hiking in the rain.  The bed was super comfy and all the amenities are as described. Really appreciated the non-toxic cleaning products and detergents. Zeus, the wonder dog is adorable too. A great stay in one of the best places on earth!"
89210,59369881,2016-01-10,6618823,Ayah,"We loved the California Dreaming studio. Well appointed, great record collection, and what a treat to be able to visit the aquarium multiple times! "
89210,59829950,2016-01-16,42311637,Miranda,"Immaculate, inviting, and romantic. A true treasure!! Sarah and Evan's hideaway is just the place we needed to relax and unplug. Every detail is considered, and our stay was truly wonderful. "
89210,59997424,2016-01-18,26252663,Anthony,Thank you Sarah and Evan for being so accommodating to our needs. You guys are great hosts. A+ rating!
89210,60128441,2016-01-19,9840717,Rachel,Sarah and Zeus were both wonderful and hospitable. Great private and comfortable bungalow on the same lot as the host but separate entrance. Bed and shower both wonderful. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all that PG and Monterey offered. 
89210,60674973,2016-01-26,7302240,Carla,We had a lovely stay at Sarah and Evan's home.  Very welcoming hosts! The accommodations were comfortable and everything you needed was provided.  There was a nice garden area in which to relax and enjoy a view of the ocean. Stores and restaurants were a short drive away.  We would certainly enjoy staying there again! 
89210,61204223,2016-02-01,41748739,Aelee,Sarah and Evan were the most welcoming hosts. Their manual is extremely thorough and full of great recommendations for places to eat and things to do in the Monterey/Carmel/big sur area. We really enjoyed the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes too! The bungalow was serene and quiet with a beautiful view of the ocean and a garden full of succulents. One of the features that drew me to their bungalow was the vinyl collection and the nice open shower with ceiling window. There were also lots of helpful books that we used to plan our trips to big sur. The house was nicely situated close to downtown Monterey and our drive to most of the sites and restaurants was only about 10 minutes. We would definitely stay with Sarah and Evan again!
89210,61770849,2016-02-08,2419929,J Ann,"We had a fabulous time. The bungalow was perfect for a quiet babymoon. Sarah and Evan were great hosts and even sent a quick text during out stay to make sure everything was ok. They provided us with great recommendations.

Would definitely come back.

Judy and Mike"
89210,61988317,2016-02-10,20449632,Allen,Sarah is a very nice host. My family enjoyed the vacation in Monterey pretty much. The lodge is warm and nice with a beautiful garden. Sarah provided lots of useful tips to the travelers who are first time to this area. It is a pity that there was AT&T pro AM in pebble beach in that week we stayed - 17 miles drive was closed then. I hope that I can come back to Monterey someday in the future. Sarah's lodge is definitely my No. 1 choice.
89210,62146299,2016-02-12,12125408,Chelsea,"Sarah and Evan were excellent hosts. Absolutely gorgeous property, perfect accommodations, and the aquarium passes were a bonus. Great access to local attractions and wonderful restaurant recommendations. We loved Monterey's Fish House. We highly recommend the bungalow! Thank you Sarah and Evan!"
89210,62515975,2016-02-15,29768897,Sneha,Wonderful location and great hosts. We were literally living in the clouds. This place is so beautiful that you will consider never leaving it. Sarah and Evan made the stay easy and effortless. I highly recommend this listing.
89210,62935284,2016-02-18,895253,Shaila,"My daughter and I had a wonderful time in Pacific Grove. The room itself was beautiful, with a fantastic view of the gardens and the ocean. I was surprised by the additional spacious area where the microwave and small fridge was located. The bathroom with the skylight (that could be opened) was also spacious and filled with amenities. We also made good use of the hiking and sightseeing tips in the manual put together by the owners. We enjoyed our conversations with Evan. It was all special."
89210,63360300,2016-02-22,18670131,Matt,Sarah and Evan have a beautiful home with a garden and views of the ocean! They gave us great restaurant recommendations and let us use their members passes at the aquarium. Great place to stay!
89210,63572992,2016-02-24,5352537,Lauren,"We had an awesome stay at Sarah and Evan's place.  The bed was an absolute dream as was the bathroom shower.  We arrived after a day of driving up the PCH, and Sarah was very accommodating of our ever-changing schedule.  She also provided us with excellent recommendations for dining, leisure, etc.  Highly recommended!"
89210,63626419,2016-02-25,30617980,Randi,Sarah was nice and responsive to my questions. The room was like living off of a nature reserve very authentic. It was a pleasant stay for one night.
89210,63783745,2016-02-27,52242561,Ken,"My wife and I stayed two nights last weekend.   Really enjoyed the accommodations.   Sarah was a wonderful host, very friendly, explained everything to us on using the place.   It's cozy, not huge.   Great bed, bathroom and wi-fi.   Location is in a residential neighborhood that is really central to Pacific Grove, Monterey, 17 Mile Drive and Highway 1.   We plan on going back again."
89210,63913182,2016-02-28,56125343,Alejandro,"My experience with this stay was nothing short of wonderful. Even though we arrived a few hours earlier than predicted, Sarah met us at the front yard and gave us the aquarium tickets. The room was spacious and comfortable and the view fantastic. It was a short drive from the room to the aquarium and Cannery Row.  I had a fantastic weekend and it wouldn't have been possible without these great hosts. "
89210,64144414,2016-02-29,15388145,Ivan,"Sarah was very welcoming and greeted us with tips and friendly advice. Place was a bit smaller than expected, but really well decorated and the bed was really comfortable. It is a standalone unit but right next to the main house. Great view of the ocean!"
89210,64422847,2016-03-04,51072620,Shauna,"Sarah and Evan were welcoming and friendly during our exchanges before my arrival. Upon arrival, Sarah was gracious and warm (Evan wasn't present), spending time getting me acclimated to the surroundings.  They also provide a comprehensive guestbook/guidebook that is a valuable resource.
The backyard garden was lush and and colorful; the bungalow had a very tasteful, peaceful vibe.  It was an amazing experience to wake up in the (very comfortable) bed and see the ocean on the horizon.  
The location is easy to find and very close to beaches, state parks, shopping, dining, and nightlife. 
I wholeheartedly recommend this rental for business or pleasure for either an individual or a couple.  When I return to Pacific Grove, there is no question that this will be where I stay."
89210,64610840,2016-03-06,55171380,Anne,"This cozy, quiet cottage is a little gem -- beautifully decorated, very clean and comfortable, and set in a charming little garden with a view of the ocean. The hosts are very friendly, attentive, and helpful. The kitchenette is tiny but was more than equal to my needs (simple breakfasts). There is a grocery store a few blocks away. I found this a calming retreat and a convenient home base for a weekend conference at Asilomar."
89210,64899927,2016-03-08,59814963,Chloe,"My mom and I drove California's central coast and of all of the airbnbs we stayed in, Sarah's was easily the best! She was SO welcoming and helpful with things to do, places to eat, etc. Not to mention their home is so beautiful! Highly recommend this Airbnb if you're looking in the area!"
89210,65340981,2016-03-13,7857003,Jazmine,"It was a wonderful weekend away; just what my husband and I needed!  We spent Saturday walking around Point Lobos and took a great drive down the 1.  Sunday we went to the aquarium and enjoyed relaxing and watching the rain.  Mix all of that in with a beautiful view, some great food, and lovely people and it was a recipe for a great, relaxing and restorative weekend away!"
89210,65528747,2016-03-15,29126395,Jessica,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow was beyond perfect! From the beautiful zen garden, to the view of the ocean, the amazing bed, the thoughtful decorations, to the amazing shower...we couldn't have asked for more! It is so peaceful and serene and a quick easy drive to downtown. I will definitely be coming back at some point! "
89210,65790209,2016-03-17,53983533,Jack,Very nice and clean place. Sarah was very welcoming and a great host! We can't wait to come back. 
89210,66020084,2016-03-18,20868741,Damon,"Place was great, loved the garden and ocean view. Located in a really great part of town up on a hill. Everyone was right when they mentioned how comfortable the bed is. Sarah was terrific and offered great advice on things to do around Monterey. Would definitely stay here again.  "
89210,66745871,2016-03-24,13309118,Holly,"Sarah is the perfect host.  She gave us a tour of our very lovely studio, gave us tips on where to eat and even knew about a beach with purple sand.  What more could one want?  Sarah and Evan's studio is clean with a very comfortable and beautiful furnishing.  Just think, a lovely patio that looks over the ocean, a morning cup of coffee and a wonderful day of exploring ahead of you.  This is a find.  Come and see it for yourself."
89210,67852064,2016-03-31,40263991,Guy,"Thank you Sarah, we absolutely loved staying with you in your beautiful house. The room, kitchen space and bathroom was beautifully thought out and designed and everything a traveller may need was provided. 
The setting and the sea view across the garden is really special and meeting Sarah was special too. We thoroughly recommend this air b&b, it was the perfect relaxed space we were looking for. Best wishes from the Warren family."
89210,68366719,2016-04-04,5382564,Ben And Margot,"This was the ideal spot for a rejuvenating long weekend getaway with our infant son. Along with the bungalow being clean, comfortable and quiet, we loved the serene outdoor sitting area with a gorgeous view of the ocean. As others have mentioned, the bed was amazing and the shower 'sky window' was incredibly relaxing. It's also in a great location near beaches, hiking, restaurants, and the aquarium, but we ended up doing a lot of lazing around the bungalow because it was so pleasant! Sarah was super sweet and welcoming, and she made sure we had everything we needed upon arrival. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
89210,68573340,2016-04-05,64362086,Jerry,We were so fortunate to arrive on such a gorgeous day. Our hosts were fabulous and the place was in a great location close to everything. We had such a peaceful and memorable time. We would do it again in a heartbeat
89210,68717604,2016-04-06,922800,Kaycia,"We honestly can't say enough good things about our stay. From the serene beauty of the bungalow and garden, to our gracious and welcoming hosts, Sarah and Zeus, we felt so relaxed and comfortable the minute we stepped into the garden. The Pacific Grove neighborhood is perfect for sunsets and lots of dining options for vegetarians. We were looking for a spot tucked into a neighborhood, where we could get a feel for what local life was like, and this was perfect. We look forward to staying here again. Mahalo!"
89210,69230726,2016-04-10,59672565,Debbie,Sarah was very friendly and welcoming. She stayed in the main house while we stayed in the Bungalow and she gave us plenty of privacy. The neighborhood was very quiet and the view from the room was quite nice. The place was smaller than I expected but comfortable.l
89210,69966778,2016-04-15,39692869,Jeremy And Wendy,Great location. And the decor was beautiful.  We weren't there long enough to really enjoy it.
89210,70669475,2016-04-19,222414,Dave,"We had such a relaxing and enjoyable time in Pacific Grove, Ca. The bed was more comfy than we could have imagined. Waking up to the view of the garden and sea was a magical experience. "
89210,70773385,2016-04-20,29789567,Grainne,Evan met us at the drive when we arrived and gave us a tour of the beautiful space.  You can actually see the ocean from the bed!!  Fantastic shower with sky light and a vinyl collection that I wish I had more time with.  Evan gave us spot on recommendations for sight seeing and good eats.
89210,71127493,2016-04-23,57392583,Bindu,"Sara and Evan were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The moment we stepped on the property they were there to greet us. They had plenty of recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area, including a well organized binder with even more information. We absolutely loved their recommendation for Julia's Cafe (vegetarian food- probably the best salad ive ever had) and Holly's Lighthouse Cafe (amazing breakfast). The bungalow was clean, well equipped, and spacious, with everything we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable!!!! The bathroom was also equipped with everything we needed including towels and toiletries. There was an area in the closet complete with coffeemaker, teas, utensils, a fridge, even wax paper bags for storage. It was all well thought out and generous. We liked having the record player as an added bonus. The view from the bungalow is phenomenal and the garden patio is serene. The aquarium passes were also a great bonus and something worth checking out. Sarah and Evan were responsive to every text and email immediately with explicit directions on where to park and how to use the shower. 

One issue (which was hardly an issue), was that there were 5-6 guests staying in the main house at the same time as us (which they informed us of ahead of time), who were using the patio around 8 am. The bungalow is right off of the patio; therefore we could hear everything and it woke us up pretty early. They were incredibly kind and had no idea we were staying in the bungalow; therefore, it was hardly an issue. Perhaps, if guests are staying in the main house, they could be informed to just try to be quieter in the early morning.  "
89210,71415492,2016-04-25,8493646,Dustin,Wonderful little bungalow. What a view! Love the shower. Would without a doubt stay here again. Thanks Sarah/Evan!
89210,71676786,2016-04-27,28651288,Adam,"Our hosts were very welcoming and pleasant.  The listing was very accurate in its depiction of the small cottage.  We especially liked the oriental theme. The neighborhood was very safe and the location was excellent for seeing the local sites - Carmel, Monterey, Big Sur, etc. We enjoyed the succulent garden and the view from the garden as well.  The bed was very comfortable. And we took advantage of the passes offered for the Monterey Aquarium."
89210,71933450,2016-04-29,55866815,Aaron,"Sarah welcomed us into her home with open arms. Very nice, enjoyed our stay even if it was only for 2 nights. It was a treat sleeping in such a comfortable bed! And for a family of 3, we still had room to move around. Beautiful view from the garden, and loved the enormous shower in the bathroom. We enjoyed our stay in Pacific Grove and Sarah definitely helped with things to do and places to eat. We even enjoyed the company Zeus provided. We'll be back in the future, thanks Sarah and Evan!"
89210,72126382,2016-05-01,68329878,Brian,"Loved the bungalow. I did not want to head back to town to work on Sunday; I just wanted to stay! It's within minutes of Monterey, not far from Point Lobos (which was pretty amazing), and Big Sur was not far (though we didn't have a chance to head out there.) Sarah was very nice!"
89210,72340339,2016-05-02,16863078,Georgina,"We only stayed one night but it was a fantastic stay. The bed is ridiculously comfy!! And we really loved the shower with the skylight above it. Sarah was lovely and she made us feel very welcome. Having the aquarium passes included was a treat, very cool place. The location was great, just a short drive to Monterey and to Point Lobos. The perfect place to stop off on our way north."
89210,73045937,2016-05-06,2885876,Ann,My fiance and and I stayed at this wonderful Airbnb for one night. We wished we had stayed longer! Sarah and Evan were very accommodating and easy to reach. The home was clean and had a fantastic view of the ocean. It was centrally located so anywhere we wanted to go was only a 5-10 minute drive. The home also includes two passes to the aquarium which we absolutely loved. We hope to be back soon!
89210,74981906,2016-05-17,6889404,Chaz,"We absolutely loved Sarah and Evans CA Dreaming house! 
It was clean, welcoming and that bed......WOW!  The records were great for some nice ambiance and such wonderful taste in music!! Waking up to that stunningly peaceful ocean view was just fantastic.  Not to mention the lovely garden that was so well taken care of! 
Sarah was just as lovely as can be and had the best recommendations for places to eat and things to do. 
 We would recommend their home to our nearest and dearest and can't wait to stay again! "
89210,75264535,2016-05-20,61561213,Dorina,"We stayed in Pacific Grove for three nights with our little one (9 months) and really enjoyed our time there. Sarah’s bungalow is very pretty and clean in a nice and quiet neighborhood, perfect for a baby. Sarah is very welcoming and provided us with a lot of information about the city/region and gave us useful advice for our further journey.  She even provided us with a pack’n’play for our son to sleep in. We appreciated that a lot however with this the bungalow was kind of “full”. We loved to be outside the bungalow and had our breakfast and dinner in the garden; the view of the ocean is priceless. Also we get two free tickets for the Aquarium which was great and saved us a lot of money. We can highly recommend this place. "
89210,75669839,2016-05-22,44609032,Fred,"My sister and I had a wonderful time staying in this succulent heaven...the garden was amazing! The view was fantastic.  Sara and Evan were very personable. Sara even shared clippings from her garden for us.  The space is more like a room rather than a house but we would stay there again.  We were out and about the majority of the time so we ate out....brought snacks for the room but no meals.
Tip: Step Stool is under the bed!"
89210,75975543,2016-05-23,10721038,Brian,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow was everything we hoped it would be and then some! They are, by miles, the most welcoming hosts I have had the pleasure to be a tenant for. In fact, they may as well be the most welcoming people even outside Airbnb I've ever encountered! The room perfectly matched the description and the pictures do not do it justice. The open roof shower and organic shampoos and even the cucumber scented towels they provided were the highlight of the room.  The garden, which they did up themselves, is gorgeous and is the first thing you see out your window, along with an ocean view, as soon as you wake up. This room really gives you a sense of zen and peace. Sarah and Evan were also very helpful about all the know-how of the surrounding area, from tourist sites to hiking trails to the hottest restaurants. If i could give them more than 5 stars i would... But the pièce de résistance would have to be their little dog Zeus. He never bothers and comes says hi when you let him. This blind three legged super pooch (as Sarah and Evan call him) is the cutest, calmest,and hardiest dog you will ever meet! Thank you Sarah and Evan for opening your doors for us. I hope to stay in California Dreaming once again very soon!

Cheers,
Brian and Raine"
89210,76375541,2016-05-26,29895699,Meg,"Although we didn't meet Evan in person, he responded to our arrival email and Sarah (who also responded) was on site to greet us along with Zeus.  Sarah was friendly and very informative about the area and things to do.  We enjoyed chatting with her.

The bungalow was exactly as described including the view of the ocean. The bed was comfortable which is important to us.  There was a large assortment of linens available in addition to shelf / drawer space in both the bathroom and the area set up for hanging clothes / dresser / coffee / refrigerator / microwave.

Staying in Pacific Grove was perfect.  It was easy to enjoy local attractions then come ""home"" to a quiet, comfortable place and chill. In future we would stay in Pacific Grove, and at the bungalow, before looking anywhere else.

The hosts rent out their entire home in addition to the bungalow in the rear of the property so there may be other guests on the property. If so, bungalow guests may be sharing the garden area with them."
89210,76586245,2016-05-28,38045876,Fanyi,"Sarah and Evan provided us such a nice bungalow to stay. The place is cozy and clean. They prepared new towel for us and beverage. 
The bungalow is very good for couple or small family to stay. 
It was very kind of them that they left us two Monterey Aquarium passes. We used them and had wonderful time in the aquarium. The trip tips they wrote is very useful. We went to the Nepenthe restaurant which they recommended. It is a must-go place if you go to the Big Sur. 
All in all, it was a nice experience to stay in their place in Monterey! 
"
89210,77071401,2016-05-30,1640291,Jacqueline,"Superb hosts, very communicative and incredibly helpful! They truly go out of their way to help you have the best stay possible! The bed is very comfortable and the place is very conveniently located. We used Uber to go into Pacific Grove and Monterrey and both were under $10."
89210,77489565,2016-06-01,18767854,Vean,"The bungalow is comfortable and cozy, which was perfect for us to relax at the end of the day.  Good location with short drives to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and beaches.  We enjoyed visiting the Aquarium with the complementary passes included.  Although hosts were away during our stay, they were accessible via phone/text messages.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back!"
89210,77604038,2016-06-02,1852358,Mark And Adrienne,"Evan was so understanding when we arrived late and exhausted from our day and travel there.  He popped out of the front door before we even knocked and graciously showed us to their cute little cottage in the back.  The cottage was indeed like stepping into a different location!  The succulent garden they have is absolutely beautiful. There is also a very surprising and beautiful view of the ocean.  The huge King bed was very comfortable as were the pillows they supplied. (Pillows are important!)  We awoke rested and ready for the day we planned in Big Sur.  
As Schwarzenegger says: I'll ve Bach!  (And you'll be Beethoven!)  No seriously, we will return whenever we need a place in the Monterey area. Everything was just as described. "
89210,77774711,2016-06-03,52917181,Christoph,"Nach einem einwöchigen Aufenthalt in San Francisco war Sarahs und Evans Unterkunft in Pacific Grove für meine Ehefrau und mich der zweite Urlaubsort unserer Kalifornienreise. Wir wurden dort sehr freundlich von Evan begrüßt, der uns mit allen Einzelheiten des sehr sauber geputzten Apartments vertraut machte. Einen großartigen Blick bietet sich vom Doppelbett über die Terrasse auf den in der Ferne liegenden Pazifik, so dass es einen zunächst gar nicht unbedingt auf große Entdeckungstour zieht, wenn man das in einer sehr ruhigen Sackgasse gelegene Haus von Sarah und Evan erreicht hat. Das Apartment ist mit den notwendigen Küchenutensilien ausgerüstet, wobei es jedoch erforderlich ist, das Geschirr im Waschbecken des Badezimmers zu reinigen, da in der Küche keine Spüle vorhanden ist. Ein besonderes Highlightvsind natürlich die von Sarah und Evan zur Verfügung gestellten zwei Freikarten für den Eintritt in das nahegelegene großartige Aquarium von Monterey. Der Besuch dort hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Für Eintrittskarten haben Erwachsene inzwischen fast 50,00 $ zu zahlen. Hilfreich waren auch die von Evan gegebenen zahlreichen Insidertipps für Ausflüge. Wir können die Unterkunft nur sehr herzlich empfehlen."
89210,79024925,2016-06-10,71197261,Kathy,"Both Sarah and Evan were very welcoming, making us feel right at home. The room was tastefully decorated and a kitchenette was well stocked with small frig, microwave, and coffeemaker as well as enough dishes to eat in or outside on the picnic of table while enjoying the beautiful succulent garden and lovely sunset. Aquarium tickets are provided."
89210,79436785,2016-06-12,10110634,Weibo,"Sarah welcomed me on the phone and told me everything I need to know. The place is cozy and has everything I needed. It's close to 17 Miles & Pebble drive. I took full advantage of the aquarium passes and spent half a day visiting the best aquarium I've been to. 

Strongly recommend this to all visitors of Monterey/Camel area. Would stay again next time!"
89210,80378236,2016-06-17,53319903,Tina,Great place and great hosts.  Everything was as described.  The location was convenient and it was really nice having coffe with a view each morning.
89210,81178292,2016-06-21,339813,Will,Sarah's a very friendly host and her place is nice and quiet with a great view of the ocean. 
89210,81592031,2016-06-24,39299260,Yuliya,"Sarah greeted us even that we came very late. She was very friendly and welcoming! We stayed in 2 rooms , both of which were beautifully decorated :) In bungalow there was mini kitchen with microwave, table, tea, coffee machine, some snacks, water and RECORD PLAYER with some awesome records. BUNGALOW had an amazing walk in shower decorated in Japanese style. Shower was easy to use and water pressure was great. It also had a nice little window above it that you can open and enjoy the view while you shower. Bungalow has very nice view to the little garden, which overlooks the ocean and mountains. You can actually see it right from your super comfortable king size bed! California dreaming!
The other room was super cozy and comfortable for two people. Very comfortable bed.Bathroom was right next door and was shared with the owner. Also kitchen was available for us at all the times, where I was able to find great selection of teas and great coffee.
Sarah recommend us so many great places to see in the area. She made us a cup of coffee in the morning and chat with us for hours!! Also she is a great singer and song-writer ( we got lucky to get her CD for the road trip). Talking to her was a Big pleasure :) They have a dog (Website hidden by Airbnb) friendly and cute. ;) Didn't bother us at all.
I will definitely stay again at this place. Can't find anything what I and my friends didn't like.
Sarah & Evan ....thank you very much! Was a pleasure to meet you :-)) "
89210,81757221,2016-06-24,73577190,John,Sarah was most accommodating and provided good tips for our stay in the area.  Bed was very comfortable as was the futon.  Really enjoyed the patio with view of the Pacific.  Very relaxing stay!
89210,82640142,2016-06-28,32619699,Jez,"A really sweet place that was conveniently located for Carmel/Monterey and surrounding area. There was lots of clear feedback on arrival procedures and Sarah and Evan were away but we met them on their return and they were friendly and helpful. The free aquarium pass was an added bonus and well worth using and added a lot of value to our time in Pacific Grove. Neighbourhood is nice. Having a good old fashioned record player and great complimentary coffee all made for a nice experience. We would certainly use this as a base in the future. 
"
89210,83972886,2016-07-05,9008583,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful stay at California Dreaming! Evan met us when we arrived, showed us around, and gave great tips for exploring the area. We felt truly welcomed. The location was perfect for us -- it was easy to zip into downtown Monterey and Carmel and a breeze to get onto CA 1 to drive down to Big Sur. There are also multiple grocery stores and restaurants that are a short drive away. Free and convenient parking in front of the house was very helpful. We used the aquarium passes, which allowed free entrance AND access through the members' entrance, which was a huge plus. The bedroom was very nicely appointed and thoroughly cleaned throughout. The bed, pillows, and linens were very comfortable (and we are picky!). The kitchen alcove with small fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and tea kettle were really handy, especially with nearby Safeway and Trader Joe's to shop from. The bathroom is nice, with a big shower and skylight that opens to let in the fresh air. Finally, the patio area was adorable! There was a family staying in the main house, and it wasn't an issue at all. Overall we had a great stay and would love to come back!"
89210,84252356,2016-07-06,31894,Patricia,"The bungalow is in a nice residential area of Pacific Grove, very quiet and convenient to downtown and beaches. We were happy to find such a great place to stay with our pup for the Fourth of July at the last minute! (Sarah and Evan were away, so unfortunately we did not get to meet Zeus, but perhaps another time.) The communication by email was no problem — they gave great instructions for parking and use of the bungalow, and Evan recommended a great off-leash dog area at Asilomar that we were glad to find out about. Between that and Carmel Beach, Zooey was in heaven! We humans enjoyed the record collection, the beautiful garden and the ocean view outside our door. All in all a wonderful getaway."
89210,84435587,2016-07-07,6795979,Laura,"We loved Sarah and Evan's place. Evan was there when we arrived and showed us around. He and Sarah were great to chat with. The space was just as described and perfect for our overnight stop. Wish we could have stayed longer. The Bakers were very responsive ahead of time and during the stay, and their recommendations for restaurants, sight-seeing, and exploring Big Sur were so helpful. Highly recommend!"

89210,85913990,2016-07-14,24183883,Kat,Warm and welcoming were both the hosts and the space the provided. Luxury bedding and bed. On of the best sleeps I've had in forever. A truly warm and welcoming atmosphere . This is a can NOT be missed adventure while in Pacific Grove. These are true hosts that want you to enjoy and relax!  We stopped here on our way up US1 going from San Diego to Seattle. Honestly we would've have loved to stayed longer if our schedule allowed it. Stunning garden and outdoor space with spectacular views! We will return again!
89210,86193210,2016-07-15,6944898,Karin,"Wonderful in every way - gracious hosts, great location, exquisite bungalow and garden - all so inviting. There is care and beauty in every detail - this is a nourishing place that lifted our spirits."

Would definitely recommend this place.

Loved the garden, the comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom. The aquarium tickets were a huge bonus and Sarah went out of her way to give us tips on aquarium hours, parking, and more. Loved our stay!"
89210,89257727,2016-07-27,53004134,Tc,"Sarah is a great host. We arrived a bit later than arranged, but Sarah made an effort to come home to greet us and explain everything to us. Everything bit of her recommendations is great. I have had a great conversation with Sarah about many things. The place is spacious enough for us. It is very calm and cosy. We enjoyed the bay, the walks and ran the beach trails. Passionfish is great. We went there for dinner twice and we only stayed two nights. "
89210,89656407,2016-07-29,31038823,Kristina,"My husband and stayed in the bungalow on a weekend getaway. Sarah and Evan were very helpful hosts, suggesting exciting excursions that we loved, and even offering to help us out of a jam when we locked our keys in the car! The bungalow and garden are very quiet and pleasant. The bed is very comfortable and everything was very clean and well kept. Close to freeways and close to downtown Pacific Grove. We enjoyed our getaway in the bungalow!"
89210,90903418,2016-08-02,14778951,Paul And Catherine,"Evan was great. We communicated well before and during our stay. The book they provide is so helpful. Everything you need to know about the entire region. The passes to the Monterey Aquarium were super. The restaurants they recommend are spot on. Passion fish and Julia's are wonderful. The bed is the most comfortable of all Airbnb's we've stayed. The shower is great. The grounds are beautiful. We are traveling for 6 weeks, so we have lots of food. We could have used a full size fridge, but we made do. The washer and dryer are full size and first class. We highly recommend this bungalow and would stay here again. "
89210,92747047,2016-08-09,82096271,Tom,"We had a great stay at Sarah's and Evan's California Dreaming bungalow which is attached to the main house. Everything was as described, clean and comfortable. Sarah welcomed us when we arrived and even offered us the use of the main house bathroom/kitchen if we needed it.  You can see the ocean over your toes while laying in the bed and there is a neat garden in the front of the big glass door."
89210,93208266,2016-08-11,82875327,Gabrielle,Absolutely loved Sarah and Evan's accommodations.  Very charming. Close to all the places we were interested in visiting.

89210,97883470,2016-08-28,41542711,Intuitive (Debi),"This is an amazing space with an Ocean view and the best bed ever! The shower and bathroom feels like being in a tropical garden. 
Sarah and Evan are great eager hosts and they were always available to answer questions, provide recommendations and help us out with any issues. So close to downtown Pacific Grove, the Cannery Row, and a short drive to pebble beach and Carmel by the Sea. "
89210,98130253,2016-08-29,60778829,Donna,"Nice place, beautiful view, best climate on the planet.  The bed was soooo comfy!  We loved the album collection and the aquarium tickets, too.  Wish we coulda stayed a few more nights.  Next time.  Sarah and Evan are excellent hosts!  Thank you."
89210,98803146,2016-09-01,72529248,Dawn,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Sarah and Evan's. We could plainly see all the heart, thought and work that they put into the bungalow and gardens. Sarah was a great host (we missed seeing Evan and Zeus)! Available for any needs we may have had. Fresh flowers were awaiting our arrival. Recommended places we were able to try were great! The view of the ocean was AWESOME! The bed was soo comfortable. We are only sorry we didn't plan to stay longer. Thank you Sarah for making our first Airbnb stay a great one."
89210,99777169,2016-09-05,42848892,Michael,Truely wonderful hosts with a beautiful home. They were very professional and gave us a warm welcome despite our late arrival. I give them my highest recommendation!
89210,102349563,2016-09-17,72147402,Jim,Absolutely fantastic stay. Sarah and Evan are excellent hosts and I recommend their property as 5/5 stars. If in the area again I would certainly stay there once more. Pacific Grove is a beautiful little town and perfectly placed. Excellent in all respects.
89210,102922976,2016-09-19,87411638,Alyssa,"Absolutely LOVED the bungalow! Great area in a cute town with easy access to 17-mile drive and highway 1. Sarah gave so many hiking suggestions as well as other activities and places to eat. The bungalow was cozy and just enough room for my boyfriend and me. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. We had a chance to meet the people staying in the main house which was lovely, and then had a chance to meet Sarah who was lovely! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. "

The outdoor garden was beautiful with a great view of the Pacific.  Sarah met us at the house and made us feel at home.  Evan was away on business but before we even arrived he texted us some tips of places to stop on our drive up the PCH---they were great!  The aquarium passes were a bonus.  Sarah and Evan also had some get tips for places to eat and we ended up loving Pacific Grove even more than Monterey!

Evan greeted us upon arrival and gave us a tour of the main house and bungalow. He was very helpful in answering our questions and made sure we knew where everything was located. We enjoyed our stay and the view of the ocean and the garden was amazing!!"
89210,105970854,2016-10-03,37452877,Ying,"We really enjoyed staying at Sarah and Evan's place. Although it was more of a ""touch and go"" for us (a one night's stay), they were very responsive and helpful with suggested itineraries. We really appreciated the flexibility and warm welcome we received. Evan even started the heater  prior to our arrival so that we could check in to a warm room. Thanks for your hospitality!"

The bungalow was clean, very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The patio and ocean views were very welcoming. We had the greatest time playing records on the phonograph to music we hadn't heard in years. The bungalow was perfect for our long weekend in Pacific Grove. Thank you for being a great hostess Sarah. I enjoyed the selection of tea each morning and night and we loved the delicious cookies you brought us on our first night. We would love to return here on our next trip to Pacific Grove. "
89210,107668824,2016-10-11,6208105,Hannah,"Sarah and Evan were so warm and incredibly welcoming. They were very communicative and helpful prior to our arrival. The location was perfect and the apartment was simply beautiful, just as depicted in the photographs. I would love to stay here again on any future trips to Monterey/Carmel. "
89210,108123483,2016-10-14,55579095,Larry,"Sarah and Evan were terrific hosts and the Bungalow was perfect. It is in a great location, just a short drive away from the beaches and Monterey, as well as the famed 17-mile drive and Carmel. The ocean is clearly visible from the comfortable king bed if you prefer not to walk outside to the spacious patio. The shower was large and had good water pressure, with a welcome skylight above that can be opened to bring in the outdoors. The accessory room was larger than I expected, with dishes, a microwave, a small refrigerator, a clothes rack and the famed turntable and record collection. The cove featured a day bed, which again, was larger than I expected. I look forward to staying here again. It was a wonderful experience. "
89210,108856269,2016-10-17,2578110,Eric,"Sarah and Evans place is a perfect place for your Pacific Grove stay. 
We loved the vinyl collection and amazing view from the extra large bed!! Zeus (the dog) is super sweet. 
The aquarium tickets are a nice perk that shouldn't go unused. 
We never met Evan, but Sarah is very friendly and knowledgable about the area. Would stay/return anytime:)!!!"
89210,109462539,2016-10-21,92519864,Juliana,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the bungalow! Beautiful view, close to everything in Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel, and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. All of the recommendations provided for beaches, hikes, and restaurants were fantastic and using the member passes for the aquarium was great. Sarah was so welcoming and while we didn't need much from her during our stay, she was available if needed."
89210,109964382,2016-10-23,9564064,Jeffrey,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sarah's place. Very close to downtown Pacific Grove, 17 mile drive and the beach. Sarah was wonderful to meet. The space was clean and friendly… A great shower, great bed and linens etc. I think you would like staying here!
"
89210,110346836,2016-10-25,69464078,Yee Wah,"The host was very courtesy and helpful. They provided excellent restaurants advice.  Sarah was extremely friendly and spent time in telling us insight information on Monterey.   The location was in short driving distance to major tourist spots.  

The ocean view was magnificent!  The zen garden outdoor was spectular.  

Our dog found a new companion with Zeus the wonder dog!"
89210,111315179,2016-10-30,48003961,Chelsea,"Phenomenal place to stay! The comfiest bed I've ever slept in, coupled with lush towels, a spa bathroom, and incredible views! Sarah was great and available for any questions or concerns we had."
89210,112053602,2016-11-03,100423085,Ruth,"We really enjoyed staying in this bungalow. Oceans views and so close to the beach. Very good location. Great restaurants nearby. The hosts were amazing! So friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Evan recommended a great Mexican restaurant nearby and it was delicious:) They had a very cute dog, I believe his name was Zeus. We enjoyed taking our dog to the nearby beach. The shower was amazing! The bed was extremely comfortable. Will definitely be staying there again:)"

89210,112798150,2016-11-07,94665940,Rachael,"My husband and I picked this location as a quiet spot for our babymoon getaway and we brought our cocker spaniel, who they were excited to welcome. Our hosts were very sweet, courteous and welcoming and helped us feel right at home upon arrival. The neighborhood was quiet, inaccessible to outsiders which provided privacy and had very low traffic. The ocean view was beautiful, the pictures show what to expect in your home away from home and we came and went as we pleased. We were even surprised with a skylight in the shower which opens up to feel more spacious and zen like! The bed was very cozy and comfortable and we listened to some great records on their record player! We would definitely stay here again and recommend this place to friends and family. It's about a 10 min drive to Carmel By The Sea which is perfect for going into town for a bite to eat or to watch the sunset on the beach. Sarah and Evan were there when we needed them for questions or assistance but they also gave us the space we needed to enjoy our personal vacation. We loved it here and cannot wait to stay again in the future! "
89210,113025158,2016-11-09,2548411,Tien,"Lovely Airbnb with a view, centrally located for exploring Monterrey, Pacific Grove and Carmel.

89210,113267861,2016-11-11,21784850,Ashley,"Stayed here with my boyfriend on a drive up the coast. The hosts were very easy to communicate with and were so warm and welcoming when we arrived. The guest house is very peaceful and the view unbelievably pretty. There is a little kitchen area stocked with all the essentials, including a record player which I think of as essential. :) I highly recommend staying here. I'm looking for an excuse to come back! "
89210,113790400,2016-11-13,90252009,Lauren,"The bungalow is a quaint little cottage off the back of the main house. There is a beautiful little patio which is shared with the main house. Though there were guests staying in the main house, we did not bump into them and were able to enjoy a quiet evening on the patio sipping wine while overlooking the ocean in the distance. The bungalow, while close quarters comes complete with a full bathroom. The shower has a sky window which allows plenty of natural light during day time hours. There is a small ""kitchenette"" in the bungalow as well which includes a microwave, coffee pot, kettle and a record player. The hosts, Sarah and Evan supplied coffee, tea, sugar etc along with dishes for use if needed. The bed is quite comfortable, however my husband and I really enjoyed the pillows (silly, I know). Sarah greeted us upon our arrival and gave us the run down of the bungalow and offered suggestions on places to eat and visit during our stay. Communication with the hosts was extremely easy and clear. We would definitely stay again at the bungalow in the future. Perfect for two people!! "
89210,114102833,2016-11-15,102895777,Terrie,Beautiful place. Sara made us feel like we were at home.
89210,114333033,2016-11-17,13905356,Clara,My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the bungalow. The location was very nice for easy access to both Carmel and Monterey. Loved the record player and the secluded succulent garden with ocean views in the morning. Coffee was delicious too! Would definitely stay here again. The dogs enjoyed meeting Zeus too! Thanks for having us! 
89210,114600027,2016-11-19,1462384,Sarah And Alexis,Great spot with a beautiful garden and ocean view. It worked well for our short family visit. Sarah was lovely and  made us feel very welcome.

89210,116024700,2016-11-27,7261960,Ruchir,Central Location to visit Monterey and Carmel-By-The-Sea. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway.
89210,116238102,2016-11-28,47313479,Byung Gun,"Warm host. 

But the location is not for the good place to watch ocean.
I selected this because it is written as Ocean View.  
But if you expect Ocean View of beautiful ocean of Monterey, you will be disappointed. 
It is located in a small town, not in ocean side. 

Anyway it's is OK. 
But it is written that is for 10 people,  but it has a double bed and single bed. 
We were 4people,  we had to slept packed in 3people in a double bed and one person slept in a single bed. 

Host kindly said to us that one person may sleep in his room in their main house,  but as you know it is not possible to 3of us stay in a guest house and 1of us stay in host house. 

And the bed sheets in the room were not laundries bed sheets.  Many guests have used it many times. 
My kid with allergy should have remove many dusts on the bed sheet. 

And 4people stayed in one room but one room is too small. 
One double bed and one single bed and small table filled most of the room already. 
No more space even for standing and opening the big bags.

And if you stay there in Summer,  it would be OK. 
But cold season,  you should listen the weird clicking sound of warmer when you sleep. 

I could not sleep with the noise and asked host to replace it.  Host thankfully gave us other electrical warmer. 
Thank you very much. 

For considering price
If I pay the room fee and service fee cleaning fee of 303usd to stay in Monterey,  I would rather stay in the hotel near the ocean with beautiful facilities and wider room with the price.

89210,117081388,2016-12-04,33164434,Clayton,"Evan was an excellent host!  He made sure to give us a tour of the guesthouse when we arrived and was also checked in with us before we left to ensure we had a great time. (which we did!)

The pictures depict the guesthouse perfectly. It was very clean and stocked with an ample supply of basic amenities.

A definite recommendation to anyone who needs lodging in the area!"

Took a Trip down memory lane with music from the 60's-80's.  Loved all the reccomendations for activities, hikes, and restaurants.  Helped us create a magical experience.  I would add Rio Grill in Carmel Valley as an amazing meal experience.  Hope to make it back.  Thank you!"
89210,120775773,2016-12-11,31368347,Stefanie,"Sarah and Evan's bungalow made for a super cozy, sweet stay in Pacific Grove. 

I initially misinterpreted pricing and capacity details, but it was my mistake, and a reminder to read airbnb listings more carefully. 

Sarah was in excellent communication, and communicated clearly and with great kindness. The bungalow is not inexpensive, but it is extraordinarily cozy, well equipped, and charmingly decorated. The bathroom is gorgeously designed, and the main bed is huge and comfy.

Overall, super charming place to stay!"
89210,121915075,2016-12-19,10770150,Catlyn,"Sarah and Evan's studio was a perfect place for our family's one night stay in Pacific Grove. They were very welcoming and easy to communicate with. The gave us directions to the nearby beach where we enjoyed a beautiful sunset. Dinner options were a short drive away. The studio itself is just as pictured, well appointed with thoughtful design touches. And the step in shower was lovely. The following day we were able to use the membership passes to take our 4 year old to the aquarium - a great added value! All in all, wonderful hosts and a great spot. Thank you!"

89210,125424771,2017-01-05,35889972,Juliet,"Evan and Sarah are the loveliest hosts. From the first moment we met we were instantly made to feel at home. Sarah took the time to chat with us and show us around the bungalow when we arrived. Our daughter was enamored with her! We met Evan later on and he too showed us what a kind and thoughtful host he was. Thank you for the warm hospitality Sarah and Evan. Your bungalow and garden are beautiful and magical. It makes you feel as if you are away from it all, just the perfect relaxation we needed. At the same time the property is so close to all the conveniences such as the aquarium and Carmel-by-the-Sea. The location simply could not be any more perfect. We truly had a wonderful stay."
89210,125777645,2017-01-07,4492661,Stephanie,"Sarah and Evan's place was exactly was was described; peaceful, cozy, quiet. We both loved the record player and the shower with the skylight!

The bed is super comfortable. And let's not forget the great location, the free tickets to the aquarium and being so close to the ocean! Lovely all around!!! Thank you Sarah and Evan! "

It's not super handy to shops and restaurants, although there is an amazing vegetarian restaurant nearby (and this is coming from a carnivore), but if you want some fresh air, great views and a relaxing base to visit the area from this place is perfect. "
89210,131781520,2017-02-13,48106839,Randall,5 minute drive to the beach and 5 minute drive to the aquarium. Excellent back house for a weekend getaway. 
89210,131913157,2017-02-14,94905375,Leslie,The pictures do not lie. The space was perfect for our one day stay. The view was the main reason we booked this room and it as perfect to wake up to. I adore the sitting area that was connected between our bungelow and their house.  It was so nice and relaxing to sit there and drink our coffee. The room was the perfect space for the both of us and the bath was nice with the natural light coming through the ceiling window. Definitely going to stop here again.

89210,135642363,2017-03-05,8201601,Jess,"A group of us came to stay at Sarah and Evan's place for a birthday weekend gathering. Sarah and Zeus, her sweet pup, were home while we were there, and were wonderful hosts. It felt like being at home with friends. The space is so beautiful and cozy: we loved the plants, the light, and the amazing succulent garden. We had a great time gathering in the living room in the mornings and evenings, eating meals, sharing conversation over coffee, and playing games. The beautiful shower in the bungalow (with a big skylight overhead) was another highlight. We also had a great time exploring the area: going on a couple hikes, checking out some beaches, and (of course) visiting the Aquarium. We would come again in a heartbeat!"
89210,136263656,2017-03-09,3635890,Matthew,Beautiful place.  A great home base for exploring the Peninsula.

Quarters slightly tight but made for excellent value and was exactly what we sought. We had an absolutely wonderful stay in Sarah's studio! We so appreciated her restaurant suggestions, parking advice, aquarium passes! Couldn't have asked for a better host & certainly hope to return to this neck of the woods sometime soon!"

Sarah was a fantastic host and was very accommodating to our up-in-the-air arrival time. The record player was a very cool touch and it was fun to sift through the records to find the right music for the evening. My wife and I will definitely stay again, the next time we are in the area."
89210,138043251,2017-03-18,4261753,Yong,Sarah is such an awesome host giving us sense of belonging. 
89210,138833821,2017-03-21,41761528,Ed,"Quiet and peaceful, with a view of the ocean in the distance.  A great location for basing your explorations in and around Monterey Bay.  The Aquarium tickets are a great bonus.  Sarah was an excellent host, communication was easy.  It's not fancy, but it's got everything you need (note that there is no tv, which we think is a very positive thing).  Highly recommend."

89210,140759936,2017-03-31,7485873,Fiona,"A lovely cosy place to stay. Very clean and a gorgeous view of the coast. Sarah was extremely kind and gracious in helping us with whatever she could. The place has wonderful views of the coast from the top of the hill and is central to Monterey if you have a car. We walked from her house a few times but it's a few miles and uphill the whole way back so only really suitable for those who are reasonably fit and like to walk. However parking is easy in the towns so as long as you have a car, it's no issue at all. We  had a wonderful time there and would happily recommend it. Thanks Sarah!"
89210,141934356,2017-04-05,117478209,Megan,"View was amazing!!! And, Sarah was so helpful giving us recommendations and helping us make the most of our time there."

We didn't really have to worry about anything, check in was easier than easy and we loved jamming out to the vinyl records! The location is great, but be warned that Monterey Bay is often cloudy, which means your view may not be as blue as in the pictures. The garden will always be beautiful, though. Definitely recommend it!"
89210,155178609,2017-05-27,18610663,Brendan,"Great little spot! It's not big but we slept two adults, a kid and a dog with no problem. Excellent view, comfy bed, sweet record collection, perfect restaurant recommendations... We loved it. "
89210,156078601,2017-05-29,47846333,HyunJoo,"This bungalow was charming and very clean and comfortable! You can sit on the bed and look out the glass doors to the beautiful ocean. My husband and our two dogs had a wonderful stay. We were a five minute drive away from Asilomar Beach (where dogs can go leash free) and a short walk from a forest dog park! We planned this trip for our dogs - to spend lots of cuddle time with them and take them on outdoor adventures - and this was truly dog's heaven, aka my heaven! "
89210,156688001,2017-05-31,1559821,Terry,What a lovely and very comfortable accommodation. Sarah is a wonderful hostess and her setting is so beautiful. My only hesitation in recommending is a fear that she will be too booked up for me to return!
89210,156920747,2017-06-01,22277664,Liz,"Really cute, super private guest house in a safe, centrally located neighborhood. Sarah was great and communicated with us in a timely manner, and also let us borrow her aquarium passes! The house ""guest book"" also came with some great dinner/activity recommendations. Her dog Zeus is so cute and sweet, which was an added bonus! "
89210,157162352,2017-06-02,18280910,Lynda,"Sarah's place was a real treat. I only regret we didn't have more time there. Do take advantage of the aquarium passes and Sarah's hiking adventures. Beautiful room, garden, and location."
89210,158454646,2017-06-06,16519149,Julia,"Wir waren nur eine Nacht dort. Doch der Aufenthalt war sehr angenehm. Schade nur, dass die Küche etwas spartanisch ist, denn der Rest ist wirklich ausgezeichnet. "
89210,159116151,2017-06-09,26144677,Joseph,"Great place, we especially loved the shower and the bed."

89210,160321629,2017-06-13,20316909,Irini,"California Dreaming was exactly what we were looking for: Beautiful interior decor, a lovely garden, and upscale amenities."
89210,160815181,2017-06-15,116792363,Ed,"Wow......what a fantastic location for a stay on the Monterey peninsula!  Quaint and super clean cottage with a small private patio overlooking Monterey Bay.  Enjoy the library of music your hostess provides via LP records while preparing a cup of java in the morning.  Sarah, your hostess, is a beautiful person and goes the extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable experience.  I would highly recommend this Airbnb as a place for those people looking for a quiet spot to stay while vacationing in Pacific Grove.
"
89210,162182449,2017-06-19,65685207,Katie,"A wonderful place. Comfortable bed, large walk-in shower with skylight, and amazing view. "
89210,162594080,2017-06-21,114897553,Elizabeth,"Nestled behind the house at the top of the hill in Pacific Grove sets this hideaway where simplicity is the virtue.
The architecture is inviting and unique; the shower has a skylight! Light on kitchen amenities, but fridge and coffee pot are included."
89210,163827406,2017-06-25,118739603,Rhonda,Great place to stay while visiting Carmel and Monterey ! Aquarium tickets were a plus. Location was great.  Sarah was a great help. She gave us valuable insight and info only locals would know!! Gardens are great and room was comfy. We were able to use the washer and dryer which wasa Huge help!!! 
89210,164317693,2017-06-26,132387975,宽永,"The rooms are neat, beautiful and extremely comfortable, Sarah is a really nice and helpful host, she is an artist and a good planner. Her suggestion made an amazing trip for me!"
89210,164801220,2017-06-29,51379340,Donna,"Sarah is an amazing host. She greeted me and was available when needed but not intrusive by any means. The bungalow was perfect for me and my little dog Cooper. At first I was surprised by no TV but I was exhausted each day and the views and sunset spectacular. Her garden is amazing. Would not hesitate to recommend and to come back every time I'm in the area. Very convenient to Monterrey, Pacific Grove and Carmel. The aquarium passes are a true gift, I had not been to the aquarium in over 20 yrs. "
89210,165716653,2017-07-02,128385369,Sinja,"Die Zeit bei Sarah war toll. Sarah hieß uns herzlich willkommen und gab uns zahlreiche gute Tips. Der Bungalow ist unglaublich liebevoll eingerichtet und es gibt sogar eine kleine Küche mit Mikrowelle, Kühlschrank, Toaster, Kaffemaschine und Wasserkocher. Die Dusche ist toll gemacht. Das Bett ist größer als man es sich vorstellen kann, sehr bequem und bietet einen Blick aufs Meer. Für die kalten Tage gibt es eine gut funktionierende Heizung, unsere Rettung ! Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt :) Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind nur ein paar Autominuten entfernt. Die Straße ist ganz ruhig. Der Garten von Sarah blüht wunderschön und wir konnten sie manchmal singen oder Klavier spielen hören. Sarah war eine tolle Gastgeberin. Einfach toll :) "
89210,166182014,2017-07-02,56529185,Gina,"Sarah was such a gracious host, aommodating and very kind. Our travel plans were a bit rough as we were coordinating with two other groups staying in the area but at different homes. She was very flexible and understanding of estimated arrival and allowed us do check-in a little early. The property is beauriful, set on a hill with views of the ocean from the bed. It is in idyllic setting; beautiful garden booking with native flowers and plants. Above all, it was quiet and relaxing. So much so that I slept for 10 hours! "
89210,167168064,2017-07-05,57262507,Jocelyn,"Lovely home and enchanting garden! Sarah and Josh were incredibly flexible with the check-in time, which was great since there are so many wonderful sights to see nearby. The decor was inviting and the record player and vinyl selection was a hit with my family. Had a great night of sleep :) "
89210,168046585,2017-07-08,40798124,Lisa,"This place is fantastic! A perfect base for exploring the Monterey peninsula. Very centrally located and easy to get to everything. The accommodations are immaculate, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. Sarah was on vacation during our trip, but her son Josh was an excellent host. He even did our laundry for us (all we did was ask where the washer was and the next thing we knew everything had been washed, dried and folded!). We enjoyed listening to the records on the record player. The garden is absolutely stunning. Definitely stay here if it is available, you won't regret it!"
89210,168971642,2017-07-10,127448164,Leanna,"This place is so great! It's extremely clean and comfortable. The bathroom is so pretty and he shower with the skylight is amazing. The view to outside is beautiful and relaxing. Josh (Sarah's son) was an excellent host who gave great suggestions, was very friendly, all while giving us our space. Would come to this place over and over again!"
89210,173131780,2017-07-22,121736608,Lisa,"We loved the view and privacy. The bathroom with skylight is beautiful. We had lots of fun playing the vinyl records. The free aquarium tickets were awesome, as well as the aquarium. We definitely recommend this special stay for your vacation in Monterey Bay!"
89210,177124693,2017-08-01,46198822,Ignacio,"The house and the room are awesome! You will enjoy either the house and the sorroundings. Sarah gave us a real kind welcome and give us some ideas about the plans to visit the place.
I will recomend it!!
Great place!"
89210,177731001,2017-08-03,67504048,Christina,"This is a perfect place! Wonderful view, comfortable bed, super clean, beautiful landscaping and a great guide book. The passes to the aquarium were an awesome benefit; if I recall correctly it's about $100 for 2 people to visit! 
Sarah was available for sightseeing tips and other suggestions. 
It was a great experience and we'd definitely stay again."
89210,178123780,2017-08-04,4797042,Julie,"Sarah was a wonder host, before, during, and after our stay. She was so sweet and made us feel at home. The best was the fresh delivered coffee to our door when we woke up in the morning. We had a wonderful time!"
89210,179107128,2017-08-06,51473868,Kati,"Sarah was a phenomenal host. Based off of previous reviews I had high expectations and she definitely met, if not exceeded, them. Communication was awesome and her local knowledge/recommendations really helped make the trip. By far the most accommodating/helpful Airbnb host I've encountered. Would definitely stay again."
89210,180568456,2017-08-10,75625181,Orit,"This space is truly special. Amazing garden, tranquil bungalow, and comfy cozy bed! Sarah and Evan do a lot with a small space. The record player and collection are an added bonus. Great location, peaceful atmosphere. Would recommend!"
89210,180977360,2017-08-11,93215781,Zachary,"Sarah was a great and communicative host. Her place was beautifully put together with a stunning bathroom/shower and view of the ocean. She also has a succulent garden that is of one's dreams! She suggested some great restaurants that made my girlfriend and i's anniversary wonderful. Thanks so much for the wonderful short getaway, Sarah!  

Zach and Mackenzie"
89210,182491877,2017-08-14,61700209,Meg,"Sarah's place exceeded every expectation we had. Little things matter and the  attention to every detail, both inside the home and outside in the garden added beauty, convenience and comfort to our trip. Following Sarah's travel tips made our visit to the area a once in a lifetime experience. The comfort of the big bed, the skylight in the giant shower and the classic vinyl albums were awesome too!  Sarah, thank you to you and your beautiful family."
89210,182899916,2017-08-15,16679292,Jim,"This was a perfect one night stay as my wife and I traveled from SD to SF. Depending on your personality, more than a couple of nights could feel a little tight. We did enjoy playing the albums, and going down musical memory lane. It was an easy drive to Big Sur, and we took advantage of the aquarium passes in Monterey, which was worth the adventure.
Sarah's gardens are very impressive. The variety of plants, and blooms are wonderful."
89210,185104725,2017-08-20,8540884,Faraz,"Great place, super charming.  Would love to stay here again if ever in town.  It's really a great spot that feels like a well kept home."
89210,185856927,2017-08-22,73681241,Yuan,A pretty and quiet place to visit the Monterey area
89210,188260383,2017-08-28,88488948,Summer,Sarah was very nice and helpful. The bungalow is a fun place to stay. My family loved the shower.
89210,188828974,2017-08-30,105620380,Tyler,"Sarah was a great host and the room was fantastic. The view of the ocean with the succulent garden was fantastic and was perfectly located between Monterey, Carmel, and Big Sur. Sarah provided great recommendations and our stay was excellent. Highly recommend!!"
89210,189458601,2017-09-01,37570265,Rod,"This is a true gem! We loved staying at Sarah's place, the record player plying in the background while we enjoyed the view of the ocean! It wS really hard to leave. Book this place without hesitation!  "
89210,189767901,2017-09-02,6050827,Walid,Great and very accommodating host combined with an Amazing ocean views. The best in Pacific Grove hands down! 
89210,191492718,2017-09-07,5214834,Aly,"The California Dreaming Bungalow was a perfect couple's getaway for us and our dog. Check in was very easy, and the location was well-situated between all the sights in Monterey and Carmel. The bungalow itself is very clean and well-decorated, and the extensive record collection was a wonderful addition. Sarah was an excellent host, with great recommendations for restaurants and hikes. We will definitely stay here again during future visits."
89210,192987263,2017-09-11,121568450,Kathleen,"Honestly, this was such a wonderful experience. We were newbies (our first Airbnb), and Sarah could not have been more gracious, accommodating and friendly. It was the quiet, Zen experience that my husband and I hoped for, and more. Sarah greeted us upon our arrival and showed us ""the ropes."" We had the beautiful patio to ourselves the whole time - and what a gorgeous view of the ocean! Bonus points alert!: Sarah has a phenomenal vintage (mostly) vinyl collection. She has Frank, Ella, some great country like Hank Williams, as well as Joni Mitchell, Donovan, Jefferson Airplane and Moody Blues (just to name a few, seriously).
If you are looking for a quiet spot, with a view, with an awesome king-sized bed (might be a California King?!), then I would highly recommend California Dreamin'."
89210,193239756,2017-09-12,10282256,Adam,"We had a great stay at Sarah's place, although it was just for a night. Ocean views from the bed, a great vinyl collection, complimentary Aquarium passes, and a skylight above the shower were just a few of the highlights. Sarah also gave a great recommendation for dinner (Passionfish). Highly recommend!"
89210,193741430,2017-09-14,111660956,Laura,"The patio is full of gorgeous succulents & amazing breezes, with a small view of the ocean below.  The king size bed was very comfortable, and had luxurious sheets! 
The open air shower was magnificent, & Sarah has added so many personal touches!
It was very relaxing!"
89210,194042368,2017-09-15,13044566,Derek,"What a lovely home, and Sarah was super communicative and helpful"
89210,195532696,2017-09-19,24447522,Rick,"We loved Sarah's place! It's cozy, private and well-appointed - perfect for our getaway to the Monterey area. I really loved waking up to a view of the ocean, the serene garden and the quiet neighborhood, perched above it all. We hope to go back!"
89210,196613266,2017-09-23,7556687,Karam,This place was great. The nice king size bed and really nice shower with skylight were a welcome addition to a place to stay in beautiful Monterey. Very centrally located close to everything and the backyard and ocean view were beautiful. Sarah was very welcoming and accommodating and would we'd definitely recommend staying as her guest when in Monterey.
89210,197518960,2017-09-25,36995259,Tim & Stephanie,Flawless check in. Close to downtown. Aquarium passes a great perk 
89210,198247209,2017-09-28,146235455,David,If you choose to stay here you will be in paradise. You enter into a garden retreat and sleep with views of the Pacific. The king size bed and pillows are amazing. The space was very clean and unique. Loved the bathroom with a standing spa shower and skylight. A vinyl record player with a unique music selection was a whimsical complement to our travels. Pacific Grove is charming and close to Carmel-by-the-sea with so much to do. Accessible hikes/walks with awe inspiring coastlines are at your fingertips. Great food and local coffee shops. The space is beautiful and Sarah is a great host. Very highly recommended.
89210,198844840,2017-09-30,27277822,Kevin,"Sarah's place was a dream. If you're in the area, this is the perfect place to spend your time. Sarah was warm and hospitable throughout our stay, and even encouraged us in our relationship."
89210,200005419,2017-10-03,8319223,Karen,"It is little wonder that Sarah's place has 500+ glowing reviews. It is everything you could want from an Airbnb: clean, comfortable, stylish, well appointed and with a huge comfortable bed with ocean views. It is pretty spacious - far more so than some of the reviews suggest - and a totally peaceful place to hang out. A short drive to some really good restaurants and shops in Pacific Grove but well away from the tourist hoards in Monterey and Carmel. Sarah was friendly, laid back and welcoming and an excellent communicator. We loved it. Highly recommended. "
89210,200797337,2017-10-06,2919830,Jessica,"We absolutely loved Sarah's guesthouse and were sad when it was time to leave. Sarah is a super warm and welcoming hostess and we very much enjoyed meeting Zeus, as well. We had plenty of privacy and especially enjoyed access to the backyard with its spectacular ocean view and the sound of hummingbirds playing in the many trees surrounding the property. It is so very peaceful, yet we never had to travel more than a few minutes to get to the attractions we were interested in seeing.  There's a Trader Joe's and the cutest French bistro (Fifi's) about 2 minutes away. The spa-like bathroom with a skylight that opens above the huge shower was just dreamy. The beds were both comfortable, as well. We slept very well there during our stay - both because of the beds but also because it was so quiet. We would absolutely stay there again. Thank you, Sarah!"
89210,201719239,2017-10-08,2440649,Tracy,Sarah's place is a lovely little oasis tucked up in a quiet older neighborhood. The view is beautiful. The bed is very comfortable.  The very basic mini-kitchen provided all we needed. Shower was nice & warm. A nice quiet escape from the tourist action. Sarah is also great with communication.
89210,202518912,2017-10-11,150195040,Mitchell,"Stay here if you happen to be in the area - Sarah's bungalow is awesome, and she gave us a ton of great tips of how to maximize our time in the area. We will be back next time we are in the area!"
89210,203878450,2017-10-15,12684136,Ashleigh,"Sarah is an experienced and very knowledgeable host, leaving you plenty of information on the areas of interest on the pacific coast, only thing I did not realise was it was much further to get the beach than I imagined. You do need a car.
We had a lovely evening socialising with Sarah and her friend and if you enjoy meeting people this is a great choice. The studio is just as shown in the photos, probably best suited for a couple, but my friend and I were very comfortable with the bed set up. 
I would happily recommend Sarah's studio to future guests travelling in that area."
89210,204558477,2017-10-18,44259201,Julie,A great space with an even better vibe. Amazing view. Secluded even though you're in a neighborhood. Sarah was a great host. She was as involved or as private as you wanted. Awesome record collection (don't steal them!!!) Would stay again without a doubt.
89210,204996283,2017-10-20,14771305,Hannah,"Sarah's place was exactly as described - the sea view, AMAZING bed, quirky decor - I only wish I had stayed longer! Loved the open window above the shower too. There were some issues with the electricity but that was out of anyone's control, and Sarah was so apologetic and nice about it when she didn't really have to be :) Carmel itself is a beautiful town, and I would definitely come back (and stay at Sarah's again)!"
89210,206982442,2017-10-27,133290041,Kendra,"California Dreaming is a serene oasis tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood. It is close to anything you might want to see while still being removed from the tourist action, and the view is spectacular! I could have happily spent our entire trip lounging in bed staring out the sliding glass doors at the beautiful ocean view. My husband and I were vacationing with our 8 month old daughter as well as our dog and we all fit comfortably, even with a pack n’ play. The bed is comfortable, and I love the sky light in the bathroom! It gave the shower an outdoorsy, spa-like feel. Sarah is also a wonderful host. She is friendly, responsive, has a lot of great tips... and our daughter loved her :). We already want to plan another trip, and will definitely stay here again."
89210,207706514,2017-10-29,978966,Dana,Great quiet and relaxing space. Simple  no nonsense and totally adequate as a convenient and clean place to stay
89210,208281692,2017-10-31,2200172,Peter,"Wonderful place to stay and enjoy Monterey and Pebble Beach. Cozy, quiet, and clean. Sarah was incredibly helpful and accommodating. Thank you Sarah!"
89210,208528134,2017-11-01,29183687,Adrian,"AMAZING bunglaow with a view of the ocean right at the foot of your bed. My wife and I could not have been happier with this rental and would highly recommend everyone to stay! Within a 5 - 10 minute drive of many restaurants, Sarah's recommendations were spot on and very glad we listened to her. Would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!

Thank you Sarah!"
89210,209700073,2017-11-05,132872221,Michael,"Six out of five stars! The stay at Sarah's place was beyond expectation. 

The landscaping is beautiful. The view is beautiful. And Sarah is beautiful. Completely worth the stay. 

We love the Monterey area, and this was a perfect home base for us."
89210,210316856,2017-11-08,92508336,Morgan,"Great experience! We didn’t get to meet Sarah, but Evan was very friendly. We enjoyed the surroundings and nothing seemed too far away from the house (all within 10-15 mins). We also liked going to the aquarium. As well as getting to play records throughout the day while we were home. Overall, great experience!!"
89210,212025608,2017-11-15,12799982,Kristy,"This was my second time staying here and it was as good or better than the first. The bungalow leaves nothing to be desired, my pups loved the yard. It's so close to everything and Sarah is great about answering any questions or telling you where to find parking, good food, etc. A beautiful place and my first stop any time I'll be in the Monterey area!"
89210,213097078,2017-11-19,28731308,Kathrine,We had a great time at Sarah’s place! Her place was very clean and cozy! We loved the sweet garden and the Japanese-themed room. Her place was close to everything. Most of all Sarah was very flexible with us and accommodating! She checked in and made sure we were comfortable :)
89210,213549504,2017-11-21,54729596,Jennifer,"Perfect, just as everyone reviewed."
89210,213884937,2017-11-23,8459150,Lawrence,"Sarah's bungalow was perfect for our needs. We took a short trip from SF to Monterey (my wife, 2 month old and myself) for a couple days and the bungalow was perfect. We met Sarah when we arrived as she was on her way out for a walk and Sarah was so kind in providing recommendations and making sure we felt welcomed and everything we needed was provided. The bungalow is through her garden in the back with a nice view of the ocean from the entrance to the bungalow. The size of the bungalow was perfect for us with a King bed, a side twin bed, a small table and seating area, and a relatively spacious bathroom and a small kitchenette area where we were able to put the pack n play for our baby to sleep. The place was very clean, everything we needed was provided, and was very comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend the bungalow!"
89210,214837708,2017-11-26,44748122,Alicia,Just as described! Lovely quiet getaway!
89210,215132916,2017-11-27,28523109,Hannah,"Cozy studio room, beautiful area, very quiet and private. Sarah is kind and thoughtful! Very helpful as well."
89210,215575491,2017-11-30,156590565,Robert,Was sick and had to cancel last minute. Sarah was very nice and offered a discount for a  future visit. 5 stars
89210,216371897,2017-12-03,11340844,Ross,Great cozy place. Excellent local tips.
89210,216943960,2017-12-06,97529062,Sonora,"Sarah’s home is amazing, from the bed to the view to the shower. She is a wonderful communicator and is willing to help with anything you need/have questions on. The room is perfect for a couple on a nice getaway from the city noise. She is perfectly located and I️ couldn’t of asked for a better place to stay. This is the BEST home I️ have ever stayed in. *please do check out the jade plants in front of the apt. They are huge and probably the most beautiful jades I️ have ever seen..."
89210,218037016,2017-12-10,26256954,Bee Deborah,"Sarah is a super welcoming and helpful host. If she gives you local tips, take notes because she's right on the mark!
The ocean view really is that spectacular. I was wondering how it was going to be visible from the bungalow, but we were able to see the ocean right from the bed. It was so soothing. 
It's such a lovely spot for our short getaway. It's close enough to the town center that you can grab a delicious meal, but far enough so that you really feel you went somewhere magical. 
We highly recommend visiting California Dreaming. Enjoy! "
89210,218746119,2017-12-14,41166447,Jessica,"This house is amazing! It’s located close to everything you’d want to see including the aquarium, which is free thanks to the passes :) 17 mile drive starts minutes away and Big Sur is close with great views on the way! Sarah made check in extremely easy and the house was cleaner than any Airbnb we’ve stayed at. The bed is so comfortable and parking is a breeze. Sarah was great from the beginning of planning our trip and I’d highly recommend staying here if you get the chance! We visited Big Sur and point lobos the next day and could not believe the natural beauty at both places. Sarah’s guide book was great and helped us a lot. Do yourself a favor and stay here :)"
89210,218936563,2017-12-15,29893292,Abigail,"Sarah's place was excellent! It was exactly as described, from the ocean view to the beautiful garden. We loved the record player and the skylight in the shower. Additionally, it was great to have some recommendations for the area and we really enjoyed the aquarium."
89210,219522813,2017-12-17,41910772,Yiwei,fairly good host. Gave us lots of informative of the area. Although we already have our plans of travel. But she is always nice and ready to help.
89210,219938647,2017-12-19,132715096,Daniel,"Sarah is a great host and very helpful with local knowledge of the area.  We also loved the aquarium passes, it's a must see.  Very cool record player and collection as well and a great sunrise with a view of the ocean."
89210,220299682,2017-12-21,100724340,Coral,"This bungalow is centrally located with easy access to hot spots in Monterey. The backyard is so gorgeous, just overflowing with luscious plants; you can tell there was a lot of time put into it. If its winter when you stay make sure to bring warm jammies, I was freezing, but the bed it cozy and warm. I would not recommend staying with kids unless your child is a little older, its more for a romantic getaway. Sarah was so kind and helpful, she chatted for a bit when we got there but not overbearing during our stay."
89210,222777494,2017-12-30,152912408,Russell,"The place was awesome, the view was awesome, the host was awesome, and even the weather was awesome. Thanks Sarah, for making our first AIRBNB experience so perfect."
89210,223775026,2018-01-01,17935897,Karthik,"Sarah's place was pretty great for us to stay over the New Year's Weekend. It has a great king bed with a kitchenette, and a very well appointed bathroom. We were also excited to see a bed/couch/sitting space that converted into a dog bed for us. Her dog, Zeus, was very sweet and friendly as well. Sarah herself was very helpful throughout the trip, and her tips for local restaurants/things to do was incredibly helpful. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a romantic weekend in the Monterey area."
89210,225235071,2018-01-05,324017,Ruiqi,"Everything was perfect. The space was sparkling clean, tastefully decorated, and conveniently located. Thank you also for the aquarium tickets, we truly enjoyed our Airbnb experience!"
89210,226263728,2018-01-09,145054775,Emily,"We loved our short but sweet Anniversary trip to Sarah's bungalow! Despite the rainy weather, the view was just gorgeous! We loved interacting with Sarah; she is a delightful host! 
If you are looking for a cozy, quaint and clean stay in the Monterey Bay Area- Sarah's spot is perfect! "
89210,227052015,2018-01-13,126869444,Tom,"Lovely airbnb in a really nice location, with amazing garden and view out onto the sea. Sarah is incredibly friendly and welcoming, and gave us lots of excellent tips for the local area that helped us to enjoy our stay."
89210,227420869,2018-01-14,76048526,Maggie,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Sarah’s for a short trip, and it was beautiful. The view from the bungalow is breathtaking, especially right when the sun starts to set. All the little details were great - from the well designed shower and spacious room, to the great selection of vinyls that she has ready for your listening pleasure.

The location is great too -- less than a 10 minute drive to the aquarium or downtown Monterey, and very easy to find in a nice neighborhood. 

Overall, we loved our stay here and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great getaway."
89210,228050715,2018-01-17,70513640,Lisa,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we were very happy! The view and surroundings are so peaceful and relaxing, just what we were looking for. Sarah provides great recommendations, we used her instruction letter as our go to guide. We slept wonderful and woke up to listen to the ocean each morning :)"
89210,228235624,2018-01-18,7616526,Cait,"Sarah’s space was super clean and comfy, and we really appreciated her flexibility in allowing us to pick up the guest passes to the aquarium earlier than the check in time! We’d definitely recommend it!"
89210,229079082,2018-01-21,133643966,Jenni,"This was exactly pictured, beautiful gardens and ocean view. A quiet and mindful experience. The great records and record player are icing on the cake. If you bring a child, it is ideal for an older child. We will go back without the toddler next time!"
89210,229457723,2018-01-23,28968121,Swaati,"We had a great stay at Sarah's place. Sarah was thoughtful, communicative and a very caring host. I will happily recommend her place to family and friends. "
89210,229801828,2018-01-25,92005591,Josh,"Sarah's adorable cottage was perfect for our family of 3. The vinyl collection, the ocean view, the epic mattress, and Sarah's friendly hospitality made our little vacation a success. Definitely recommend!"
89210,230025612,2018-01-26,166473725,Ericka,"Anyone who is lucky enough to stay at this AirBnB and have Sarah as their host is in for a treat! The area is absolutely beautiful, with a lovely garden filled with succulents and a gorgeous view of the ocean. The home itself was immaculate and my girlfriend was absolutely jealous of the vinyl collection Sarah graciously lets the visitors have access to. Little Zeus was just adorable and the whole atmosphere was calm and inviting. I highly recommend staying here if you can. I look forward to future stays because one night just wasn’t enough!"
89210,230699786,2018-01-28,50698430,Madison,Amazing location. Beach View! Perfect bungalow with beautiful garden. Great record collection! Sarah could not have been nicer and more accommodating. Really enjoyed our stay.
89210,230950395,2018-01-29,5815186,Sofia,"Sarah's place was fantastic! The most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on, the room was super clean and had everything we needed/expected. The view is beautiful, you can see the ocean from bed, and the backyard is lovely! Sarah was super helpful and communicative, the neighborhood was an easy distance to everything, quiet and easy park and navigate. We loved that the aquarium passes were included, and all her local tips were super helpful! Thank you Sarah for a great stay!"
89210,231518121,2018-02-01,160171183,Bill,See my previous commitment.
89210,232646042,2018-02-05,5086201,Margaret,"Sarah's place is gorgeous in the way that Van Gogh's room at Arles is gorgeous. It's all you need: a lovely bedroom looking out onto a beautiful garden with a view of the ocean, a simple kitchenette, and a fantastic shower. Sarah is an extremely gracious host, and her dog, Zeus, is adorable. It was a perfect place for our little family (two adults + a 2yo) to spend a long weekend."
89210,232846679,2018-02-06,166268330,Vasilios,It was a pleasure to stay at Sarah’s Bungalow
89210,233222883,2018-02-08,94247142,Amy,Sarah's place is a serene retreat in paradise!  The guesthouse is clean and cozy with a very very comfy bed and a skylight over the shower.  We arrived just in time to see the sunset over the pacific ocean with a glass of wine in Sarah's backyard. The view is stunning and we wish we could've stayed longer! It was so nice to be greeted by Sarah and her very cute 3-legged dog Zeus upon our arrival.  She had great tips on where to eat in Pacific Grove.  We would definitely recommend this place to any of our family and friends.  Hope to be back someday soon!
89210,234146802,2018-02-11,49281883,Noel,"What a great little place to stay! We always look for places with their own entrance and bathroom, and this was perfect. Central location, close to many area attractions. There is a wonderful binder in the room with Sarah's favorite restaurants and hiking, which was really helpful. We ate at her number 1 restaurant called Julia's and it was great. We also did some of the hiking listed, which was perfect since I hadn't done research on that. Loved the little side room with coffee maker, mini fridge, microwave, and plates. Sarah was always responsive and helpful. Oh, and the included aquarium tickets are a great perk. It costs $50 for an adult ticket to the aquarium, so having the tickets included allowed us to see that while we were there. Parking spot is also a plus, even though we ubered quite a bit. Thank you Sarah!"
89210,234438078,2018-02-12,82476703,Amy,Can’t beat the view and the price.  Lovely to use the recommended places we went to hulas and the lighthouse cafe and used the aquarium passes. Thanks for a great stay.
89210,235421014,2018-02-16,125991784,Desiree,We stayed 4 nights at Sarah’s place.  It was really nice to lay in bed looking out at the ocean and listening to Sarah’s large collection of vinyl albums.  Sarah was very nice and always responsive.  Her place is very close to Pacific Grove and a short drive to the aquarium and Monterey.
89210,236665867,2018-02-19,27334657,Daniel,"Sarah was a fantastic host. She greeted us when we arrived and told us everything we needed to know about the bungalow and the area. She offered great tips, and even gave us restaurant coupons and two passes to the Monterey Aquarium which go for $50/person.

The location was great, very close to restaurants, bars, and the ocean. We loved the ocean views from the bungalow and how clean it was. The shower with the sky window was an amazing touch. King size bed was very comfortable and the bungalow comes with a kitchen and other supplies. Sarah also put together a booklet full of great recommendations. 

10/10 stay. Will definitely return."
89210,237112436,2018-02-21,91511077,Wendy,"I took my elderly mother for a getaway. My sister decided to join us, and little did I know there was an extra person charge each night of $45 which was wanted in cash. The description said you could have 3 people, so I didn't understand the extra charge. It was a cute place, with a great view, but small and no TV. Usually not a big deal, but the Olympics were on and we wanted to watch. Also, the last night our parking spot was taken by our hosts friend. I had to drop my mother off, and find a parking spot. Not happy."
89210,237655698,2018-02-23,101468607,Sherry,"Sarah is awesome! Don’t hesitate on this booking! Of the four airbnbs we stayed at thru out Cali, hers was the best!"
89210,238467231,2018-02-25,26565795,Derek,"You can’t go wrong here, this place has a great view, convenient location, and warm host. This was the kind of place you write home about for my wife and I."
89210,238763722,2018-02-26,749522,Joey,Comfortable bed and great views of the ocean!
89210,240908887,2018-03-06,22610796,David,"Lovely spot with great private yard and view of ocean...quiet
Well maintained...great bed and shower sublime. Sara is a super host!
Responsive and kind!
Will return if we are in area...
Also excellent value...."
89210,241592849,2018-03-09,105282062,Chloe,Sarah’s place was very secluded and quiet. Had a great garden space and view. King size bed was wonderful and the huge shower was luxurious. Had all the amenities we needed. Good location for easy driving down to the water.
89210,242363112,2018-03-11,76976954,Dan,"Beautiful setting, quiet surrounding, a great place to stay. We had a wonderful weekend."
89210,242906070,2018-03-13,68178116,David,Nice and cozy little spot.
89210,243632247,2018-03-16,166423830,Barbara,"Sarah is a lovely host. From the initial arrangements and reservation process and throughout our visit. Welcoming, friendly. We really loved California Dreaming-with it's lovely views, beautiful succulent garden. The indoor space was clean, comfortable and relaxing. My partner REALLY loved the record player and the music selection. Such a great touch! Also a great bonus were the Aquarium tix and detailed House Manual with restaurant recommendations. They were right on point! We brought my girlfriend's dog (a Corgi) and the space worked well for her too! I would love to come back and would recommend California Dreaming to friends. Thanks again, Barbara and Jeannie"
89210,244499211,2018-03-18,26014070,Rachael,California Dreaming is a little slice of heaven! It is close to everything and Sarah is a lovely host. We hope to visit again!
89210,244882921,2018-03-19,173707060,Lynn,"Sarah’s place is outstanding! Super comfy bed, lovely garden, great view, eclectic vinyl collection, and wonderful suggestions for hikes and restaurants."
89210,245294584,2018-03-21,49803478,Simon,Great view in an amazing garden. We loved the (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy bed and good record collection to listen to music. Nice location and the house and town made the rainy days bearable.
89210,246069647,2018-03-24,163054190,Suzanne,"Wonderful view, quiet, close to everything."
89210,247233042,2018-03-27,15792971,Vivian,"We loved our stay! We had two adults and two young children ages 5 and 1 yo. 

Evan was super helpful, friendly, and offered a lot of good advice on things to do, places to eat. The location is perfect- lovely, quiet neighborhood, beautiful ocean view, close to Asilomar Beach, and close to Monterey. 

The kitchenette is small, with no sink or oven, but ok if you want to just make coffee and have cereal. 

The best part was the aquarium passes! Our kids had a blast, and so did we!"
89210,247512575,2018-03-28,5019155,Megan And Joe,"A wonderful place to stay! This is a cozy little space with a big comfortable bed, great bathroom, well appointed kitchenette, beautiful garden, and amazing views of the ocean. The best bonus is the free admission to the aquarium! Sarah also left some wonderful suggestions in the binder (all her restaurant recs were spot on, and the parking tip for the aquarium saved us a lot of time and money). The kitchenette is great and we enjoyed breakfast out on the patio. For others considering bringing a baby or toddler, we found that we had plenty of space with our 21-month-old. We actually set up the pack-n-play (Sarah provides one or you can bring your own) IN the kitchenette space, behind a little curtain, so we could still keep the lights on after our daughter was asleep. There would also be room for it at the foot of the bed. Overall a fantastic Airbnb experience."
89210,248152021,2018-03-30,2779733,Michael,"I stayed at Sarah's place with my wife and 10 month old daughter. 

We had a great stay and was a really great location to explore Monterey. When we arrived we realised that we had misinterpreted the size of the place from the photos. Where we had thought there was a bedroom and a living room there is in fact just one room with a small curtained off kitchenette and en-suite bathroom. The misunderstanding was completely our mistake - we hadn't looked at the listing clearly enough. 

We were able to use the kitchenette as a cot room for our daughter so that we had a little bit of space whilst she slept. 

The bungalow has a really comfy bed and the views from the garden are brilliant. 

Sarah was always quick to respond to messages, and Evan (who we met during our stay) was very friendly and helpful. We even got to meet Zeus the dog. 

The aquarium tickets are a great bonus and we made good use of them. The aquarium was really interesting and had lots to see and do!  

Thanks again to Evan, Sarah and Zeus!"
89210,249149201,2018-04-01,10093133,Kate,We really enjoyed our stay. Great hosts and a great location.
89210,249758744,2018-04-02,119343608,Sonali,Great home to spend the night for a comfortable sleep an refreshing shower. Friendly hosts with great local tips.
89210,250328127,2018-04-04,53928471,Lesly,"This place couldn’t have been more perfect! From the beautiful backyard scenery and views to the very comfortable and cozy space, we couldn’t have asked for more! It’s location was on point! Close to Carmel, Point Lobos and Big Sur! And to top it off, Sarah was a wonderful host! A 5 Star stop for sure!"
89210,250967966,2018-04-06,26559576,Corey,"Beautiful space, felt like we were in the pacific grove botanical gardens! Coffee maker, record player, comfortable bed and great outdoor seating made this extra homey."
89210,251887341,2018-04-08,93132858,Arianna,"The bungalow was so cute. It was small, but it has everything you need. The view was awesome, and the location was perfect. So close to the aquarium!"
89210,252470035,2018-04-10,128367602,Darcy,Sarah’s Place was fantastic! A nice big bed with views out to the water made for a wonderful morning! The record player with all types of genres of music was amazing. And the indoor shower with skylight was a cool experience. Location was perfect to and from Monterey/Pebble Beach/Big Sur. The whole experience from check-in to check-out was A+. Highly recommend!
89210,253233035,2018-04-13,84710354,Alexander,"Sarah is a great host and super helpful. Beautiful place. Loved the location. She put together her own guidebook/binder that is really great for helping with the surrounding area including Big Sug, Carmel, Monterey, etc. She put together a neat kitchenette with coffee, teas, cups etc. Would love to stay again!"
89210,253536162,2018-04-14,75481852,Sarah,Sarah was an amazing host! She was extremely helpful with local recommendations for hikes and restaurants.  The place was gorgeous and the garden was beautiful. The space is extremely relaxing and I would definitely book again!
89210,254685875,2018-04-17,15526439,Tom,Sarah is a great host and her place had everything we needed for our stay. Be sure to checkout her restaurant recommendations inside a binder in the unit that's packed with helpful info on the area.
857942,3652013,2013-02-28,4520529,Alejandro,"This studio is a wonderful place to stay, spacious, neat and complete. The location is the best part of it, 2 minutes walking to the beach, in a very quiet neighborhood. The landlady is a very nice woman who wouldnt doubt to help you with anything you need. I frankly reccomend this place for a relaxing stay.
"
857942,9524602,2014-01-01,2168809,Greg,"I was in Monterey for a week to hole up and do some writing; therefore, I was looking for a quiet place with no distractions but also walking distance to the waterfront and restaurants. This studio was perfect. It sits at the back of a house, and it feel like a separate unit most of the time. I was able to work in the quiet and comfortable space. A pleasant surprise was the little village of Pacific Grove. I walked there every day and found a great restaurant or coffee shop every time. It's also much quieter and less touristy than Monterey itself. All in all, a great experience."
857942,9967458,2014-01-21,11333686,Belen,"Wonderful space, great location. Space is large and cozy. "
857942,10270523,2014-02-10,2790799,Gerhardus,The studio is at the back of the house making it nice and quiet.   It is clean and well equipped.  The location is great.  Easy walk to all the main attractions along the beautiful coast line.  We will return.
857942,12824758,2014-05-12,7173111,Laurie,"My experience at the studio was OK. The place was very quiet and walking distance to the town and the Ocean.

 I was able to concentrate on some computer work while visiting my father so the kitchen was useful to provide a home cooked meal which is why I booked the studio.

Virginia always responded to any questions I had during my weekend stay which was much appreciated.

"
857942,13183923,2014-05-21,13977219,Jared,"My wife and I stayed at Virginia's studio for four nights at the beginning of our honeymoon.  The space was spotless and spacious, and the pull-down bed was quite comfy.

While we never did cross paths with Virginia, she was a great host and was quick to respond to our questions via email both before and during our stay.  She'd even left several bagels, a block of cream cheese, some OJ and some coffee for us, which made our mornings very easy!

The neighborhood in Pacific Grove was sleepy (we found most places around there and in Monterey closed VERY early in the evening, even down in Cannery Row!), and there were very few streetlights, but the area felt quite safe.

On foot, the studio was well within range of most Monterey destinations (Cannery Row, the aquarium, etc) as well as Pacific Grove's charming coast and great little downtown.

By car, the studio is about 15 minutes from Monterey Regional Airport (MRY), and just 5 or 10 minutes from Highway 1, which with its breathtaking path through Big Sur was our main destination during our stay.  Carmel is also about 15 minutes away and is a great place to check out for a fantastic date night (we recommend Dametra Cafe!).

Our only slight difficulty with our stay was with the wireless internet connection in the studio; the signal was quite weak which made browsing for directions and destinations for our trip slow going.  Still, we relied very little on the internet so it was by no means a big deal.  We would certainly stay at Virginia's studio again the next time we're in the area!"
857942,14079212,2014-06-11,13498911,Kristin,"My husband and I stayed for a week visiting the area. The apartment was perfect, very quiet and close to the walking trail, downtown restaurants and bus lines. There's space to park a car too. The kitchen had all that we needed, bed was comfy and there was room to spread out. Virginia is available and helpful/friendly but we rarely saw her. Highly recommend."
857942,16706264,2014-08-01,12336568,Charles,"This is a great place to stay for a visit to Pacific Grove or the Monterey Peninsula. Virginia, the owner, lives in the main house and is very helpful and friendly. Although I didn't see her much, she always responded to my questions. The studio is very comfortable and the location can't be beat. It is about 3 blocks to Lighthouse Ave. where you will find multiple shops,  restaurants, coffee shops, a gas station, and even a small grocery store. Even better, Lover's Point is only a 3 block walk in the other direction where you can access the trails that go all the way to Asilomar beach or to Cannery Row, the Monterey Aquarium, and Fisherman's Wharf. You can rent bikes and kayaks at Lover's Point. It is easy to drive to Carmel, Monterey, or Big Sur from this location as well. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. The P.G. municipal golf course is very close as well. It is really a great place to stay for a single traveler or a couple. "
857942,17497560,2014-08-13,13668382,Glen,"Rosemary and I enjoyed Virginia's studio apartment for both its privacy and proximity.  The studio is located in the back of the home.   The street noise is negligible and the morning piano sounds are welcoming.  I loved the short walk to downtown Pacific Grove for morning coffee and old fashioned newsprint. 

We will book again when our daughter graduates next May.  I highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the Monterey area.

857942,17813259,2014-08-18,11082340,Marilyn,"Contact with host was by text primarily, email and once by phone. There was some miscommunication as a result of the limited contact and info by texts. We thought we had a garage as advertised, she offered a lower rate, we accepted but print out info said garage was included. We arrived, no garage access because she said in text, the lower rate didn't include it. Never saw the host. Accommodations were fine,location good."
857942,19114553,2014-09-07,14094747,Pb,The reservation was canceled 148 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
857942,22942078,2014-11-18,7996102,Juan,"I spent a month in Virginia's studio and very soon I was feeling like at home. It is in a very nice location, close to Lovers Point, with some restaurants very close and in a very quiet neighbourhood. Virginia was great. I only had one problem, with the WiFi signal, and she quickly updated the service to improve it. Overall, a great experience and strongly recommendable place."
857942,25201922,2015-01-09,19237849,Alexei,"We spent a week in Virginia's apartment and then extended for one more. The studio was like described, very spacious, clean and bright. It's equipped with full-sized kitchen and has all required kitchenettes, including small things like sugar, tea, Virginia also provided us with welcoming food and it was great as we arrived late. The studio is located on the rear of the house and is very private. The location of the studio is great, it's Pacific Groove, minutes to Lovers Point and the ocean. We liked our location even more than Monterey itself, it has a lot of beautiful houses, very close to the ocean, Monarch sanctuary, 17 miles drive, Asilomar It takes about 20-30 by walk (with beautiful sights over the ocean) to Monterey Bay and Aquarium, with a lot of shops, restaurants, but that area is very crowded. Still, if you like to stay in a quiet place, close to the nature - Pacific Groove is fantastic. We had a car, no problems with parking. WiFi worked ok. There was a grocery shop within 5 mins walk and laundry with good service within 2 mins, bikes rental is 5 mins walk. Communication with Virginia was ok, she provided us with all info we needed. We wish we could stay longer, as that location and the studio were so great. If you need to stay in Pacific Groove / Monterey, especially for longer stays - this studio is a great choice, my wife and I recommend it much. "
857942,25679837,2015-01-23,22058015,Stephen,"Unfortunately our experience was less than pleasant at Lovely Studio.  We rented the studio for a month and as the time neared for us to check in we tried to communicate with the host regarding amenities. (We were curious about things like a coffee pot, toaster, crockpot, etc.).  The host replied with accusations of parties and overnight guests and suggested we cancel our reservation.    She indicated that we were not to cook in the kitchen as it may produce ""cooking smells"".

We tried to alleviate her concerns and explained that we were a retired couple that wanted to spend some time in the Monterey area with family.  We did not intend to throw parties or be disruptive, but indicated that it would pose an  extreme hardship for us to eat out every night (and the listing did advertise a full kitchen).

The host appeared to relent somewhat by saying she had been burned in the past, but did firmly state that we were not to bring a bunch of ""stuff"" into the studio.  

We decided to make the best of it and went ahead with the rental.

After our arrival we found a very charming unit.  It was perfect in most every way except we felt like we had to walk on eggshells so as not to upset the host.  We were extremely quiet and tried to insure that we were not disruptive.  After three days we received a notice from the host that bicycles were not allowed on the premises.  We had rented two bikes and parked them on the advertised ""private patio"" in back of the unit.  They were out of the way and did not pose a problem for anyone.  The host threatened to make inspections of the studio and asked what else we were ""hiding"".

We finally contacted Airbnb and lodged a formal complaint.  Airbnb was exceptional to work with and really went to bat for us.  They read the email series that went back and forth with the host and contacted the host.  They were able to secure a 100% refund for nights not used and tried to find us an alternative location (Everything was very booked up in the area).

While our experience with this unit was very negative, we will certainly consider Airbnb for lodging needs in the future."
857942,25984438,2015-01-31,1410478,Stephan,Everything was equal & superior to the online information.Very clean. With her prompt handling Virginia made it possible for us to make initial contact and arrival the same day. Great location.
857942,26568164,2015-02-15,12266737,Krisy,"GREAT location, comfortable, plenty of space for 2. Virginia was clear in her instructions for us and allowed us privacy. We will definitely be staying here again when we are in the area.  Thank you!! :)"

857942,29170380,2015-04-05,17655322,Andrew,"Our stay at Virginia's studio was wonderful.  The location is perfect, just a few blocks from the beach and Lover's Point in one direction, and one block from the walkable Lighthouse Avenue in the other, where we found a number of delightful cafés and restaurants, as well as a clean and convenient laundromat.  The town of Pacific Grove is a relaxing and welcoming vacation destination, and Virginia's studio has the same feel.  The apartment was well-furnished with a comfortable bed -- always important -- plenty of fluffy towels, and, in the kitchenette, we were pleased to find a French press among other conveniences.  As a host, Virginia gave us absolute privacy and was still attentive about communicating via Airbnb.  All of our questions were answered promptly.  Arrival and departure were both smooth and easy.  If we find our way back to PG, we will definitely stay here again."
857942,29931945,2015-04-14,29537122,Felix,The suite was lovely. No complaints.
857942,33259810,2015-05-26,30786510,Anderson,"Nice and cozy place in an beautiful neighborhood!

Virginia gave us our privacy so that was really nice. Although we stayed here primarily to wash up and sleep. Great location to explore Monterey and Carmel.

The heater is loud but it heats up quick during the cold nights, and we set it low so they place stayed warm. The two bars of facial soap and no blow dryer was the only inconvenience. The bed was also a bit uncomfortable but that could be preference. overall the stay was good.

Very relaxing area to stay at.
"
857942,35095833,2015-06-15,12952943,Richard,"Everything was great: location, studio, & host.  Easy check in and check out.  My girlfriend and I had a great experience and we would stay again.  Easy walking distance to Pacific Grove beaches, shops and restaurants.  Bed was comfortable and WiFi worked great.  Super price for a super location!"
857942,35457791,2015-06-19,9971639,Rick And Linda,"Great neighborhood, place was just as discribed we never meet Virginia. The studio was very very clean, and comfortable. "
857942,35806203,2015-06-22,15592799,Alex,"Virginia's studio was perfect. The studio was clean, spacious, and beautiful. Everything Virginia described in the listing was completely accurate."
857942,37962609,2015-07-12,31626123,Hannah,"We arrived fairly late (9:30pm) the first day and the host was very understanding of our late check in time which was very nice. Aside from the initial communication we only saw the host once and she was very friendly.  The listing was very accurate and a short distance from the beach and also a short walk from a lovely street with many local restaurants and cafes. The studio was large enough for two people and had all the essentials (fridge, stove, microwave, ect) to stay there for an extended period of time (we stayed two weeks). The neighborhood was quiet at night and is easy to walk around. I would definitely recommend this rental to anyone interested staying in the area. "
857942,38663294,2015-07-17,20617230,Brandon,"Good place to stay if you're coming to visit the monterey peninsula. Never met/saw our host, but communication was easy via text. For the most part the place was clean, like the previous comments the fridge was loud but didn't bother us. Street parking was not an issue. Best part of the trip was being able to walk to a bunch of local coffee shops, restaurants (Passionfish was sooo good!), and Lovers Point. "
857942,39172729,2015-07-21,34475048,Trina,"My husband and I had a lovely time staying here and exploring the Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel area.  Everything was accurately described and we felt very comfortable.  Lover's Point was a short walk away and the aquarium and cannery row was a short 5 minute drive away.  We were blessed with very warm weather all weekend long.  We would recommend it to our friends in the future!"
857942,39492641,2015-07-24,1770591,Debra,"This is the 5th or 6th AirBnB we've rented and the first in which we had a hostess/host that disappointed us. 

First, the good parts: great location for walking to Pacific Grove and even Monterey. Good Internet. Clean. She had plenty of nice towels for the bath.

The not-so-good parts. 
--- The bed is terrible and the pillows are no better than towels. When I asked her about other pillows (and a fan. . .the room was airless b/c it's in the back of the house) all I got was an abrupt ""no.""
--- There is a patio off the room, but only a rusted out bistro table and chairs. Again, I asked if there were other chairs for the patio. The answer was ""no.""
--- The kitchen is sparse. You're in wine country and there are two tiny wine glasses. And explicit instructions that the kitchen is to be used for only ""light"" cooking. 

But the final straw was when I emailed the hostess about the construction going on next door, saying we wished she'd told us about it (this was after asking about chairs and pillows). Her response was that since we were ""obviously not happy"" with the place, she would return our money. Had no idea where that hostility came from. Since we had only one more night and didn't want to move, I declined. If we had been staying there more than 2 nights total, we would have left.

Do NOT recommend renting this place."
857942,40923496,2015-08-03,15978262,Christy,"This was a great place!  Virginia communicated with us but was very conscious of giving us our space.  Place was clean and in a GREAT location. We road our bikes to Cannery Row, Lovers point, Pacific Ocean  and Pacific grove.  We were given space in the garage to park the bikes so that worked out well. Thanks for a great stay , Virginia!"
857942,41998287,2015-08-10,38184471,K,"We stayed here on a long weekend.  The studio is in a great location which is walkable to the water.  Street parking was easy at different times of the day /night. The bathroom and kitchen were very clean; there was an abundance of towels which we appreciated. Communication with Virginia was clear and efficient.  

Some preferences which would increase the comfort - consider upgrading the bedding and pillows and adding additional lighting. 

As another reviewer noted, there was construction on the property next door. Because we arrived on a Friday afternoon, the noise stopped at a normal business time and did not continue over the weekend, so it was not an issue for us.  "
857942,42526800,2015-08-14,34530324,Monika,"Great location. Perfekt studio: spacious, comfortable, very clean, quiet and absolutly privacy. We spent a wonderful time in this lovely studio. Thank you, Virginia!"
857942,45952177,2015-09-07,19989280,Christina,We loved the neighborhood and location of the studio. We could easily walk to restaurants and the coast. Everything was as described and we fell in love with the French Press. We had never had French pressed coffee and it was such a treat for us! The only minor issue when we arrived was trying to find exactly where the studio was located once we went in the exterior door. A sign might be helpful to direct guests back past Virginia's home to the studio. Otherwise we had plenty of privacy and had a lovely time.
857942,47959797,2015-09-22,34197046,David,"Nice, clean, cozy and convenient. Near the beach and downtown Pacific Grove. Virginia was organized and responsive, easy access, we had no issues. Quiet street, a remodel next door, but kind of low key. "
857942,49021859,2015-09-30,626513,Dustin,"Had a great time staying here. The studio was in an excellent location (walking distance to beaches, great restaurants, a bit longer but manageable walk to the aquarium), quiet, extremely clean, and had the most towels I've ever seen at an AirBNB (very appreciated!). It was easy to find the place as Virginia put up a sign. Would be happy to stay here again next time we come to the Monterey area!"
857942,49816451,2015-10-06,31548388,Jim,We had a lovely time and the place was exactly as advertised.  The apartment was beautiful and comfortable.  The location was fantastic as we were easy walking distance to the ocean especially Lover's Point.  It was so nice to have a kitchen so we did not need to eat out much.  There were good pots and pans but it would have help to have a few more kitchen utensils but it was adequate for our needs.  Parking was very easy with plenty of spaces.  We did not met Virginia but it was everything we were looking for.  We would definitely go back and highly recommend it to anyone.

857942,54367325,2015-11-19,6656284,Mark,Comfortable studio well located in Pacific Grove.  Within walking distance to the major attractions in Monterey.  Multiple excellent restaurants are a few blocks away on Lighthouse in Pacific Grove.  My wife and I enjoyed our stay.
857942,55147714,2015-11-28,22350018,Scott,Virginia's studio was just as described. It was very clean and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The location was excellent and within easy walking distance of many attractions and restaurants. I highly recommend Virginia's studio to anyone who is passing through the Monterey area.
857942,55495232,2015-12-01,23582277,Anand,"The space was warm and well kept. We happened to be visiting on a chilly November weekend and the heat, fireplace, and kitchen were great for warming up and having a simple dinner after a day spent hiking in the cold."
857942,57073511,2015-12-21,17160867,Arun,Virginia's place was very comfortable. Perfect for 2 people. It was clean and well maintained. Great value if you are trying to stay for a weekend at Monterey. 
857942,57917577,2015-12-30,1717775,Betty,The studio was as listed.  Very comfortable with a nice patio that the weather prevented us from using. Everything was tidy and we enjoyed the oranges that she left. We had big fluffy towels and plenty of hot water.   Our visit was for a week.  We only met Virginia once and she was friendly.  The location was perfect.  We rode our bikes and could walk to Pacific Grove for shopping and meals.  The Red House was excellent for breakfast and the bakery was fabulous.  Our family lives within a mile so this was just the ticket!  We would stay here again.
857942,59553394,2016-01-11,34117955,Ardis,"Virginia left us a nice note with helpful info for the area. The studio had everything we needed, and was clean and comfortable. Great location! When we had an issue with the heat, Virginia took care of it immediately!"
857942,60653118,2016-01-25,34592479,Elizabeth,"The studio was lovely - just as described.  Cozy, quiet and safe for a girl traveling alone.  Could walk to brunch and to the ocean (Lover's Point) which has a beautiful many mile ocean front walk.  Great location, great host, great studio - will definitely stay here on my next visit to Pacific Grove!"
857942,62421909,2016-02-14,56784377,Christine,"The studio is as sunny and welcoming as the photo, and meticulously clean.  It is furnished and arranged with guests in mind.  Because of its central location, we could walk to restaurants, shops, bakeries and the monarch sanctuary, not to mention enjoy the pristine coastal trail.  "
857942,63650898,2016-02-25,9585595,Harold,The listing and pictures accurately describe the studio and location.  Virginia was a gracious host and everything was ready for me when I arrived.  The location is near scenic lover's point and many good restaurants.  
857942,64161941,2016-02-29,25393025,Mike,"Great experience all around. Very centrally located: brief walk to Canary Row and a few blocks away from the beach and great restaurants like Passionfish. Virginia was very conscious of our privacy and the studio was very clean and comfortable.

All in all, I highly recommend renting her Studio."
857942,67009006,2016-03-26,20402397,Celeste,"We had a great time visiting Monterey and stayed in Virginia's studio behind her house. It was very clean, quite, some cooking capabilities. We were less than a 5 min walk from Lover's Point. She was very accommodating with a place to store our bikes. There are some great restaurants, coffee shops, Laundromat, and a quirky little Ice Cream shop within walking distance. You are a 5 min drive from the Aquarium or 15min bike ride on a very nice bike trail. Great value and location. We loved Monterey/Pacific Grove. Thanks Virginia"
857942,68018854,2016-04-01,711331,Veronica,Our stay here was great! Such a great location :) 
857942,69355708,2016-04-11,6120682,Paul,We had a wonderful stay at Virgina's Studio.  It was a great location (within a few minutes walking distance from downtown Pacific Grove and from the coast).  The space was clean and ready from the moment we arrived.  Parking was very easy and we could come and go without a fuss.  Great place.  Look forward to staying there again.
857942,70177659,2016-04-16,50068738,Julie,Great location. Spacious apartment. No interaction with host however which is not what we are used to with Airbnb. However for some this may be ideal. 
857942,71395868,2016-04-25,22744404,Yogeetha,"The photos show exactly how the studio looks. Its a nice, small cozy place apt for 2 adults."
857942,72515290,2016-05-03,4703867,Nancy,"This is a clean, lovely studio apt with lots of privacy. Perfect for a quiet stay in PG. Very close to Lover's Point and downtown."
857942,73502520,2016-05-08,14627704,Tina,"Victoria was very easy to communicate with. The apartment was as pictured in photos and very closely located to both Pacific Grove downtown and Lover's Point. Fast internet, well supplied kitchen for simple cooking/reheating. Overall great option for a quick weekend getaway."
857942,74422858,2016-05-15,17470251,Laura,"Virginia's place is just as the listing- clean, homey, and close to all the Monterey attractions. Kitchen was well equipped, internet was fast, bed was clean, and there were more than enough towels. Great stay! "
857942,75705199,2016-05-22,38565869,Beth,We had an amazing time at Virginia's cozy little studio. Quiet and Private.  It was a short walk to Lovers Point. 
857942,78288877,2016-06-06,4756034,Ron,We really loved the location of the apartment.   It was within a short  walking distance both to Lovers Point and the many great restaurants in town.   The apartment was light and cheery and very comfortable.
857942,79268247,2016-06-12,70631292,Deborah," Virginia's studio is exactly as described and pictured on the Airbnb website. Not pictured on the website but a pleasant surprise is the lovely landscaped courtyard area that is on two sides of the unit. Virginia is clearly an artistic and skilled gardner. 

The studio is well equipped with everything necessary for basic meal preparation. I used the microwave, the refrigerator, and the coffee pot and all worked. Virginia provided plenty of clean and fluffy towels, and hot water was plentiful for showers and washing up in the kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised to find a hairdryer, Neutrogena soap, and Trader Joe's shampoo. 

The neighborhood is safe and convenient to the main shopping area in Pacific Grove and to Lover's Point. On street parking is free and plentiful. 

Check in was easy; Virginia graciously accommodated a slightly late check in caused by a flight delay. Check out was also easy.

This was my first Airbnb experience and I had no idea what to expect. Based on this experience I would book through Airbnb again. "
857942,86223631,2016-07-15,25099097,Carol,"Cute little studio apartment. Quiet neighborhood. Close to everything. Very responsive owner. Very secure. Beautiful plants surrounding the apartment. Refrigerator was a little loud (for sleeping), but not too bad. One side of the bed is very close to the wall (less than a foot). Adequate bathroom. Good-sized kitchen. Could have used somewhere comfortable to relax after a day of sightseeing - couch really isn't that comfortable. Overall, though, it was a fine place to stay. We enjoyed our time there. "
857942,87381964,2016-07-19,39735032,Martijn,"Nice and clean apartment, close to the beach (5 min walk) and a very nice town and street."
857942,89533065,2016-07-29,67389717,Brian,"My wife and I just spent a week at Virginia's.  The area is very quiet and the accommodations worked well for us. There is no TV but the wifi is fast and we streamed Netflix a few times. The bed is very comfortable and we slept well.

Pacific Grove may be a better location than Monterey. PG is vibrant, but no serious traffic, and there are great restaurants.   2 hours from SJC and easy/close access to Monterey, Carmel, and the coast, which is awesome.  I didn’t play golf but the local PG Municipal Golf Links is reasonably priced and is similar to the exorbitantly priced courses in the area.
"
857942,94336776,2016-08-15,67835942,Nicholas,Nice location. Very quiet but close enough to the beach to walk and close enough to great restaurants to drive or uber. The room was great. Set up for longer visits or short like ours. The bed was comfy and the room was clean. Would definitely stay there again.
857942,95670825,2016-08-20,15199768,Sven,This was a great place to stay.  Very quiet.  Close to Pacific Grove's main street and easy parking.  The unit was actually quite large and comfortable.  I will try and stay here again in the future.
857942,96676021,2016-08-23,66091508,Sally,We stayed 3 nights in Virginia's studio. Photos and description are accurate and it was much bigger than we had expected. Feels very safe and quiet neighbourhood and it is a 5 minute walk to lovers point. Great place to stay in the lovely area of Pacific grove. 
857942,104392677,2016-09-26,2543,Michael,"The studio is in a beautiful, charming, quiet neighborhood and very close to Lovers point park. Virginia responded to all of our questions very quickly and overall, we had a wonderful stay. "

857942,115737079,2016-11-26,93766204,Heather,Perfect spot to settle in for a couple nights. Close to restaurants and ocean front hikes (walking a very well groomed trail). We had a blast!
857942,117086658,2016-12-04,63976410,Cari,"The fireplace was a big draw for us, but when asked if we could burn the Duraflame we had bought, the only reply we got was ""there are no tools"".  We decided we didn't need tools and burned the log anyway.  Despite the damper being open, the room filled with duraflame fumes.  That said, it's a nice, clean, practical place.  It has a very useful kitchen and clean bathroom.  The heater can be a little loud when on (a series of metallic creaks and thunks), but it did a good job of warming the place.  It really was a good value for the area and I would stay again.  The walk to Lover's Point was short and really is a perk.  I did not have the pleasure of meeting Virginia, but was able to contact her through Airbnb."
857942,123789866,2016-12-30,46101411,Emily,"This place was perfect for a getaway for two. The studio was clean and included everything we needed, including a ton of towels and kitchen supplies.

857942,190727238,2017-09-04,20596647,J,"Virginia's studio is a clean, pleasant, and above all, very silent place. 
It is so well furnished that you can even prepare a simple meal. 
Personally I enjoyed sipping my coffee and sitting on the terrace. 
If you like walking, you will appreciate comfortable walking distance to the Monterey Aquarium, Lovers' Point or Asilomar beach.  
If you will rent a car, you will easily find the place to park it. 
Another important aspect is that Virginia answers very fast all your questions. 
We had a wonderfully relaxing time staying at Virginia's studio. 
If you look for a silent and a very well situated place in Pacific Grove place, you will definitely appreciate this address."
857942,198536469,2017-09-29,140476290,Christopher,"I stayed here for almost a month.  It exceeded my expectations. It was quiet, convenient, and perfect for a long hideaway.  The host was super-responsive.

Some specifics (and not in priority order).  The shower had lots of water pressure and never ran out of hot water. I never had a problem with on-street parking. The heater was easy to use and quickly heated the apartment.  The kitchen was very well equipped.  I did not do extensive cooking, but it was ideal for simple meals.  The microwave oven was more advanced than any I have used in the past. Simple to use, and effective.  As noted in the listing details, there is no TV is the apartment.  I found that to be one of the property's appeals. The bed was comfortable.  The internet speed was around 12-25 Mbs, fast enough for what I needed.  I would stay here again without a moment's thoughts."

857942,212419594,2017-11-17,140476290,Christopher,This was my second time staying at the studio. I'd stay here again in a heart beat. I found all the other positive reviews to be accurate. Zero problems. An ideal setting in the Monterey bay area.
857942,214375320,2017-11-25,10715251,Simon,Great location just a 5- minute walk to both Lover’s Point and shop/restaurants in Pacific Grove.  Prompt communication and easy check-in/check-out.
857942,222429875,2017-12-29,37366321,Israel,"Great location, close to the shore and Lighthouse Ave. Very clean and spacious space. Easy communication with host. Would definitely recommend."
857942,234431657,2018-02-12,88588992,Cathy,Great location.  Small studio within walking distance to some of Pacific Grove’s best restaurants.  Virginia was very responsive.
857942,246652789,2018-03-25,97037374,Kyle,Amazing location. Next to everything scenic  yet close to the real world. Fantastic food and kind locals.
1031734,4575222,2013-05-13,356624,Michael,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Dan's house in Pacific Heights.  The house is very clean and so well equipped, including great kitchen and a beautiful piano (which unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to play) in the very comfortable living/dining area .  There is also an outdoor garden area with a great hot tub, beautiful seating and grill. A perfect place for a family or couples getaway.  Hope to come back for longer next time we make it to the West coast.  "
1031734,5309718,2013-06-24,358927,Britt,"Dan was in constant communication throughout the booking and planning process and was ALWAYS available via email, phone or text if I ever had any questions. His responsiveness to questions was amazing as well. He provided me with a great list of recommendations in the area, as well as a detailed list of how to use things in the home, as there is a lot to explore. The house is great for 6+ people and there are plenty of spaces to gather or hang out solo. My favorite place to hang was in the courtyard in the awesome wine barrel chairs, in the sun, reading or the large living room space upstairs. The hot tub is a great hangout too! Very conducive to a relaxing week or weekend, and in such an amazing location. Just .8 miles to the beach, and a very short ride into Pacific Grove, Monterrey and Carmel. And, an amazing picturesque drive to Big Sur. Overall, a HIGHLY recommend Dan's place!"
1031734,5974056,2013-07-24,7420378,Serena,"Nice house! So beautiful and comfort house to live in. Hope to stay there again. If we could, we want to live there for a month!
"
1031734,7776122,2013-10-02,8599754,Tanya,"My friends and I had a very short but wonderful stay at Dan's house in Pacific Grove. The house is very clean and so well equipped, including great kitchen( lots of Italian plates and saucepans) and a beautiful piano in the very comfortable living/dining area .We love Dan's books and plenty of classic DVDs, the whole place looks great sense of design. There is also an outdoor garden area with a great hot tub, beautiful seating and grill. A perfect place for a family or couples to stay. Hope to come back for longer next time. Thanks to Dan."
1031734,7978310,2013-10-11,597660,Manny,"Our group of six enjoyed our stay in 
Dan's home.  Dan answered every question promptly and accurately and provided all the information we needed to enjoy the area without being intrusive.  The home is close to Pebble beach in a family oriented neighborhood.  Our favorite part of the home was definitely the outdoor areas, they are spacious and beautifully decorated.  My only caveat is that the beds are on the small side for couples but they are comfortable.  I would not hesitate staying to stay in this comfortable, cozy home again, Dan was a pleasure to deal with."
1031734,8028409,2013-10-13,1149884,Jon,"We had a very pleasant -- albeit too short -- one-night stay at Dan's gorgeous home in Pacific Grove. Dan went above and beyond to communicate before, during and after our visit to ensure our comfort and enjoyment. Even though there is so much great dining and nightlife to explore in Monterey and Carmel, we chose to spend the night hanging out in Dan's home so we could enjoy the jacuzzi, music, views and woodsy vibe. We'll definitely be back next time we visit the area!"
1031734,8227092,2013-10-21,9128392,Laura,It's a beautiful home with lots of space to enjoy company. The outside fireplace and spa were wonderful. The home is very secluded and has all the amenities one could need while on vacation. Really close to Safeway and Trader Joes as well as delicious restaurants. 
1031734,8651883,2013-11-11,7863591,Debbie,"Dan was always available before our stay to answer any questions I had.  He was wonderful to deal with!  Our weekend get-away was truly a treat.  Dan's home is beautiful, warm and welcoming.  We loved having cocktails while enjoying the fire on the outdoor patio.  Pacific Grove is conveniently located near everything.  We visited Monterey (about 10 minutes away) and had a spectacular time.  Dan's furniture is beautiful.  The instructions about his home and what to expect are so detailed.  I truly felt I was thoroughly informed about all details of the house and what to expect.  "
1031734,8760195,2013-11-16,9892016,Lena,Fantastic house! Very clean and nothing is missing! We had a fantastic stay!! Thankyou!!
1031734,8779303,2013-11-18,8013468,Adam,Staying at Dan's place went great. He provided amazing instructions for everything in the house from the entertainment system to the hot tub. I hope to stay here again someday. 
1031734,8902144,2013-11-25,9426544,Ren,"I was here with my wife and some of our friends for the weekend.  The long story short is that the house was awesome.  Here's some key points regarding our experience:

++ The Jacuzzi was awesome!  This was easily the highlight of our weekend, especially with the use of the MP3 player.
++ We were pleasantly surprised at the entertainment room.  This pretty much became our little slumber party area with the amount of airbeds and people sleeping over.
++ The overall decor of the house was simply beautiful.  I had a few friends comment on the Tiffany lighting around the home, and mention the beauty of the outdoor areas, including the rooftop terrace.  The views were spectacular!
++ Dan provided all of the information needed to enjoy our experience.  Any and all questions that we had in mind were answered promptly by Dan via e-mail and from his thorough house manual.

-- The TV in the Entertainment Room was a bit disappointing.  Sure, it was a huge TV compared to the other TVs in the house, but it was an old-school rear projection TV which didn't have an HDMI connection available on the TV nor the surround sound receiver.  Note if you do plan on using it for playing video games or watching something from a laptop, you should have Component cables available.
-- On the checkout day, a lot of us started catching allergies and sneezing a bunch.  Perhaps it was the accumulation of dust with the books and CDs/DVDs around the house, or if it was just our immune systems crashing from the alcohol, or the heater not being warm enough.

With that said, the discouraging points should not deter anyone from considering whether to rent this house or not.  I would definitely rent this place again if I were in the area.  This place is simply beautiful and is worth the experience.  Thank you so much, Dan! :)"
1031734,9828472,2014-01-13,676293,Jonathan,Dan's place is in a great location with some really nice amenities. I think that was the most comfortable bed I've slept in.
1031734,9957080,2014-01-21,5004213,Amelia,"My whole family stayed at Dan's home to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday, and it was a wonderful weekend! The home is beautiful and spacious, and has pretty much everything you might need! Dan has left detailed clear instructions for everything you might need while staying in his home. The 2 free passes for the aquarium are awesome, and the huge wonderful hot tub is the best! 
Be prepared to get a good workout on your leg going up and down the stairs!

1031734,10713247,2014-03-04,10102143,Jenifer,"Adorable and colorful house!  Cozy indoors, with charming back and side yards.  Huge hot tub.  Downstairs has some tight corners, but the upstairs entertainment room is BIG these photos don't do it justice.  We slept 9 girls comfortably between the bedrooms and the home's 2 high-quality air mattresses.  Bathrooms are small but clean.  Tons of kitchenware, towels, and bedding ready for use.  One of our guests needed to use her inhaler each day because it is a pet-friendly home, but everyone else was fine.  The owner was readily available via text/call for any questions during our stay.  We had a truly marvelous weekend!!     "
1031734,10838357,2014-03-10,11377746,Katie,"Nice house, lots of character and centrally located to just about everything. We loved the nice large upstairs entertainment room and beautiful outside lounge chairs and fireplace. 

Would definately recommend for guests who enjoy unique spaces with lots of character that aren't the typical ""model home""  feel. "
1031734,11567774,2014-04-07,1795776,Mike,"Place was great, we had eight people for one night.  The patio by the fireplace was wonderful, hot tub late at night excellent, views and sunset from the upstairs entertainment room and patio were also very good.
The kitchen while small has all of the amenities required.
While nestled in a neighborhood, the place is very private."
1031734,12110454,2014-04-23,11065993,Wade,Great house with an amazing kitchen.  We had an amazing time staying at Dan's house communication with Dan was very good and timely the house was very clean on arrival with enough beds and bedding for our two family's.  Great Hot tub! 
1031734,13064549,2014-05-19,10365460,Penny,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful, eclectic home. The host was very very responsive on all my questions (thanks!). 
First the outside: I rented this home for a college graduation week end. The back yard is phenomenal. It accommodated 20 people beautifully. The garden and grounds (with fountain) are so very beautiful. There are outdoor speakers and a beautiful fireplace. Elegant setting. 

Inside: Beautifully decorated. An elegant beach house. I was amazed at how well stocked the home was with dishes/kitchen items, linens and towels. Amazing. Beautiful furniture and conversation pieces everywhere. The upstairs bonus room, with two comfy blow up mattresses can accommodate many people quite easily and the patio off that room has an incredible ocean view. Nice sunset watching from there. Loved the long window seat with large pillows.

One note (not a complaint, just a note)- the home is a bit compartmentalized. It is nice for separate seating and conversation areas but a bit of a challenge for gathering and seating a large crowd. The living room/ dining room can seat about 8-10 comfortably.  "
1031734,13401727,2014-05-27,3186931,Kyle,"The place is great, and Dan was very accommodating and available if we needed anything. He has put a very nice touch on the place, and I will absolutely stay there again if we go to Monterrey. The bed we slept in was more comfortable than mine at home! Hot tub is great, and the house had everything we need for dinners and entertaining. $15 cab gets you down to Cannery Row. We ended up spending more time at the house than we anticipated, as it was a perfect fit for our group. Nothing but good things to say about this listing!"
1031734,14814042,2014-06-27,2140529,Sean,"Dan was a very responsive host.  The upstairs TV room is huge, and was a great area for relaxing.  The furniture is very nice, so maybe not the best place for kids if they are on the younger side.  Kitchen is small but well-equipped.  Hot tub was amazing- with 3 levels of jets.  "
1031734,14851798,2014-06-28,11102449,Catharina,"A magic garden with unexpected rooms and beautiful flowers everywhere! We really enjoyed our stay on the hillside of Monterey with a very nice jacuzzi and view from the top balcony. The house was very nicely and personally decorated, warm and inviting. We really enjoyed our stay!"
1031734,16467049,2014-07-28,16059202,Michael,"The house was really fun to stay in.  We were quite surprised by the huge bonus room area over the garage and the cozy patio with the fireplace.  Beds were a little dated and somewhat uncomfortable...but not horrible.

Really quiet neighborhood.  I was nice to have several stores nearby for groceries.  

I would definitely consider this home again, but probably for a longer stay."
1031734,16648453,2014-07-31,1313712,Katrina,"Dan was very responsive and all directions and information were clearly displayed in the home. It was the perfect base for our 10 person group and the home was segmented enough that it didn't feel crowded. I loved the landscaping and we certainly made use of the grill. My only complaint would be that the wifi signal was pretty weak, frequently cutting out. "
1031734,16698745,2014-07-31,4244241,Taryn,The reservation was canceled 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1031734,17694847,2014-08-16,18029782,Dov,"We are a family of 9 and found the house to be most suitable. Accommodations were great, as advertised. Located in a quiet neighborhood, very close to a supermarket. Would definitely recommend it.  "
1031734,18295207,2014-08-25,11788109,Chad,"The house was perfect.  We were attending a wedding at Pebble Beach so it was very close to the Lodge and golf courses.  Monterrey and groceries (Trader Joe's and Safeway) were only a couple of blocks away as well.  The house was very cozy with great outdoor spaces to dine near the outdoor fireplace and relax in the hot tub.  The gourmet kitchen with Viking stove was great to cook on and even had LeCrouset pans to use.  Coffee out on the roof deck  looking out over the ocean in the distance was a great way to start the day.  Friends that were paying over $500 a night at Pebble Beach were very jealous of our set up.  I would stay here again in a heart beat.  Beds, pillows and sheets were very comfortable.  "
1031734,21131477,2014-10-12,19194552,Latrice,"The stay at Dan's home was absolutely fabulous! Dan was available to handle questions for our stay, but the details he provided before arrival ensured a perfect transition. Although large, the house is extremely comfortable, cozy and entertaining! They're many fine options to enjoy this beautiful home that has at least seven functioning areas, including an upstairs, outdoor balcony that overlooks the backyard and surrounding neighborhood. Each room including the kitchen, boasts its own style with lots to enjoy! The space is fresh, clean and family friendly!"
1031734,22276085,2014-11-02,9445317,Marc,"We had a good (brief) stay and enjoyed it. The directions were super-detailed and specific, which was helpful. The place was very comfortable and helpfully arranged for guests. Thanks much!"
1031734,23479231,2014-12-01,9727771,Kemal,"The house is amazing, very big and we'll equipped. There is nothing more that we could ask for. The communication with Dan is very fast and simple. He answers all question in a very precise way. Me and my friends had a great time and definitely want to come back soon."
1031734,25164661,2015-01-08,22625777,Brian,"The layout of the home and all the extra features like the fireplaces, piano, spa, gardens and décor made for a wonderfully unique vacation. There was plenty of room for 6 adults and 3 children."
1031734,25310779,2015-01-12,23487431,Pamela,"Our short stay was enjoyable and the weather was unusually warm for January making it even better! We had some difficulty getting in, but with the help of a neighbor and Dan’s handyman we succeeded. Dan was responsive and wanted to make sure all was well. The cozy kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need to cook and make meals. The bedrooms were somewhat small, but nicely furnished. The upstairs den was large and had wonderful views, but unfortunately we did not use it as stairs posed a problem for one of us and resulted in us having to gather in the dining/living room, which was a bit snug. We used the Monterey Aquarium passes Dan graciously provides and enjoyed the sea life adventure"
1031734,25554281,2015-01-19,21534126,Jonathan,The house was great!  The owner was responsive and the view was amazing. If I'm ever back in town I will definitely stay there again!  
1031734,25792839,2015-01-26,24498586,Andrea,"This house is great! My friends and I had a wonderful time staying here. It was really close to downtown Monterey, and still really quiet. The jacuzzi and outdoor fireplaces were the highlights of the stay."

and informative. Great location! The house was perfect for a large group! "
1031734,28599195,2015-03-27,23005127,Rosita,La casa no estaba limpia para lo que nosotros esperábamos. Los cajones de la cocina estaban sucios y había tela de arañas en las lámparas. Los cobertores estaban sucios y manchados. Bajo las camas habían pelos. Las fotografías del jardín corresponderían pero no las de las pieza. El barrio donde estaba ubicada la casa no nos gustó 
1031734,29543748,2015-04-09,25515907,Kristen,"We had a great visit at Dan's home in Pacific Grove.  This was the second leg on our trip ""down the coast"" and we stayed for two nights.  The highlights were the hot tub, the outdoor fire place and the ""man cave"" TV room.  We ended each day with a trip to the hot tub then several hours sitting and chatting near a fire.  The kitchen was very well appointed and stocked with dishes, pots & pans, etc.   Beds were very comfy and had great cozy duvets!  The location was great too as it was just a short drive to downtown Monterey.  
One thing to note especially if you're not from California...given the terrain, quite a bit gets packed into a small square footage footprint and this can be tough to ascertain from photos which seem more linear.  The ""man cave"" great room with the second bathroom is a newer addition and does require climbing a flight of stairs off the garage area.  Not a big deal but something to be aware of.
Last but certainly not least - Dan is a super friendly guy and terrific host.  I was sad at the end of the day that I didn't actually get to meet him in person!  
"
1031734,29811554,2015-04-13,156636,Martha,"Dan was a great host. He was available every time I contacted him and allowed us to check in early. The neighbor hood was great and a good walk to both Asilomar and down town Pacific Grove. Because their were 10 of us, we found the living room and 
kitchen quite small. Although there is a second huge living room for gathering, it's above the garage and separated from the rest of the house. It was also advertised as sleeping 10 people, there were only three beds and two air beds. The outside areas of the house were beautiful, but also broken up and not part of the living areas."
1031734,30751859,2015-04-27,4666074,Lesley,"We had a amazing time at Dan's home. Dan was a wonderful host who was incredibly responsive and easy to coordinate with. We had more than enough room for 8 adults to stay comfortably. We could not have enjoyed the home, bbq, outdoor fireplace, Jacuzzi or roof deck anymore than we did. Can't wait to book the home again for a longer stay. "

1031734,35681905,2015-06-21,12913470,Julian,"Dan made the place feel exactly like home. Everything we needed to cook and clean was in the kitchen. The extra towels and linens were an added bonus. The house guide was very helpful in figuring out how to use the jacuzzi too. Although there are 5 beds listed, I found that there were only 3. However, the couches upstairs we very comfy. I'd definitely stay here again! "
1031734,40730742,2015-08-02,15784224,Lisa,"Dan;

You have made my stay in Pacific Grove a great and wonderful memory.  The beach in your city is better then San Diego!  
I enjoyed the comfort and detail of your home.   We had a large group and we were not in each others way!  It was helpful that you had a high chair!  The fenced in yard was also a great help with the small children.  I'd like to thank you for letting my family enjoy your home.   Seeing the Big Buck in the neighbors yard may us feel at home. "
1031734,41718126,2015-08-09,25354787,Robert,"We had a very nice time.  The house was attractively sited, conveniently located and well maintained.

1031734,43209161,2015-08-18,20419781,Matt,"We has a great experience staying at Dan's place. The house is very conveniently located close to downtown and 17-mile drive. The house was clean with great amenities and perfect for either large or smaller groups, and tge spa and firepit area are perfect for entertaining. Dan provided great communication and was available if need be. I would definitely recommend staying here, and would definately look forward to my next here."
1031734,43800338,2015-08-22,1213284,Blake,My family loved the house and had nothing but great things to say about it.  They also really liked Dan and hearing his story about the house and all the different things in it.
1031734,46327986,2015-09-09,35793067,David,"Great experience staying at Dan's house, quiet, clean and easy access to get in and out. Played two rounds golf at Pebble and Spanish Bay.
Dan is good for communication from start and easy to work with. Dan leave more than what you need in the kitchen for almost anything kind of cooking you want.
We had a great time cooking our hot pot and clean up afterwards.

Good memory!"

1031734,52038686,2015-10-26,9216866,Leslie,"Dan's house had everything we needed (and more) for the weekend. A group of 11 of us were in town for a friend's wedding, and we were all very happy with our accommodations. Dan provided detailed information about the house and it's amenities (we referred to the manual several times throughout the weekend.) The hot tub and outdoor patio area were perfect for drinking our coffee in the morning and catching up with friends. The upstairs tv room held all 11 of us comfortably. In all, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend the house to a friend. "
1031734,53590047,2015-11-10,29537217,Cynthia,The furnishings were beautiful and we were given a warm welcome by our host. We enjoyed the lovely furnishings and the jacuzzi was just what we needed after our half marathon.  Their home is very well-stocked with all of the amenities you would want.  We really liked the warm bathroom floors upstairs too.  Thanks for sharing your home with us.  We had a great time!
1031734,58032567,2015-12-31,3284022,Judith,"The house worked well for a group of six, ranging in age from three to seventy.  "
1031734,61159032,2016-02-01,3058342,Thuy,"Dan has a unique house with a huge entertainment room upstairs and tons of little nooks and crannies. I especially liked the living room nook next to the panel of windows. His book collection is magnificent and I found myself browsing an eclectic array of books he owns. 

The house has a total of 3-4 ""bedrooms"" with 4 actual beds (and tons of other sleeping spaces if you don't mind not sleeping on a bed). One space is a joint space with 2 separate bedrooms in which 1 is located upstairs and the other downstairs, the 2 rooms are separated by an enclosed staircase that leads to one door, so bring your earplugs if you have a loud sleeper in the mix. 

The outdoor garden is really something- the abundance of plants and succulents are refreshing to the eye.  It is dog friendly and has a small doggy door in the kitchen that leads to the enclosed outdoor area. The large jacuzzi is a plus and the kitchen is well stocked with plenty of dishes. Dan was responsive before and after our reservation and provided good instructions for our stay. Thank you!"
1031734,68677958,2016-04-06,17144265,Judy,"Dan's house is lovingly furnished and beautifully appointed!  The kitchen is very well-equipped with excellent quality cookware, serving pieces, utensils and dishes.  We were 7 adults and an almost 2 year old and enjoyed the challenges of exploring all the nooks and crannies and unusual connections between all the rooms and living spaces.  The hot tub was enjoyed by everyone!  The only downside we encountered is that 2 of the bedrooms share the same space and door, and have no privacy from each other.  The house is in a great location with easy access to food stores, restaurants, and everything the area has to offer.  Dan was very responsive and easy to contact."
1031734,69754954,2016-04-13,64814227,Phong,"The house was a masterpiece.    I love the artwork, the landscaping, and the setup of the house.   You can tell Dan is a people pleaser because he willing to spend the money to make the house nice and comfortable for his guest.   The house was beautiful from every angel.   Entertainment room had everything and jacuzzi was awesome!!!i would definitely come back there again if I'm in town or refer friends.  "
1031734,74437060,2016-05-15,1643732,Vanessa,"We had a wonderful time and the house was beautiful! The layout was unique, spacious, and very nicely decorated. We spent most of our time outside, enjoying the fireplace, BBQing, relaxing in the hot tub, and just hanging out. The outdoor space is beautifully landscaped and all of the greenery made it feel very private. It was like we were miles away from it all! All of the beds were super comfortable with lush, high quality bedding, and the space fit our group of 9 very comfortably. The entertainment room was a great space for us all to hang out inside, too.  When we did leave the house, we found that the beach, restaurants & stores were all close by, so it was very convenient. Dan was very responsive from booking to check-out and made our stay very comfortable. Overall, we had a great vacation, and Dan's beautiful home made our reunion that much better! We would definitely stay here again! "
1031734,75368688,2016-05-21,28916201,Jenna,"Stayed at Dan's place for a work retreat (for a small startup). The house was very nice, if a little maze-like. It was fun discovering new rooms as we got settled in. Dan was communicative and nice. It was easy to find and get into the house. Beds were nice and the large space over the garage was great for group discussions. Everyone congratulated me on a great find. Would definitely stay there again!"
1031734,76034849,2016-05-24,57750077,Yuriy,I stayed at Dan's place while on a road trip down the PCH. The place was better in person and everyone was amazed with all the views and amenities of the house. Extremely well kept house and welcoming host. House came equipped with everything you needed for a BBQ which was a welcomed surprise. I will be looking to stay here again on my next trip out.
1031734,77160862,2016-05-30,13648191,Robert,"What a beautifully decorated house.  So spacious with four bedrooms, a large cozy entertainment room with a large big screen TV, kitchen with everything you would need, washer and dryer, outdoor fire place and jacuzzi, beautifully landscaped.  It was far more elegant and spacious than we had expected.  Dan was welcoming, available, and informative.  This is by far the most elegant Airbnb that we have stayed at and the price was very reasonable.  Also there is so much to see and do here.  We would love to come back in the future.  Thank you for helping us have a wonderful experience Dan.
Bob and Kim"
1031734,78444608,2016-06-06,49588963,Apeksha,"This house was so charming and eclectic. The rooms were well furnished, the kitchen was clean and well equipped, and the living room was extremely cozy. The family room upstairs was massive and made for great movie nights. However, my favorite part was the outdoor patio which got the perfect amount of sunlight during the day, and has a fireplace where we made s'mores after dinner at night. 
Overall we had an amazing experience. The hot tub was great but needed a water change soon for sure. And be sure not to play music and talk very loudly in the hot tub very late at night, as the neighbors will complain. Apart from that, it was a wonderful weekend retreat!
Dan was also an incredible host. He was available at all times and quick to respond to any questions or concerns that we had. 
I would go back again to stay for sure!"
1031734,78768573,2016-06-09,69668388,Han,This is a wonderful house!We all like this house. And Dan is nice too.
1031734,79018162,2016-06-10,33135380,Jaime,"Dan's place was great and lived up to the pictures online.  Dan was very attentive, calling and texting me before my stay to ask whether I had any questions about the place.  I would highly recommend staying at Dan's, particularly if you are visiting the central California coast with a group of people.  "
1031734,80669154,2016-06-19,2059895,David,"Dan was a great host and his home was so welcoming. We loved the decor, the furniture, the clean towels and linens and the hot tub too! Thanks for everything, Dan!"
1031734,87954810,2016-07-22,24939771,Kyla,"Dan's place was a dream! He was an absolute pleasure to work with, and even called me personally to make sure everything was in order for our stay. Dan has a beautiful and unique home with plenty of space for a big group, amazing views, and all the amenities you could dream of. We had a great stay and would stay there again in a second!"
1031734,92372914,2016-08-08,72879486,Michael,We felt welcome.  For 12 people the house was very tight.  The furnishings were upscale.  But the accommodations were tight.  Only two batherooms and no table big enough for 12 people.
1031734,94419289,2016-08-15,17179883,David,"Dan's house in Pacific Grove is unique, fascinating, and well-located in a popular vacation spot between Monterey and Pebble Beach and quite close to Carmel. It was the perfect size for our group of 6 adults, and the photos he provides barely do justice to its many amenities and features. 

The weather was cool and foggy during most of our stay, so we didn't get to take full advantage of the several outdoor areas adjacent to the house, although the spa hot tub felt wonderful after a day at the Monterey Aquarium.

The house is easy to reach from Highway 1, there's a Safeway and Trader Joe's nearby, and downtown Pacific Grove is delightful with several nice restaurants and far fewer tourists than Monterey."
1031734,96085014,2016-08-21,79744877,Obayda,Very cool house. Everything was clean and the host really knew how to make us feel welcome! 
1031734,96971839,2016-08-25,81330356,Robert,Fresh flowers were a very nice touch
1031734,97918323,2016-08-28,53439187,Heather,"This home in Monterey is so special and relaxing! Our family stayed here during a wedding weekend and we were so happy. It is only minutes from Cannery Row and the main area, a very convenient easy drive. Dan is very quick to respond to any emails and very nice. We highly recommend staying here. Loved it!"
1031734,99783825,2016-09-05,26231220,Jackie,Wonderful experience! Dan was quick to answer any questions and the home was beautiful. Patio was great for our group dinner. Highly recommended.
1031734,100506868,2016-09-09,33165554,Catherine,Dan's place was a perfect spot to spend a relaxing evening before heading to Big Sur.  The kitchen was well appointed and upstairs entertainment room was spacious.  The beds were super comfortable.  Thanks so much for hosting us!
1031734,101902887,2016-09-15,45814206,Bonnie,It was comfortable and convenient with instructions on all the amenities. There was a grocery store very close by and everything was extremely clean. 
1031734,106337317,2016-10-05,94872035,玮玮,"房子超级棒,只可惜停留的时间太少,应该多住2天。"
1031734,109511101,2016-10-22,1257973,Danielle & Mike,Our stay at Dan's place was great! His home was more than accommodating. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. His house was close to everything we had planned for our stay and the views were great! I would definitely recommend Dan's place :) 
1031734,111365103,2016-10-30,39521533,Jung,"Loved the high ceilings in the great room, surround sound, excellent WiFi, the backyard patio with beautiful brick fireplace, and great furniture - just to name a few of the highlights. It's close to grocery stores, bakeries, restaurants and pretty much everything to make it a fun, relaxing weekend with 8 ppl to celebrate my birthday. Dan was super nice, responded quickly, and was very thorough with information about the home!"
1031734,111536227,2016-10-31,33772055,Brian,"Very comfortable spot.  We were just passing through and had a great time.
Peaceful exterior and all around easy experience."
1031734,112849456,2016-11-08,47541047,Karin,Lovely home - a very special place.  We enjoyed our stay tremendously.  
1031734,113921534,2016-11-14,8187008,Michael,"Great place with plenty of space for our group of 10. Little bit of a funky layout in the house... Going through bedrooms to get to other bedrooms, but worked for us because we are all friends. We were staying there for the big sur half marathon and it was perfect (especially the hot tub to relax). Good location (less than 10 minute drive to downtown Monterey). Wish the check-out could have been later since we were really rushed to shower after our race, but that expectation was set, so no fault of dans."
1031734,114090158,2016-11-15,71256895,Linda,"Description of place was exact, but pictures didn't do it justice. "
1031734,117088953,2016-12-04,7114311,Brianna,Our stay was everything and more! Would definitely suggest this listing to anyone wanting to stay in the area!
1031734,120336656,2016-12-09,22827805,Jamie,"Awesome place!  A little quirky, which we loved! Would be a great place to bring your friends to watch the Superbowl, or other big game in the awesome bonus room.  And pet friendly!"
1031734,120538955,2016-12-10,7528792,Hannah,Dan was fantastic. Eager to accommodate our group and our changing plans. Very dedicated to a great guest experience and his place is beautiful!
1031734,120781619,2016-12-11,27284404,Lily,Great place!! Dan was very responsive and everything went very smoothly. 
1031734,121388528,2016-12-16,2791564,Khakanang,I'm so happy to stay here. Also the spa jacuzzi is very cool and a lot of function. Everyone love it and Dan is very welcoming and helpful . I would recommend to stay in his house :) thx
1031734,121956737,2016-12-20,7747281,Leanne & Jim,"A group of seven adults stayed for 3 nights at Dan's lovely property. It was a wonderful experience. The house is filled with lovely details, you were continually discovering something new, fantastic outdoor spaces, and a great kitchen. We were there to work, at least part of the time, and the large spaces fulfilled our needs. The location was central and easy to find. Dan was very thoughtful and always available. I highly recommend staying with him. "
1031734,122992672,2016-12-26,9554864,Desiree,Dan's place is unique and fits perfectly with the Pacific Grove ambiance. The Family room over the garage was huge and acommodated my family for the holidays. The hot tub was great with the rainy weather and the kitchen has every convenience. The small private patios off the bedroom and larger one with the outdoor fireplace is great during mild weather. The fireplace worked well and was appreciated during our rainy days.
1031734,126180213,2017-01-09,9806994,Shannan,"This is a lovely home that has been well cared for and carefully curated. The living rooms, kitchen and outdoor spaces are outstanding. The driveway is steep and there are some uneven surfaces, which made things tough for our mobility impaired friends. Otherwise it was really great."
1031734,131118833,2017-02-10,55800817,Dan And Michelle,"It's a wonderful place to stay, very centrally located, and great for our group. We all had our our room!"
1031734,131600477,2017-02-12,51780300,Mike,Our group of 8 thoroughly enjoyed this unique PG location. It was convenient and central to everything. Thank you! 
1031734,131792382,2017-02-13,25143677,Gayle,Dan was a very responsive and flexible host who made sure our stay was enjoyable.  The outdoor space was great for enjoying time with family.
1031734,133258740,2017-02-21,1308646,Felita,"Warm inviting cozy home. Lots of special touches! 

Due to weather issues, we lost power one of the days, but things worked out fine. 

Dan is very communicative. His cleaning staff arrived early Monday morning, around 9:30am to get laundry started. 

We were doing laundry from the day behind to ensure towels were washed and dried. 

Another bathroom/toilet would be ideal, but otherwise, a very cozy family home. 

Our stay was very rainy and cold and windy so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor spaces much. The hot tub one night was great. 

Thank you for providing a lovely safe home!

Oh and there were DEER on the street... so fun! 

It's also very close to the entrance of the 17 mile entrance. So many deer! Immersed in beautiful nature!!"
1031734,134319550,2017-02-26,106439008,Carly,Everything was exactly how it was put out to be. Dan was great with communication when it came to everything about the house. Beautiful place to stay
1031734,135347435,2017-03-04,14000665,Katherine,"The house is absolutely special and the host was incredibly gracious. We had a check-in mishap that was a little hectic, since Dan thought we were checking in the following day. But he made a tremendous effort to get the house ready within the hour after we arrived, and gifted us a bottle of wine to make up for it. He was quick to respond if we had any questions regarding the sound system or kitchen, and is a very sweet and personable person. In a way, the check-in mishap was a blessing in disguise, since he could be there to walk us through the house and show us the nice details that we might have otherwise overlooked. The house is beautiful, and 8 women fit comfortably for a nice girls weekend. We took full advantage of the well-stocked kitchen, big open living upstairs room and backyard. I only wish we could've stayed longer! I will definitely be booking the house again for another family get-together in the future. "
1031734,137217247,2017-03-13,30434126,Candace,Beautiful home that was central to everything in the Monterey area. House equipped with all necessities. Enjoyed the outdoor patio with the surround sound and fire pit! Awesome home! 
1031734,137480353,2017-03-15,119554433,Dingyi,The house is super awesome! Had a great time during staying.
1031734,139304035,2017-03-24,25117371,Zhang,"The house was really fantastic with oceans of CDs and fabulous Bose speaker. If you a fan of Jacuzzi, this was the right place to go !!! Highly recommended the comfy but also artistic house!"
1031734,141057036,2017-04-02,71599783,Mike,"The 7 adults, toddler and dog in our party had a fantastic week long stay at Dan's place. The large family room upstairs was prefect for relaxing in the evening and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals for everybody. The location is quiet but with lots of amenities within very easy reach. Dan was very responsive in all communications and was a great host. "
1031734,141765506,2017-04-04,14051,Kelly,"We had a great, but short stay at Dan's place. The house was really unique and we enjoyed all of the outdoor areas. We didn't utilize all of the features, but the kitchen is fully equipped, and the house is well appointed. Dan was easy to communicate with and the location is really central."
1031734,143416039,2017-04-11,25801649,Tilly,"The house was perfect for our needs. I was slightly confused by the sleeping arrangements as I thought more bedrooms were available (which may have been my mis-reading) but it didn't really deter any of us. The house was perfect location wise and Monterey is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been! The hot tub proved popular with everybody as well and was a great base for my brother in laws wedding which is the reason for our stay! It was also very helpful having laundry facilities etc so we could keep on top of towels etc throughout our stay. Thank you also for the aquarium passes, I would highly recommend going as not only is the aquarium amazing the views are absolutely spectacular. "
1031734,148873152,2017-05-01,22482566,Erik,Dan has a beautiful house that has plenty of space. The family room upstairs is spacious and has plenty of space.  The jacuzzi was very comfortable and worked perfectly!  Great place to stay!
1031734,154705553,2017-05-25,127612687,Charmaine,We had a wonderful stay at Dan's comfortable and very well-appointed house. Love the location - quiet but central to everything. We loved all the attention to detail in the house and the outdoor spaces. It was a perfect retreat for a small family with a baby and dog. Dan was super responsive to any questions. Thank you for everything!! 
1031734,156103539,2017-05-29,13417476,Vanessa,Beautiful home! Great host! 
1031734,159696550,2017-06-11,41167053,Andrew,Fantastic house with beautiful outdoor spaces and amenities. Highly recommended!
1031734,161798401,2017-06-18,98056451,Tonya,"This home was exactly as described, so comfortable for my whole family. The outdoor spaces were wonderful. Minutes from everything we needed, the beaches, shops, entertainment. We absolutely fell in love with Monterey and look forward to our next trip to this great town and home!"
1031734,162369468,2017-06-20,94040949,Roger,Our family of seven stayed at Dan’s place for one night during our one week West Coast Adventure. It’s a beautiful house and it’s very close to many restaurants and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was a wonderful place to hang out and chill from a long day drive. Dan’s detailed instructions were extremely helpful and he was also easily accessible if we had any questions. We would definitely recommend Dan’s house if you are considering visiting the Monterey Bay area.
1031734,168967655,2017-07-10,77186852,Hunter,"Dans place is awesome I would definitely recommend staying here, if I had any questions he was very quick to respond and help"
1031734,171510224,2017-07-17,5007743,Anastasia,"Dan's place is excellent in all areas. We had a large group and filled all the beds, and still had plenty of space in the enchanting and gorgeous house. There really is an ocean view and the space is perfect for gathering friends together in the upper living room. Small details like special ""starry night"" lighting in a room with a great piano for us to play added to the experience. The state of the house was very high quality as described and the host was responsive. Throughout the house there were small instructional sighs explaining how to use various light switches, where to find the towels, etc - this level of attention to detail was found throughout the home. We highly recommend!"
1031734,171731830,2017-07-18,103828394,Wenlu,Very quiet place for big family. There is a piano in room which makes it very elegant. Dan is very nice and gave us very clear direction to get into the house.
1031734,174021263,2017-07-24,100752026,Laura,"While Dans place was nice, it was fairly dated and the kitchen has absolutely no pantry items or condiments for cooking anything. You must buy everything if you want to cook at home.

Our family did enjoy the outside firepit and hot tub and it's location next to pebble beach is perfect if you are visiting that area!"
1031734,174407911,2017-07-25,141956756,Seethim,Beautiful home in a great location! My family of 6 and two dogs had a wonderful time relaxing with plenty of room to spread out.
1031734,174958021,2017-07-27,94520081,David,A beautiful home in a lovely residential area. Pacific Grove is lovely & the location is only a 5 minute drive to Monterey. The house had everything you could think of.  The space in the upstairs lounge is amazing.  The jacuzzi is fantastic. Overall a great place to stay.
1031734,176707326,2017-07-31,71282719,Jo Ellen,We had a group of 4 couples celebrating a 60th birthday.  We had a super time staying here.  It was perfect with 4 queen beds.  We enjoyed the hot tub and the outdoor fireplace!  Very convenient to grocery stores and places to eat too.  We very able to make meals and enjoy them together around the large table.  Would highly recommend consideration of Dan's place for your future stays.
1031734,185382526,2017-08-21,3949194,Eric,Dan is simply fantastic. Very communicative and the house met our needs perfectly. The location is great and the house is everything that is advertised and more.
1031734,186865127,2017-08-25,127306727,Rensheng,"大家入住后感觉非常非常满意,只是行程有限,否则大家都想再住几天!"
1031734,190504731,2017-09-04,23230412,Karen,"Special features: Beautiful design, excellent kitchen appliances, and a pretty, serene outdoor space to enjoy breakfast, conversation, or a good read.  Hot tub and sunset view from the top leek also are lovely."
1031734,191793541,2017-09-08,44411771,Brian,"If you love quaint, quiet homes and garden patios this is the place for you! Our family really enjoyed the outside lights, patio and outdoor fireplace. We topped the last night off by watching a fire while enjoying a bottle of wine."
1031734,196251021,2017-09-22,28275082,Roger,"This is a unique, ""wild"" house. Ocean views are nice, hot tub is great, the ""media"" room with huge screen tv, piano and ample seating was fantastic. Short car ride to most activities in Monterey and Carmel. The layout, patios, fireplaces and decorating were a feast for the senses. If you stay here you will not be disappointed."
1031734,196619774,2017-09-23,24314082,小桃,"在靠近17mile 的位置,一共四张大床,小而精致,除了价格稍贵,其他挺好的。
nearby the 17mile,so quite, enjoy stay in the house"
1031734,198755663,2017-09-30,54220641,Miki,Wonderful location and perfect access to the surrounding areas. The house itself is fantastic and well stocked in the way of cooking essentials. The hot tub is nice as well as the outside courtyard area for sitting and relaxing. No complaints whatsoever and would absolutely stay there again
1031734,200267074,2017-10-04,63411578,Shannon,"We very much enjoyed the home! I wish that we had more time to spend there. His house manual was excellent, with lots of details about the house and recommendations for attractions."
1031734,203006924,2017-10-13,101739373,Beth,"We were a group of 8, planning to spend 3 days touring the Sonoma/Napa area.  One day before our trip, the devastating fires started.  We needed to completely rebook our trip at the last minute.  We were thankful for find this wonderful property in the Carmel/Monterey area.

The host, Dan, was very helpful and quick to reply to any questions.  The home was exactly as pictured.  It is a little quirky in layout, but we found that to be charming. We had everything we could possibly need, as we were planning to cook most of our meals at the house.  Blenders, multiple styles of coffee makers, every pan/pot/utensil you could ever need when cooking for a large group.

There were fresh flowers on the table, hot tub (which we didn't use), and a beautiful outdoor patio area with outdoor fireplace.  The exterior is beautifully lit.  There is a courtyard with a bubbling fountain and beautiful plantings.

Our only notes for others when booking this property is that the bathroom set up is a bit awkward for a large group.  There is one bathroom for the main house where the four bedrooms are located.  One of the bedrooms is shared - one bed up and one at the base of a curved staircase.  Since the person staying in the upper bedroom needs to come down the stairs to use the bathroom, there is less privacy with this set up.  It wasn't a problem for us...just good to know.

Also, the second bathroom is located next to the great room.  We actually had trouble finding this space initially.  You access it by going out into the garage, then through a door that leads to the outside.  A staircase takes you up (the space is the upper level of the garage).  The great room has a 70"" TV.  It was a wonderful space for all 8 of us to comfortably relax at the end of the day.

We really enjoyed our stay here.  Close to nearby attractions (5-10 minutes from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Carmel, etc.).  The host even provides two free passes to the Aquarium - which was wonderful since it costs $50 per person normally!  Thank you, Dan!"
1031734,205014801,2017-10-20,143381944,Shawn,"Four couples stayed at Dan's place for the beginning of a long couples weekend. Booking and working out details before our stay was very easy and we we immediately impressed by Dan's attention to detail and mission to provide a great experience. My husband and I were the first to arrive and since we would not have time as a group to visit the Aquarium, Dan let us get two complimentary tickets prior to check in so we had something fun to do while we waited for our group. When we checked in, we drew straws for bedrooms and no one was disappointed. We got the smallest room, but the bed was so comfortable and cozy and was off the patio, so its size only mattered when we unpacked our suitcase. We spent as much time as we could on the patio, we had a fire going while we drank wine and played games both nights of our stay. It really is a magical space, especially at night. We didn't cook while we were there but the house has everything you would need if you did. We had happy hour charcuterie and were able to find platters, cheese knives, appetizer plates and all the wine glasses we needed. All and all a great place to stay, good gathering places and enough private areas if someone needs some downtime."
1031734,206089857,2017-10-23,16311513,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed our stay at this location. We were 4 moms getting away for our 3rd Annual Mamma’s Weekend! The place had everything you need (the kitchen is SO STOCKED), it’s very cozy and has unique design. The upstairs room is fantastic to relax and hangout. The outdoor area is private and like a secret oasis. You forget you’re in a neighborhood, it feels more like the forrest. If we stayed in the same place every year, we’d be back in a heartbeat!"
1031734,207771707,2017-10-29,17738018,Rebecca,"I would highly recommend Dan's place for groups coming in to Carmel/Monterey for the weekend!  The house is really interesting, with a unique layout, personal touches, and beautiful views.  It is conveniently located next to a main road that takes you straight to both Carmel and Monterey.  There were several issues with additional guests joining our group at the last minute, and Dan was very accommodating.  My aunt was able to bring her dog after confirming that the dog was taking flea medication and paying a small fee. 
 The jacuzzi seemed really new and felt clean.  There was an issue with the shower draining slowly, and it was addressed quickly and immediately.  Overall a great experience."
1031734,211265342,2017-11-12,6780579,Gregory,"Great place to stay.  We had 7 adults staying for the Monterey Half Marathon and it worked out great.  Plenty of space,  dishes, towels etc.   Great kitchen, we cooked in for both dinners with no problems.  Close to everything, but not walking distance.  Quiet residential neighborhood."
1031734,216423133,2017-12-03,9731212,Christy,"Dan's house was amazing! I rented it for the weekend for myself and a few best girlfriends to ring in my 40th. House is large, comfy, and well-equiped. Easy to access monterey, carmel, pt lobos. Backyard is huge with a great fireplace and was the perfect venue for a few of my family members to join us for dinner sat night. Highly recommended tental, thank you!"
1031734,218745747,2017-12-14,6691985,Mick,We loved our stay at Dan’s very special house. Perfect for us and the kids - who loved the jacuzzi and the big TV room.
1031734,219538469,2017-12-17,158061569,Ann,A convenient and fun home in great location. Lots of comfortable space inside and out.
1031734,223818889,2018-01-01,1917585,Robert,"My wife and I stayed at Dan's place in Pacific Grove over the 2017-2018 New Year. It's a large home with beautiful, very private outdoor spaces and an upstairs great room with a terrific view. If you enjoy cooking, there's a well-stocked (with cookware and equipment) kitchen and a gourmet oven. Dan phoned day-of to ensure we had checked in and everything was as it should be. There's also a terrific, detailed guide to the home so nothing will go unanswered. The location is a two minute drive from several grocery stores and a five minute drive from the heart of Monterey. We would definitely stay here again!"
1031734,228228344,2018-01-18,44661782,John,"Thanks for making our 3-day Monterey golfing trip an excellent one, Dan. We loved your upstairs great room with the huge high def TV...it was perfect for watching the Warriors win...again! The hot tub was perfect for relaxing and rejuvenating our aging bones after golf, and your house was extraordinarily well-equipped, with everything we could possibly need. We definitely put the Weber grill to good use, including some Alaskan halibut caught by one of our guys. It is a very interesting and highly functional floor plan, with Pacific Grove flair!"
1031734,230032207,2018-01-26,160080368,Joni,"Dan gets 5 stars for being a wonderful and helpful host. The house is a gem, in a quiet neighborhood with lovely spaces inside and out. The outdoor areas were very private; the large entertainment room and the rooftop patio were bonuses. It was the perfect place for our family of 6 adults to relax and enjoy. It's also very close to Trader Joe's, a great local bakery and some nice restaurants including pizza. The kitchen is well-stocked with cookware and serveware. Do be prepared to wash your bed linens."
1031734,236566914,2018-02-19,17153803,Jesse,"Dan was a wonderful host, he responded quickly to all our communications and requests. The home was a great place for my family. We cooked every night in the kitchen and enjoyed the uniqueness of the home and yard. The hot tub is huge and we loved it. Thanks for letting us stay in your home."
1031734,237124449,2018-02-21,40809907,Connie,"Dan’s place was phenomenal. The jacuzzi, grill, and upstairs hang out room was perfect for our large group! Location was terrific too, close to downtown but secluded as well. My only suggestion would be to bring your own firewood for the outdoor firepit. Overall loved our experience and would recommend to friends!"
1031734,237938793,2018-02-24,22308780,Angelique,A beautiful home and an exceptional host. Loved our stay!
1031734,238483269,2018-02-25,95366705,Vannessa,Dan's home is magnificent! The upstairs room has a view of the ocean. The upstairs family room was a wonderful place to gather and make memories.  My family and I loved staying here and would love to go back for our annual trip to Lovers Point which is about 7 minutes from the house.
1031734,240371477,2018-03-04,22610796,David,"Dans home is incredible...beautiful spaces...lovely outdoor areas...
Well thought out kitchen with all a cook would want...

Hot tub fabulous and bed sublime!

Great for large groups. Dan is an amazing owner...we had questions which he answered immediately...kind and caring.

Also easy to get to everything...and aquarium passes.

Highly recommend!!!"
1031734,242338696,2018-03-11,37614439,LilyAnn,Unique house that accommodated our large group! We had a great time enjoying the hot tub and relaxing in this quiet neighborhood. Great views from the roof top porch were a plus!
1031734,243680079,2018-03-16,1694093,Karrie,"Really cool place. Walking distance to a great beach with plenty of room and a boardwalk path next to golf course. Also easy quick access to multiple forested running trails and 17-Mile Drive. 

Nice sleepy community 15 mins from Monterey if you’re looking for more. 

Host is incredibly responsive, thoughtful, and cares about making guests happy.

Highly recommend."
1031734,246630381,2018-03-25,69003240,Amanda,"We absolutely loved our time here. This place had gorgeous decor and furniture but it was still comfortable and easy to feel at home. There were plenty of spices/condiments/everything you'd need in the kitchen. The layout of the house is funky in the best way, it's spacious and has plenty of hangout spots. We had a group of 7 and just wanted to hang out at this fantastic house all weekend! The huge hot tub under the stars was perfection and the outdoor fireplace was gorgeous. I'd definitely go back!"
1031734,247215213,2018-03-27,36619384,Jackie,"This house is very unique and eclectic - just right for a trip to this area. The house had everything we needed and was perfect for our group. We enjoyed it very much and will definitely stay again, especially for the rooftop views!"
1031734,249764184,2018-04-02,127235660,Sandy,"Is a beautiful property, very relaxing and very quiet. We used the aquarium passes and had a great time there also! The outdoor fireplace was wonderful and the ""kids"" (20-30 yo) loved the hot tub! Close to everything, but feels like home"
1031734,251895549,2018-04-08,75237986,Jill,"Dan house is centrally located. If you plan on using fireplace, please bring wood. It's great to have the stores so close."
1031734,253496033,2018-04-14,55603959,Kimberly,House was amazing and conveniently located to Monterey Pebble Beach Carmel and pacific Grove.
1031734,254075737,2018-04-15,116090911,Kristina,"Dan is really quick at responding, which I love!  He is also very accommodating as I was looking for a place to stay in Monterey Bay that would fit my entire family (8 adults & 1 infant) to celebrate my mom's 70th birthday.  He usually has a 2 night minimum requirement on weekends, but I sent him a message and he agreed to let us stay for just 1 night.  

The house itself is super interesting.  My mom compared it to the Winchester Mystery House because she had so much fun exploring the house and finding out where all the doors led.  There were plenty of beds plus the pull-out couch in the entertainment room above the garage so everyone got their own space.  The only thing we would've changed is maybe an extra bathroom, but we knew there were only two bathrooms before we got there.  We just had to allot a little extra time for everyone to have bathroom time!

We only wish we could've stayed longer.  One night was too short since check-in is at 4pm and we had to check-out by 11am.  We would definitely come back and stay longer to truly enjoy Dan's house and the beautiful surrounding areas!"
1721177,7935911,2013-10-08,9151363,Sean,"My family and I had a wonderful stay in this unit. The unit is very well kept and clean, with a great unobstructed view of the Bay, right across the road from the beach. The hostess was very helpful and even provided information on local amenities and attractions. Recommended!"
1721177,8164511,2013-10-18,2062755,Melanie,"Barb is a wonderful person and concerned host.

The place is perfect with stunning views...

We shall definitely be staying there again when we revisit the wonderful Monterey Bay aquarium

Thanks Barb"
1721177,8245525,2013-10-21,9362113,Huseni,"Barbara is a wonderful host and clearly had put in lot of thought and effort to ensure we had a memorable experience.  The views were fabulous and the location of the town home is so perfect.....steps away from the water yet close to dining, groceries etc ! We plan to be back!"
1721177,8557688,2013-11-04,9769957,George,The place was lovely and Barb was a treat to work with. A+++ would stay again!
1721177,8680800,2013-11-11,9842822,Stephanie,"Barb was a wonderful host.  She was responsive, informative and helpful before and throughout the stay.  She was quick to respond to my inquiry and questions.  Once the reservation was confirmed, she provided all kinds of local information and recommendations and specific instructions for the condo.  And, on the day of, she checked that we had found the parking and condo easily and that everything was in order. Everything was perfect, but if there had been any problems, I knew that Barb was just a quick call or text message away. 

The place was beautiful and just as described.  Amazing views and a wonderful place to spend a special weekend. 

Thank you Barb!"
1721177,8758771,2013-11-16,9777750,Wind,"Barbara is a very warm and patient host. Her apartment is so nice and clean. Two friends,my wife Vicky and myself all love this place and have a very good time in that lovely room. Sitting around the dining-table to enjoy great California fruit breakfast and looking outside breath-taking ocean view is a wonderful experience. Barbara's place is very close to the amazing 17mile drive. I should come back one day with more family members."
1721177,8901317,2013-11-25,4026711,Doug,"The views morning to night from this apartment are amazing. It is a corner unit so you get the sunrise over Monterrey Bay  which is wonderful. The unit is very  nicely appointed, really  everything you would want. The location is very convenient for walking to town and overlooking the beach so hard to imagine a better location. Barb was very  helpful and responsive to our calls and accommodating when we asked abut checking out late.  We look forward to returning in the future!"
1721177,9181253,2013-12-11,6761933,Jessica,"An incredible view, gorgeous spacious flat with a well equipped kitchen, I loved cooking whilst taking in the views. Barbara was so helpful and responded to any questions immediately. Would definitely recommend and hope to be back"
1721177,9461525,2013-12-30,9081079,Tania,"My family had a great time over the holiday in PG!  The townhouse i relaxing and lovely, we definately want to make return trips. "
1721177,10523929,2014-02-23,9605681,Lee,"We had a great stay at Barbs place. The location was perfect for family. Good food, aquarium, beach all easy walking distance. We parked the car and didn't use it again until we left. The apartment is well cared for, has great views and is very comfortable. We look forward to going back."
1721177,10887542,2014-03-11,12431423,Chelsey,"If you are even remotely debating traveling to Pacific Grove, do yourself a favor and just book Barb's townhome already! From the moment we pulled up we were in love! the views alone are amazing and the townhome is just icing on the cake. We stayed for 3 nights and I wish we would have stayed for a full week! The area has so much to do and we tried some of Barbs recommendations for places to eat and loved all of them! She was so accommodating and willing to answer any questions we had during our stay! Definitely will be going back again!!"
1721177,11204952,2014-03-24,7808591,Mark,"Barb has a beautiful beach condo & was extremely welcoming, responsive and accommodating.  We biked the 17 mile drive from Monterey to Carmel - which was one of the highlights from the trip."
1721177,11494087,2014-04-05,3858089,Stephanie,"This townhome is just lovely.  Beautiful view, beautiful apartment.  Barb's suggestions for restaurants etc were all spot-on.  Only wish there were some binoculars on hand to see the otters and harber seals more clearly from the balcony!"
1721177,11548663,2014-04-07,4671550,Audrey,We had a wonderful weekend at Lover's Point.  The views from the condo are amazing and the location can't be matched.  It's an easy walk to pretty much anything.  The condo was very clean and well kept and equipped.  Barbara was extremely helpful and accommodating.  We hope to go back soon.
1721177,11623882,2014-04-09,6235158,Marilyn,"Barb's townhome was a wonderful place to enjoy the beauty of the Monterey area.  The views were amazing, steps to the beach walk, close to everything needed for a relaxing vacation.  Barb was very willing to work with us and our schedule.  We will definitely look for Barb's listing next time we travel to Monterey."
1721177,11677095,2014-04-11,5077519,Rialda,"Best location in Pacific Grove, wonderful apt and great host! Me and my family really enjoyed our stay there! 3 "
1721177,11702623,2014-04-12,9863155,铮,Barb is a terrific host. Her place is well equipped with perfect ocean view just like the pictures shown. She communicated very promptly with us about check-in process and gave us detailed guides on where to go around. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely refer to others about our experiences here.
1721177,11836228,2014-04-16,10517925,Alex & Lisa,This apartment is fantastic as is Barbara's lovely hospitality. Highly Recommend!
1721177,11915673,2014-04-19,4704582,John,"This is a beautifully presented apartment in a stunning prime location in this magnificent part of the world. Everything works as stated. Views are amazing. Right in front is a hire shop for bikes, kayaks and stand up paddle boards etc. Barb was easy to contact and very helpful in making arrangements around the keys. This really is the place to stay and we will be back."
1721177,12760577,2014-05-10,7947121,Osman,"Our family rented this lovely townhome and the villa across the street. Both properties exceeded our expectations, and Barb was an extremely thoughtful and considerate host.  "
1721177,12937956,2014-05-14,1470914,Garrett,"Romantic spot; good calm beach across the street for the kids.  Great location.  Loved watching the boats and wildlife (including some humpbacks).

There's just not much else to put into words.  You have to experience it.  Recommended."
1721177,13476602,2014-05-28,10102011,Albert,"Barb is very nice and welcoming. Great communication, fast responses, and very accommodating towards requests. Her Ocean view property is simply breathtaking and worth every penny of it. I would very much love to come back given the opportunity, great host!"
1721177,13963355,2014-06-09,6416424,Chanh,"Very clean apartment with great views of the beach and ocean.  Apt is on a main street, but it was not very noisy during our stay.  The bike and kayak rentals being just across the street were a great bonus.  The water was too cold for the kids to swim when we went (we had been in the Caribbean two weeks earlier), but they had tons of fun nonetheless.  We would definitely rent this place again."
1721177,14154071,2014-06-13,3006724,Detlev,"It was a wonderful stay at Barb's place - we really enjoyed it! Her app is beautiful with everything you wish for a relaxing vacation! Super clean, beautiful interior, close to little downtown, the beach and nature in front of the door. Sitting at the dining table with a wonderful view on the ocean and some seals passing by ... We would love to come back! "
1721177,14917354,2014-06-29,15783210,John,Great location.  Great home - very comforabke for our family of 5.  Great hospitality from Barb. 
1721177,15070500,2014-07-01,8872029,Rebecca,"Barb's home was a perfect place for our family vacation. The pictures are very accurate - the oceanfront views were breathtaking, and the home itself was clean, cozy, and well cared for. The location is also fantastic. Pacific Grove is a picturesque little town, and very close to Monterey (we unintentionally ran right into the middle of the downtown area, along the convenient shoreline running/biking path across the street from the property). Barb herself was great to communicate with. She gave us very thorough instructions, and was highly responsive throughout the weekend. Thanks for a great Airbnb experience!"
1721177,15319663,2014-07-07,8295496,Ruth,"GORGEOUS! This is a stunning place to stay, everything that Barbara promised - beautifully furnished, really comfortable, thoughtfully stocked with kit and in the most beautiful location - the best Airbnb we've been in and thoroughly recommended!"
1721177,15671960,2014-07-14,1337315,Jim,"This place is lovely and very clean. The view of the bay and lover's point is amazing. The kitchen is elegant and well-equipped - we made amazing breakfasts at home.  It was fun to watch the kayakers and beach-goers from the balcony.  I wish I'd brought a bicycle/running shoes/rollerblades for exercise because the oceanfront trail across the street looks fun.  We had no issues communicating with Barbara, and all the instructions were clear and simple."
1721177,16479289,2014-07-28,7687917,Jessica,"Great apartment!!  Super clean and cozy!  You cannot beat the view!  It's incredible.  Literally right across the street from Lovers Pt.  The location is insane.  Unfortunately we actually didn't get to spend much time in the apartment this time, so i look forward to coming back and actually really enjoying the space.  Barb was great! Was avail to answer any questions and give advice on the area!  With the  price of the shabby hotels in the vicinity of the apartment, it really makes so much more sense to stay in a beautiful space with a beautiful view.  THANKS!"
1721177,16880787,2014-08-04,11047664,Matt,"What a perfect place to stay! The location was great. Lovely views to wake up to, a quick hop over the road for a dip in the sea and a lovely walk to the aquarium, Cannery Row and Fisherman's Wharf. 
The apartment provided everything we needed and Barbara was a great host. Would definitely stay here again."
1721177,17574753,2014-08-14,18013271,Christin,"En underbar lägenhet, med fantastisk vy över Pacific Grove. Nära till strand, vackra promenadstråk, affärer och resturanger. 
Vi fick uppleva solnedgång på Lovers Point, månsken från balkongen och soluppgång från sovrummet. Det var så fint!
Barbara är en fantastisk hyresvärd allt var perfekt i lägenheten. Vi fick bra tips om restauranger m.m. och hade bra mailkontakt med henne.
Vi var 6 personer som hade en toppen vistelse i Pacific Grove. Vi hade gärna stannat fler nätter. Vi kan varmt rekommendera Barbara som värd och hennes förtjusande  lägenhet."
1721177,18675225,2014-08-30,2929634,Cara,"The views are fabulous, absolutely splendid! But no one lives in this house and it is void of any conveniences such as pepper (the grinder was empty), aluminum foil, napkins, or even a vege steamer (I bought one and left it).  Another thing worth noting - the apartment is on the third floor with no elevator.  Her neighbors are a bit noisy and there is a lot of noise from the busy street out front (plus a public pool across the street with a lot of kids!).  As a guest you are also required to complete a multi-page additional contract which, come to find out, is pretty useless as the real contract is with Airbnb, not Barb.  If I had known all this, I may have come anyway, but I would have been better prepared.  And, as a last note, I think it's pretty cheeky to ask a guest to do the dishes and put them away when you are paying a hefty cleaning fee."
1721177,19257667,2014-09-09,11547829,Linda,Couldn't fault our stay at Ocean View in any way. The apartment was immaculate on our arrival and the views couldn't be beaten. All the information Barb provided was clear and accurate and our whole stay was totally hassle free. Altogether a great Airbnb experience.
1721177,20311950,2014-09-27,5393631,James,"The townhome was keep and well stocked. The location was great, watch the surfers getting in their early morning rides, walk to the market and nice restaurants. Easy parking, walking, bike trail across the street. Everything was just as described. "
1721177,20750789,2014-10-05,20311716,Debbie,"We had a wonderful stay at this Ocean View Townhouse.  The location is perfect for walking along the coast, to restaurants and shops and Cannery Row.  The views are amazing and the townhouse was immaculate, beautifully decorated and well equipped.  Barb was easy to communicate with and handled a slight problem during our stay quickly.  I highly recommend this townhouse and would love to stay here again!"
1721177,21651358,2014-10-21,16833086,Larry,The property description was perfectly accurate and the host (Barb) made us feel very welcome.
1721177,22086604,2014-10-29,22811702,Michael,"We loved staying here!  The view is just incredible.  The walk to the Aquarium, along the water, is amazingly beautiful.  The home was very comfortable, nicely furnished, and Barbara, our host, was extremely responsive and accommodating.  Her suggestions on nearby attractions and eateries were spot on.  Can't wait to return!"
1721177,22201506,2014-11-01,345538,Yo,"This place was amazing. I didn't realize is was a top floor corner unit with views of the ocean from two sides until I arrived! For a two bedroom unit, it seemed very large (my standards are much smaller since I live in downtown San Francisco). Steps away from the oceanfront walkway, which can bring you to the fisherman's wharf area (aquarium) of Monterrey. Also a very brief and relaxing little walk to the shops/restaurants in downtown Pacific Grove.

Barbara is very professional and the check-in process and communication couldn't have been any easier. Highly recommend the place!"
1721177,22498252,2014-11-08,10460932,Katherine,Truly beautiful view and perfect location. Barb is welcoming and flexible! Loved our stay!!!
1721177,22902806,2014-11-17,22740690,Kevin,Great location and great condo!  I would definitely stay here again.  Beautiful ocean views and conveniently located to a lot of good restaurants in Pacific Grove.  Barb was extremely accommodating and her place was very clean.
1721177,23437448,2014-12-01,15737517,Rebecca,"We enjoyed the uninterrupted views of the sea - really convenient location to explore Big Sur coastline. Don't miss the cafe at Nepenthe, Big Sur. Pacific Grove has some nice shops and restaurants/cafés which are all very close to the apartment. 
The apartment is pristine - thoughtfully equipped. 
Barb was a very good host, she even phoned a few restaurants to find out if they had space for us for thanksgiving dinner. "
1721177,24216600,2014-12-22,5301952,Hovo,"We had a great time. The view was amazing and we were able to park our RV at the parking spots right across the street. 
Barbara was quick to arrange our stay at a very short notice. Thank you Barbara"
1721177,25007069,2015-01-05,647181,Julie,"Barbara was a wonderful host - kind and courteous throughout the entire process. She was available online and over the phone and was very helpful. The apartment was perfect - exactly as described and the view unbeatable. We felt very cozy and comfy during our stay and to wake up to the most beautiful sunsets - what more can I say? If you want to feel like a welcomed guest and experience the beauty of Monterrey from your bedroom, then this is the place to stay! Thanks Barbara - I really hope I will be able to come back one day! "
1721177,25615262,2015-01-20,11217282,Mausami,"This was our first trip out with a newborn. 6 week old newborn. My DH, daughter and I had managed to survive the first 6 weeks and wanted to celebrate the occasion. We were looking for a warm, inviting place place by the ocean with beautiful views where we could sit, relax and breathe for a bit. The condo turned out to be everything that we had wanted and then some! The pictures try but can't capture the beauty and serenity of this property. The first thing that catches your eye when you enter is the beautiful views of the ocean. A lot of thought has been put into decorating the house - the books, lil trinkets, furniture, wall colors, bedrooms, stocked kitchen - every thing has been carefully and lovingly placed in this condo. 

Barbara's an awesome host - super quick to respond and very helpful! The check in and check out process was pretty simple and the map with recommendations for restaurants and things to do around the condo was very thoughtful!

Sitting in the living room with my baby, watching the sunrise in the distance is just one of the many beautiful memories that I took back home with me from this visit. This was definitely the first of many more visits to come for us."
1721177,26702247,2015-02-17,26871662,Rita,"Our family stayed at Barbara's place over a long weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The town home is well cared for and beautifully furnished for a relaxing vacation. The weather was gorgeous and the views from the town home were just as pictured, stunning. Barbara is a great host and took care of every detail so that it was very easy for us to begin enjoying our vacation. 

It is less than a mile to the Monterey Aquarium/Cannery Row and the walk is along a beautiful bike/walking path along the coast. The town of Pacific Grove is a few short blocks away and there are numerous shops and restaurants. The town home overlooks the beach (Lovers Point) where you can rent bikes, swim, kayak, etc. We made the very most of our time. Thank you, Barbara, for your hospitality. "
1721177,26872205,2015-02-21,26436401,Benton,Beautiful accommodations.  The view is unrivaled and the location could not be more ideal.  Highly recommended.

1721177,27341768,2015-03-02,13263452,Natalie,Great stay in Pacific Grove! The location was amazing and so were the views. Everything was SO clean and Barb had everything organized when we arrived. Great places to walk to!
1721177,27769132,2015-03-11,15227387,Mark,This place was great! The view of Lover's Point is fantastic and the aquarium is an easy mile walk along the bay. There are a bunch of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance too. The condo is nicely appointed with furniture and appliances and was neat and tidy when we arrived. We would have loved to stay longer.
1721177,28186040,2015-03-19,29006988,Zachary,Description was perfectly accurate and host very responsive.
1721177,28231802,2015-03-20,29165253,Hui,"Barbara is very nice and the home is perfect!
I will come back next time.
I will tell my friend to here!"
1721177,28790436,2015-03-30,26911930,Phillip,"Amazing views! Amazing location! 
Barb was so easy to communicate with and made our stay very easy to get settled.  The condo is very clean and comfortable making you feel at home.  There is no where else I would want to stay when we come back to monterey/pacific grove."
1721177,29067204,2015-04-03,29683681,Diana,"A perfect get away for rest, adventure, and fun! The location of this condo is amazing. You can watch for sea otters, surfers and sunsets from your living room, wake up to sunrises, and relax in a well equipped lovely condo. We arrived on Monday and walked 3 blocks to the farmers market, rode bikes with our 5 year old to the aquarium, and ate great burgers at the beach just steps away. The town of Pacific Grove is adorable, welcoming, and over the top in charm. We were talking about booking our next visit as soon as we arrived. Thank you!"
1721177,29378695,2015-04-07,9130308,Allison,"The location was perfect, and the views were outstanding! The condo was very clean and comfortable. The location is across the street from the ocean and park. It's a quick walk to cafes, grocery, and restaurants. Pacific Grove is a lovely area, and a perfect place for a quiet getaway."
1721177,29777028,2015-04-12,30060645,Tracie,"We absolutely loved staying at Barb's condo at Lover's Point. The views from the condo were simply stunning. The decor was beautiful.  If a couch is important to you, please note that the sofa has been replaced with four oversized buttery leather chairs. Very comfortable and a great way to enjoy unbelievable views from the living room windows. 

I would not hesitate to recommend the property to friends.  I can't believe something like this even exists so close to the Bay area. 

Kudos."
1721177,30287804,2015-04-20,6963383,Kristen,"Barb was very welcoming and made sure we had all of the check-in information easily available.  

The apartment was exactly as described and the location is 5 Star +.  You are literally across the street from Lover's Point and the Monterrey trail.  We saw whales and otters from the balcony.  

The blow up mattress worked very well and very comfortable for our son.   We definitely plan to book again when we return next year. "
1721177,31447141,2015-05-05,355810,Cliff,"My family (including our 1.5 year old toddler) had a really great time at Barb's place. The location is great, the views are amazing, and she's a thoughtful, friendly host. Every detail was communicated ahead of time so we never had to worry about anything. When we arrived the place was immaculately clean. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook breakfast each morning (well, minus the groceries of course). 

We loved staying here and might make this an annual tradition."
1721177,32142249,2015-05-14,3252992,Shannon,"Barbara was incredibly friendly and helpful, and the views were just as good as they look in the listing pictures! The food in the area is wonderful too - we particularly enjoyed Passionfish."
1721177,32716154,2015-05-20,28244379,.,barb has an amazing apartment! we all enjoyed it and the location is really close to 17 miles and downtown pacific grove. i will come back to this place with my friend in the future.
1721177,33432797,2015-05-28,19132967,Melanie,Your place is amazing. Beautiful views and beautifully decorated. Thank you for quick feedback when we needed it. Great location!  Everything you need us here. More beautiful than the pictures!
1721177,33588174,2015-05-30,31251003,Mark,"We were very lucky to stay in this beautiful apartment with a stunning ocean view. The apartment was clean, delicate, and cozy. The bed are so comfortable. And all the details of check-in and check-outs are very thoughtful. It definitely worth the fortune to stay at this gorgeous apartment. And we even wanted to stay one more nights. Pity we can't ... Thank you Barbara for this wonderful experience!"
1721177,34176060,2015-06-05,5273165,Yiyi,Quick respond and great help
1721177,35104265,2015-06-15,30227622,Aaron,We had such a wonderful time at Barbs place. AMAZING views. Great location. It was perfect. 
1721177,35788481,2015-06-22,29112348,Barbara,"I can only describe this experience as perfect! The apartment is every bit as wonderful as promised on Airbnb, and the views are perfectly stunning. The location is great, with lovely walks in every direction. The space was exceptionally clean and the kitchen a dream: equipped with everything one could desire, all in fantastic condition. 
Communication with Barb was very pleasant and efficient and the local tips she gave, together with a (Hidden by Airbnb) map for their easy location, were right on! 
"
1721177,36971684,2015-07-03,30673631,Joy,Barb was very kind to us even after we filled in the guest information late. The check in process was easy and fast.  The place was very clean and just as described in the listing page. The views are really fantastic and we could just sit there and enjoy the views from both sides of the room.   We also tried out the restaurant which Barb recommended and the food was delicious! It is too bad that we were only able to stay for one night.  We would definitely come back again to stay at this wonderful dream place.
1721177,38099959,2015-07-13,28935769,Randal,"Our one week stay at the Oceanview townhouse at lovers point was the highlight of our 16 days in California. The Townhouse has absolutely amazing views of the ocean and shoreline. It was very clean, modern and well appointed. Barbara was the perfect host; very personable and easy to access. She went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and to ensure that our stay was pleasant. We have been coming out to the Monterey Peninsula for over 20 years and this was probably our best experience in lodgings. Our party all agreed that our only wish was that we had arranged for an even longer time!  I highly recommend Barbara for both her winsome hospitality and the absolutely wonderful accommodations! "
1721177,42584134,2015-08-14,37675051,Jin,The view of Barb's place is amazing. Barbara is the best host I have ever met. The townhome is definitely my parents' favorite place in our summer trip. We wish we could stay there at least one week. 
1721177,45064360,2015-08-31,11189615,Patricia,"Beautiful apartment right across from Lover's Point.  Able to walk to
beach,  restaurants, pool etc.  The apt has 180 degree view of the
beach and ocean.  The beds were comfortable and the kitchen fully
set up for cooking.  The balcony is a lovely place to have a coffee or
a glass of wine over looking the view. It is one mile to the Monterey
Bay Aquarium."
1721177,46130782,2015-09-08,31869434,Martha,"Barb's third-floor corner townhome is located in the best spot in Pacific Grove, overlooking not only Monterey Bay but also Lovers' Point Park and the walking/biking path along the coast. It is also one of the most beautifully appointed homes we have stayed in through AirBnb. The view is exquisite, the beds are large and comfy,  the living and dining areas are relaxing and the kitchen provides everything you need. Plus it is within walking distance to both Pacific Grove village and Monterey and a short drive to grocery stores. From Barb's home we biked south to Asilomar and onto 17-Mile Drive. We enjoyed watching the bay change color depending on the time of day.  Because Pacific Grove is on the south side of the Bay, you can experience both sunrises to the east and sunsets to the west. We even sighted an enormous whale from Barb's balcony. This was one of the best trips we have ever taken due to a unbeatable combination of luxury, location, and opportunities for exercise, people-watching and scenery. Awesome!"
1721177,47969650,2015-09-22,4349061,Andrew,This place was beautiful! The view was amazing and the location was close to everything we wanted to see. Barbara was an excellent host and made herself available to answer any questions we had. I would recommend this home to anyone looking for a fun relaxing stay in Pacific Grove. 
1721177,50341422,2015-10-11,2641710,Carlos,"The property is located in a great area of Pacific Grove. Perfect for a small families. It is about 15 minutes walking distance from the aquarium. The beach is right in front and it is not very touristy. 

The property has all the essentials for cooking and the views from the property are great. "
1721177,50762348,2015-10-14,19755306,Lew,"Most Airbnb locations are great -- this one is amazing!  The pictures are accurate but hardly do the townhome justice.  The view of the water from two sides is awesome -- we could have been content to just sit on the balcony and enjoy the view.  The location is also walking distant to a myriad of restaurants and activities.  The townhome is immaculate, functional and perfect for a getaway.   The greatest disappointment we had was that we had to leave to travel home!!"
1721177,51113734,2015-10-18,37255418,Anne,"Barb was great to work with. She gave us easy access to the unit & made herself available if we needed anything. The end unit was clean & it had a beautiful view. There are 3 flights of stairs but once you are inside the views made it worthwhile. The location is perfect, we walked to the Monterey Aquarium & several places for dinner including the one right across the street on the water (the scallop pot pie was amazing!) Barb suggested a few places to eat that were great, the breakfast place (Awakenings) down the road was delicious. All in all we enjoyed our time there, it was a perfect location & well maintained with gorgeous views. "
1721177,55370598,2015-12-01,10828326,Tanice,"This apartment was incredible in all respects!  We spent our Thanksgiving weekend here, right on the beach in Pacific Grove and it was perfect.  As you can see from the picture, the view can't be beat, particularly the sunrise.  The apartment is clean and comfortable and has everything your need and more.  From the very beginning my contact with Barb was immediate, friendly and always helpful.  It's in a perfect location for walking into town or Monterey, riding bikes and walking on the path along the ocean.  From here we could easily explore Carmel and Big Sur. What a find!"
1721177,56901094,2015-12-19,22268162,Haidong,"the house is good,I 'm very enjoy this home!"
1721177,58030686,2015-12-31,10365676,Jeff,"Great host and great home!  Barbara was very easy to work with and she had very clear instructions from checkin through checkout.  The place has stunning views, as shown in the pictures.  We were 4 adults total and the space was perfect for us.  We enjoyed a few nights in cooking and watching movies at the home and we all had plenty of room to stretch out.  

The location was great.  We spent a few days hiking in Limekiln, Andrew Molera and Julia Pfeiffer and all the parks were between 30 min and 2 hour drive away.  Most importantly, the beach was right downstairs.  Perfect for a walk / run on the beach or you can watch the sun set from living room.  "
1721177,59854488,2016-01-16,8013240,Dale,Barb sent her assistant to welcome my wife and assist her with carrying her luggage up to the apartment.
1721177,60132342,2016-01-19,43740774,Kamson,"We had a wonderful stay at Barb's home in Pacific Grove. The home is bright, spacious, with a stunning view of the ocean. It's also conveniently located within 5 minutes drive to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Barb was a gracious host and provided us with all the information we need for the stay. Thank you!"
1721177,60966840,2016-01-30,51240800,Tao,"Perfect room, nice view of sea, very kind of service, convenient transportation to 17 miles. 
Thanks a lot to Barb."
1721177,61273947,2016-02-01,36913754,Tatiana,"Beautiful apartment with amazing view on the ocean. Super clean! The host was nice and attentive.
We had a very pleasant time! "
1721177,61771731,2016-02-08,52715652,Mary Anne,"We had a great week long stay in this spacious and well appointed condo. Barb was communicative, answered questions quickly and was welcoming every step of the way from the booking through our arrival. The photos of the views are actually very accurate. The only way to improve on the view would be to bring binoculars! We saw otters, harbor seals and whales from this spectacular vantage point. Easy walk to Aquarium, Cannery Row, dining, shops, and endless oceanfront pathways for miles of walking. The fully equipped kitchen made it easy to dine in and enjoy the views, even from the kitchen window. What a charming town of PG, away from the crowds of Carmel and Monterey! Highly recommend this rental. Thank you Barb. "
1721177,62303651,2016-02-13,48731425,Raymond,Wonderful view and comfortable apartment!
1721177,62946349,2016-02-18,7532803,Trang,Barbara is a great communicator. she was very quick in answering all the questions we had.The view was just amazing. The house was so clean. Thanks for the comfortable beds. Got access to the beach in a few minutes walk.   Our family had such a wonderful time in her beautiful home. Will definitely come back again in the future. 
1721177,63478589,2016-02-23,55691750,Carol,"Barb was a very nice and hospitable host! The unit is spectacular! It is very well appointed with nice art work, furnishings and a well-stocked kitchen. We only wish we could have stayed longer."
1721177,63603148,2016-02-24,25160644,An,Great host. Great apt. 
1721177,64803046,2016-03-08,25938615,Hambleton,Barbara was very helpful in sending us instructions and providing us with a great list of places to go in the area.  The view is fantastic and the location is excellent.  
1721177,65438328,2016-03-13,1489059,Raja,"Sent us a detailed document with instructions for how to get into the house, where parking is, where things are in the house, and suggestions for surrounding attractions. Very well organized."
1721177,65808276,2016-03-17,57190879,Karen,"We had a great experience at Barbs condo in Ocean Grove! The apt was just as she described it except the view was even better. We had printed instructions from her that gave us all of the info that we needed incl directions, parking info, wifi and grocery store information. The condo was 1 mi walk (a beautiful walk) to Monterey. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend her apt to anyone interested in seeing Monterey. Thank you"
1721177,66371950,2016-03-22,51737157,Sharona,Ocean View Townhouse has amazing views and an ideal location.  The apartment is very well equipped and maintained. Before arrival the Welcome Information was excellent and the handy tips on where to shop for groceries etc was helpful. We look forward to returning one day!
1721177,68085620,2016-04-02,20665563,Clare,"Barbara was fantastically welcoming even before we arrived with really helpful information that she sent far in advance, important for our trip as we were staying half-way through a long trip.  It is clear that Barbara's focus is on her guests having a wonderful time in a wonderful place. 

The apartment itself has the most stunning views - it is actually better than in the photos.  At the end of a long drive, we opened the door and as one said, ""Wow"".  The kitchen is very well equipped, the instructions are clear and the beds unbelievably comfortable.  We all wish we could have stayed longer.

This place is amazing. 

The only other tip I would give is, if you are driving, get an Uber to the Aquarium and back, because the parking is $30 flat rate (Uber is about $10 there and back)."
1721177,68550304,2016-04-05,10331380,Angela,Barbara was very communicative and helpful during the entire process. She provided great recommendations and always available when needed.  The pictures directly reflect the wonderful view and how comfortable the condo was.  We really liked the neighborhood as well and found it was very easy not to use our car.  
1721177,71689636,2016-04-27,47848443,Meera,"A truly marvelous place as others have described. The pics don't do it justice. We took advantage of as much as we could (especially with 2 toddlers!). The residence is right across the street from the beach; a place to rent bikes, kayaks, etc. a nice walk to aquarium and other sights. Barb is a great host...very clear in residence welcome and do's and don'ts; helpful lists of sights and restaurants. Was incredibly accommodating when we had some unexpected date challenges. All made for a great vacation. Will definitely go again. "
1721177,71948120,2016-04-30,17100877,Laura,Barb is very helpful and informative about the condo and surrounding area! The condos views and location are perfect and beds quite comfortable. The kitchen is very well stocked with cooking utensils/items. Great trip!
1721177,73402983,2016-05-08,58334307,Ada,"We really enjoyed our stay at Barbara's place. The location was perfect for walking around Pacific Grove, going out to eat, and enjoying that amazing view. The apartment was as described and pictured. The only issue was a broken set of window blinds in the bedroom. Though we never met Barbara, she was very helpful by email both before we arrived and during our stay. She generously offered to let us check out late on the last day so that we could enjoy some extra time in Pacific Grove. We would definitely return the next time we are visiting the area and also recommend Barbara's place to our friends."
1721177,74900296,2016-05-17,8814133,Jacqui,"What a fantastic apartment and location. It has everything you need for a relaxing stay, and Barb is a very gracious host who quickly answers any questions you have. We will definitely be back!"
1721177,75103168,2016-05-18,18455756,Mao,"Barb's house is located with the best view,very quiet and cozy house.The garage is good too.Nice experience at here."
1721177,76314927,2016-05-26,10351743,Brenden,"Amazing experience for first time Airbnb user! Everything we needed was right there. Incredible view of the ocean, very clean, and perfect location. Would definitely recommend to everyone! "
1721177,77809221,2016-06-03,6924232,Alison,"I absolutely LOVED my stay at Ocean View.  Barb was incredibly helpful from the very start.  She made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed.  The place was stunning, with breathtaking views that I enjoyed the entire week.  It was so conveniently located to several area attractions.  It was so nice to fall asleep to the sounds of the water right outside the window.  I definitely want to plan another stay here!"
1721177,79015393,2016-06-10,13444082,Dick,"Barb made us feel very welcome. She contacted us the day we were to arrive to make certain we could get in. Barb gave very detailed instructions about where everything was and how to run heat etc. The place looked just like the pictures in the listing, even better. "
1721177,80266427,2016-06-17,18084391,Hailey,Barb was the best host I've ever met in my Airbnb experience. She is a very nice and caring person. She gave us everything we need to know about the house in advance so everything including check in and out procedure was easy and  quick. Her house was absolutely breathtaking. I encountered the most beautiful sunrise in this house's bedroom. Will visit again definitely!
1721177,80677769,2016-06-19,73080898,Korie And Brandon,"Barb is the perfect host and made us feel very welcome. Her home is gorgeous! The pictures do not do it justice. The location was great and within walking distance to great beaches and walking trails. The home is very clean and  comfortable, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was on the firm side, and very comfy and had super soft linens. This location is great if you like A LOT of people. Lovers point is awesome and also very busy! There's always something/someone to watch off of the balcony. One caution though...because it is so busy, there is A LOT of road noise from the passing traffic below. The home is on the 3rd floor and faces the busy street so you will hear everything (all night), but that's your give-and-take for the amazing view! All in all this home is wonderful! "
1721177,81249875,2016-06-21,63631828,David,"We were made to feel very welcome.  If anything, the description was too modest, as it's an absolutely spectacular place.  The only problem: It's possible that you'll spend your entire stay staring out the window ... utterly transfixed by the stunning view."
1721177,81822319,2016-06-25,56648852,Shelby,We had such a wonderful time at Barbara's Ocean View townhome. The townhome was in a perfect location close to everything. Barbara was so very organized and helpful with the entire process. We hope to be back again soon.
1721177,82627238,2016-06-28,8121481,Jen,"Wow! What a wonderful place with spectacular views of the ocean. Exceeded expectations and just steps from the door is a great little beach for little ones and anyone up for a bit of sunbathing. Clean and just as described. We wanted to stay longer and didn't want to leave! Will be keeping this place in mind if we ever travel down to Pacific Grove again. Thanks, Barbara!"
1721177,83281337,2016-07-02,77291729,Claudia,"The place was nice.  Great views, though the sun never came out, but that's no ones fault.  Barb was nice on the phone.  Place very clean and thoughtfully stocked.  Furniture a big disappointment and not as shown.  Three old leather lounge chairs pushed up against the wall, not allowing you to cozy up to your loved one, with the nice views.  Felt like a rental with not a lot of love.  Location good, with restaurant across the street, and lot of action across the street.  Could definitely use an update on the decor.  "
1721177,84113826,2016-07-05,69116508,Adam,A beautiful apartment with a magnificent view. We were there for a long weekend with our son and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Easy walk to fabulous restaurants and a mile from the incredible and unforgettable Monterey Aquarium. Private parking space made it easy. Highest recommendation for sure! 
1721177,84930017,2016-07-09,134477,Janos P,"Our favorite view so far + super accessible - PG downtown is just a couple of blocks away with cafes & shops and the beach is literally across the road. This is a top floor condo in a small apartment complex and the living & master bedroom overlooks Monterey Bay.

Barb is very responsive and flexible host and tried to solve all our troubles."
1721177,85742524,2016-07-13,75222775,Jennifer,"We had a very nice time at the OceanView Townhome in Pacific Grove. It was great to watch the activity at Lover's Point: scuba divers, bike riders, swimmers, etc.  We walked to Lover's Point and watched a sea lion come up to the rocks where we were.  We could walk to restaurants and the Aquarium.  My husband and I walked a few mornings and ended up on the peer in  Monterrey - we also came across historical sites and had a lovely time learning about the Cannery industry.  The townhome was clean and the view was spectacular!  We would stay there again for sure.  Barbara was a delight to work with and very accommodating."
1721177,86062244,2016-07-14,67813649,Jill,"We stayed two nights in Barbara's beautiful apartment in Pacific Grove. The views and location were stunning, it's close enough to walk to the Aquarium and Cannery Row and Pacific Grove has many fabulous restaurants to enjoy for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The apartment itself was spotlessly clean, and perfect for our needs. Barb left great recommendations and communication was excellent. Thanks for a great stay."
1721177,86896557,2016-07-18,40280068,Emma,Monterey and Carmel was a lovely place to visit. The view from the apartment was really nice but the interior and shower needs some updating. Barb was really friendly and thorough with our check in and information about the house although I feel the disclaimer that we had to sign was a bit too much. Overall we had a lovely stay!
1721177,88778128,2016-07-25,64566122,Terry,"We loved our stay in the Ocean View Penthouse.  The views were fantastic, just as promised!  We took full advantage of being able to walk to yummy restaurants, to quaint coffee shops and to the famous Cannery Row.  The Penthouse Apartment was nicely furnished and we found everything we needed.  Our family is already talking about staying here again!"
1721177,89827261,2016-07-30,86439214,Yun,"Nice location, convenient neighorhood, very informative and helpful owner!"
1721177,90444787,2016-08-01,85763700,Cliff,"Great location!!  My girlfriend and I took a trip up the central coast to celebrate her birthday. We spent two nights at this home in Pacific Grove and had an amazing time. There was a community celebration going on called the ""Feast of Lanterns"" that ended with a fireworks show in the bay, in which we had a front row seat from our balcony. Barbara was a great host and communication was very good. We enjoyed our stay so much that we are now looking for a home in the area!"
1721177,91501471,2016-08-05,69565604,Kristian,"To start, Barb was great with communication.  She made sure to contact my wife and I before arrival to let us know that the cleaning was finished early so that we may check in before the official check in time.  Upon arriving, we were stunned with the amazing views and location.  The pictures could not easily do it justice, as you will see for yourself!  Some reviewers have mentioned the street noise, but this seemed minimal to me and didn't negatively impact us in any way.  We had planned on driving most places (aquarium and restaurants), but this was unnecessary, as everything ended up being a much shorter walk than we expected.  This location was within a short walking distance to all local restaurants, markets and attractions that we went to, making it extremely convenient.  The inside of the living space was absolutely beautiful as well, with only a few small disappointments that could easily be fixed with a little attention to detail.  These included the chairs in the living room, which keep you from laying down with someone to watch television after a long day exploring the beautiful surroundings.  If you want to cuddle up in front of the TV, your choices are the floor in the living room or the bedroom.  Also, when going to prepare a pasta meal one day, we purchased tomatoes from the local market for sauce, but during cooking I went to the spice rack to find that the main spices (oregano, basil, Italian seasoning) were all completely empty.  This was a bit unexpected and inconvenient, as I had to stop and make a run to the store in the middle of making a meal.  There were a couple other details that we felt could have been avoided with a bit more attention to detail, such as the first aid kit having only a few items left in it, and there being no tissues available (only toilet paper to blow your nose).  When my wife got a small cut, we looked in the kit to find no bandages or antibiotic ointment, etc.  Again, these problems were all minor, but for the price of the stay we felt that they should not have been overlooked.  Overall, a great place that even with a few minor imperfections you will likely not regret your choice to stay there.  Just too much to love about the location and view.  Barb followed up with an email to make sure our stay was pleasant, which was a nice finishing touch!  Would stay there again and recommend to friends and family, mostly due to the location, view, and overall helpfulness of the host."
1721177,92652855,2016-08-09,16259805,Tonya,"Great location!  Walk to restaurants at the cute Pacific Grove downtown and of course walk the beach trail.  
The condo was very comfortable, nice kitchen for meals etc.
Barb was super responsive and checked in during our stay as well."
1721177,97803585,2016-08-28,81320549,Carrianne,"The pictures are beautiful - and they don't do this home justice! The breathtaking view from both the living room and master bedroom floor-to-ceiling windows melts the work week away. My toddler son, of few words, said, ""Wow!"" when we first entered. As if that wasn't enough, you're steps away from the beach and trail that Lover's Point offers. The quaint downtown area, just a few blocks away, is filled with delicious restaurant options  and unique shops. Carmel and Monterey are within a few minutes drive. 

Barbara is a lovely host, providing (via email) suggestions on restaurants, shops, etc, and you can tell she really cares about giving her guests an enjoyable experience, offering comfortable and lovely furnishings. 

To sum it up, this will be the first place we'll check on our next trip back. "
1721177,103843837,2016-09-24,16641930,Jameel,"Barbara was very nice and made us feel quite welcome, the ocean view town home is perfectly located and adequately equipped, very quite and relaxing stay, would certainly come again."
1721177,104183928,2016-09-25,92335577,Stephanie,"Barbara is a dream host to work with.  She communicated everything well in advance and as we were getting ready to head over, she went above and beyond in allowing us to park at the home while housecleaning was there and unload our car before we headed onto our adventures.  Then with checkout she offered us a later time, which we gladly accepted since it allowed our 1 year old a solid nap that morning.  

The home is AMAZING.  It's immaculately clean.  The views are outstanding.  It is just a few steps away from the beach, and it is such a great location!  Also having kids, it is a great place, there aren't a bunch of knick knacks to worry about.  The sliding doors lock solidly, so that reassured me.  We had a wonderful time, and are already looking at our calendars for another trip."
1721177,110016740,2016-10-23,67250613,Kevin,"Amazing location, incredible views, beautiful apartment, and perfect host."
1721177,112187436,2016-11-04,6519648,Jon,"Fantastic! Even better than the pictures!

We were pleasantly surprised by the small storage area to lock up our bikes (had originally planned to leave them in the car when not in use). The ocean side bike ride to Cannery Row / Fisherman's Wharf is convenient and unimaginably picturesque."
1721177,113981494,2016-11-14,27377816,Suse,"The view is priceless.  Great location.  Walking distance to downtown Monterey, a short drive to Seventeen Mile Drive and across the street from Lovers Point.  

Other than the sound of the ocean waves at night the place was pretty quiet with the exception of some noise from the walkway near the back bedroom.  

I'd say if you want location go for it!  Barb was accessible and responsive  when I reached out to her."
1721177,114880795,2016-11-20,14694421,Nicolas,"Barbara was an amazing host, and the property was awesome. Extremely clean, in a great location, amazing views of the water throughout the town home. Nothing quite like waking up to crashing waves on the beach across the street. I would definitely recommend Barbara's town home!"
1721177,115339868,2016-11-23,90844052,Tamara,"Absolutely gorgeous location, right at the Lovers Cove, a lovely condo with an airy, beachy charm. Barb was a hostess with the mostest--she communicated really well and made sure we were absolutely comfortable and had everything we needed. We cannot wait to be back. "
1721177,116559797,2016-12-01,1174517,Maria,Fantastic location & beautiful apartment
1721177,122026538,2016-12-20,24854312,Gunil,"Barb truly deserves to be called a ""Super Host"".
Her home is beautiful, with an amazing view.  It's within walking distance of the Aquarium, restaurants, shops, and the beach.  We wished that we could have stayed longer."
1721177,127055867,2017-01-15,57153670,Kevin,Great place. Exactly as advertised. Would return.
1721177,127227599,2017-01-16,3680022,Marina,Amazing apartment. We didn't want to leave. 
1721177,127600374,2017-01-19,19960649,Prab,I will always  try to stay here on any future trips. 
1721177,128155670,2017-01-22,5821490,Eddie,"Barbara was great! Very responsive and helpful when we needed it.

The Place: all about that view. It really is as good as the photos show. Beds were comfy and the space is well decorated. The street noise is audible inside, but it wasn't an issue for us.

Location: very close to shops, restaurants and a grocery store, and right across the street from the wonderful Lover's Point. Nightlife is only a mile away, but its more cabbing-distance than walking.

My parents and I had a wonderful stay. Thank you Barbara!"
1721177,129216668,2017-01-29,84552916,Stephanie,We loved our stay here!! The location could not be better! There are beautiful walking/running/biking paths steps from the apartment and the town/restaurants are in walking distance too. The views are stunning! The apartment had everything we needed and was very clean. We were delighted to have some extra time at check in/check out. Everything was great and we would love to come back!

"
1721177,135031505,2017-03-02,53933873,Olga,"The apartment is very nice, and the view is everything! Waking up and first thing you see is the ocean - isn't it the best way to do vacation? You can walk to the wharf and enjoy the aquarium, or you may wanna see the beginning on the 17 mile drive  -it's the most beautiful walk you'll ever have! The place is clean and has everything for a comfortable stay."
1721177,139854766,2017-03-26,118211721,Edward,priceless view and location!!!!
1721177,143640754,2017-04-12,125022123,Nancy,"If you don't choose this condo your going to miss out on a spectacular place, everything is upscale and the view from the condo is simply outstanding.  Nancy Brown"
1721177,144121430,2017-04-14,54380726,Michelle,"Our family had a wonderful stay at this lovely, breathtaking ocean view home! You can walk across the street to the beach and there's a trail for you to walk/run about 1 mile to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

We brought our two kids who are 2.5 yr old and 14 months old. They had a pack n play with linens at the home which they let us use which was a huge plus! Everything was super clean and very minimal items around the house which makes it super kid proof :)

We can't wait to stay in the future!"
1721177,145287780,2017-04-17,42782318,Katie,I travelled with my husband and daughter for a long weekend at the coast and Barb's place was perfect. The view was as great as the description says. It was also the most child-friendly Airbnb we have stayed at with our daughter. There was even a pack-and-play in the closet (which I wish I had known before I shoehorned ours in the car! Haha). A great walkable location that we hope to come back to in the future!
1721177,145924524,2017-04-20,48818843,Thang,Amazing location and views! Best unit in the complex! 
1721177,148031886,2017-04-29,121958454,Albert,This is a lovely house with exclusive location and stunning view! It sits right across the Lover Point and you can see the whole ocean view of the bay. The kitchen facilities are ready to cook a home made dinner. It was an amazing experience to stay here. 
1721177,151231503,2017-05-11,114883269,Vahe,Great views! Nice clean home! 
1721177,151661543,2017-05-13,19516212,John,Barb's place is the ideal place for a vacation. She was extremely friendly and accommodating. The condo is in a perfect location. The morning and evening views are breathtaking. My only complaint is that didn't have enough time to stay longer. I would highly recommend this local and certainly look forward to coming back again. 
1721177,152076227,2017-05-14,20225562,Samir,Barbara's townhouse has a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean. Waking up to the view is rejuvenating. We enjoyed our Mothers' Day stay here 
1721177,152503588,2017-05-16,26601868,Lingtian,The location is amazing and Barbara is very nice!
1721177,152665500,2017-05-17,16263613,Wilson,Barbara does a flawless job in terms of ensuring a flawless check-in and check-out experience for the absolutely private apartment. Not to mention the second-to-none ocean view from the place. Will definitely come again!
1721177,152817323,2017-05-18,37864492,Xinnan Wang,Nice place to stay!
1721177,156246133,2017-05-29,125017837,Jean,"Great location, with a beautiful view!  The perfect place for riding bikes, walking along a beach path, or people watching from the balcony. The host is friendly and professional; Apt. is clean and comfortable.  "
1721177,159105509,2017-06-09,35284946,Michael,Amazing sea view house have ever lived. Hope have chance to stay longer next time.
1721177,162188126,2017-06-19,126310181,Ashley,"I wish I could give more than five stars! We didn't want to leave! The location is perfect and within walking distance of many great shops and restaurants and the views from the home are breathtaking. Barb is very communicative, friendly and thorough, providing detailed instructions for access and the home had lots of material to help you explore and utilize all the home's features and appliances. The WiFi was fast too! There are stairs involved with accessing the home, but it wasn't difficult and was well worth it. We just wish we could  stay longer! Thank you Barb!"
1721177,163162582,2017-06-23,123641060,Tamera,"I opened the front door and said ""holy cow!""  Even though it looks exactly like the pictures it's somehow even better in person. It's more spacious in person for sure. We stayed mid week in June and had no problem with street parking for our second car, but we walked everywhere. Barbara made the entire process effortless. I can't wait to stay there again  "
1721177,163453538,2017-06-24,79570620,Matt,"Location is amazing, views are stunning. That is pretty much the ball game. The apartment is comfortable, has plenty of kitchen gear so you can cook, bedrooms are larger, everything works as you would expect, so you don't have to know any ""family secrets"" to get the TV on for example. Barb is an excellent host - super organized and on top of you stay. When we visit Pacific Grove again, we will stay there again. We visited Big Basin State Park, take a couple of hours to get there from PG. We also ate at the restaurant right across the street from the apartment, right on the Ocean, again, great views, but I would suggest going up to the main street - food was OK, but for the price it should have been much better."
1721177,167449306,2017-07-06,25515695,Elise,Barbara was a great host. She left a lot of helpful instructions. She helped and was responsive when we reached out. The apartment was a great location and had amazing views. Our family really enjoyed the space and the area. We would recommend this place and Barbara to anyone. We would love to come back!

1721177,169777610,2017-07-13,70722735,Sherry,Barbara's place is a charm. The best ocean view you could expect. Barb herself is very friendly and helpful & gave us detailed instructions as well as a (Hidden by Airbnb) map of attractions and restaurants. Would definitely recommend.
1721177,172752696,2017-07-21,134526986,Victor,"The home is great, very clean, a lot of towels, bed sheets, very well equipped, you can cook basically anything you want with the equipment on the kitchen.
Big TV on the living room, and a small tv on each bedroom.
We had only a minor problem, the wi-fi signal was a little weak, but to be honest I didn't even complain as it didn't affect us.
Also, just as observation, the house is on the third floor (two flight of stairs)."
1721177,174114132,2017-07-24,19307897,Alan,"Great apartment in fantastic location right overlooking the bay with wraparound views. Handy for a great selection of restaurants and cafes, short walk to Aquarium and Cannery Row. Can hire bikes, kayaks, boogie boards and SUP, within 100 yards of the apartment, and plenty of good rocks to clamber on and hunt for crabs and things. We had a great time here."
1721177,175378261,2017-07-28,130894785,Dan,"The view makes it easy to overlook everything else about this place that is good! Very comfortable, easy to drive to, easy parking... location at Lovers Point is great - walkable/bikable to Cannery Row and around coast to Asilomar, beach across the way teeming with activity during the day, but quiet and peaceful at night and in the morning. Nice restaurant right at the point - as well a place for burgers/ice cream down by the beach... and a few very reasonable places to eat right up the hill (easy walk) - didn't even have to go to Cannery if we didn't want to.  Barb was very, very helpful and responsive - gave us great advice on what to do and was immediately responsive when we had asks during our stay.

And that view... my wife and I would sit on the balcony and remark that we couldn't believe we were staying there!"
1721177,180203685,2017-08-09,45558283,Mackenzie,"It was a great stay! A nice condo, seems to be competitive pricing for anything with an ocean view.  That was the best luxury of the place."
1721177,187801679,2017-08-27,37945725,Annie,"This place is fabulous!!! We stayed here for a couples weekend and loved being right across the street from Lovers Point. We took walks down to Cannery Row, and it's a great jumping off point for all the sights in a Carmel, Pebble Beach and Monterey. Plus the views are spectacular. We felt right at home in the condo. You can't go wrong!!!!"
1721177,191777271,2017-09-08,52037592,Ammar,"barbaras apartment was excellent ...the view was exactly as shown on her site

1721177,200238785,2017-10-04,106776972,Aris,Fantastic location overlooking the open sea. Very convenient to restaurants and a beautiful stroll away to Monterrey.
1721177,200833182,2017-10-06,59798842,Amy,"Barb是一位很热情的房东,总是可以在第一时间响应我们的消息。她的房子位置不错,在情人点公园对面,面朝大海风景很好。虽然公寓不是那么新,但房间和地毯打扫的很干净,如果厨房和卫生间角落可以清洁的再仔细一些就完美了。有一点不如意的是,由于我们行程改变,在前几天才预定了Barb 的家,但在我们付款后才收到房东邮件要求填写一个入住表格,必须用电脑操作,手机不可以,房东也不接受消息直接回复。对于处在长途旅行中的我们,没有电脑,费了九牛二虎之力才找到一个电脑按照要求回复了邮件,之后才收到了入住介绍。这使得我们花费了很长时间,导致之后的行程格外紧张并不得不取消了两个景点。希望房东以后可以选择多种渠道处理此事。"
1721177,201712637,2017-10-08,102007147,Benjamin,"I cannot say enough about the view, especially at sunrise. Magical. Such a wonderful respite away from busy areas such as cannery row and the aquarium."
1721177,202538250,2017-10-11,152291121,Michael,"Barb's place was cozy, modern, beautiful, and overall amazing. Waking up in the morning and seeing that wonderful ocean view first thing in the morning was an unforgettable experience. Wish there was more time in the day so that I could've sat out on the balcony even longer, watching the waves crash on the shore."
1721177,202761005,2017-10-12,114420762,Vito,Great place with a great host . Thank you

Barb is a great host, she is very friendly and very responsive and helpful when needed.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us.  We had a great time."
1721177,205032593,2017-10-20,79069227,Hannah,Absolutely amazing view!!! Can’t be beat. The place was very clean and fully stocked for cooking. So close to the beach and also walkable to shops and restaurants.

1721177,210474604,2017-11-09,61017426,Anna,"I treated my Brother & his family to a stay-cation, somewhere close to the Monterey Aquarium, walking distance to the beach, park, and restaurants.  They were amazed by the GORGEOUS views in Barb's Townhouse overlooking the beach and ocean - It literally took their breath away!!"
1721177,211380835,2017-11-12,144893002,Linda,This townhouse is beautiful and the location is stunning. The views of the ocean and Lovers Point make it hard to leave. It is surrounded by fantastic restaurants within walking distance. It is the perfect place for a getaway!

Barb was very responsive and so easy to work with. No hiccups at all!"
1721177,233702118,2018-02-10,159002130,Carolyn,"This apartment is as shown in the photos with amazing ocean views from the living/dining area and main bedroom. An easy walk to the main part of Pacific Grove. So dining was delicious and easy. (We especially enjoyed Passionfish, Pepper’s Mexicali Cafe, and Holly’s Lighthouse Cafe). Barb and her husband graciously assisted us with my confusion with the TV. Very clean apartment with an excellent firm mattress. We wished we could have stayed longer!"
1721177,234184138,2018-02-11,155415438,Bruno,"Great place to be !! Barbara is really helpful and her communication is quick and efficient! 
Merci beaucoup!!!!!"

1721177,240383560,2018-03-04,75196136,Neil,"The views are at least as good as they look in the photos,  and Barb was a responsive host. We especially liked that she recommended several restaurants and markets within walking distance."
1721177,240683177,2018-03-05,112356186,Jonathan,Great location and spectacular views.  Barb was very responsive and accomodating.
1721177,244862207,2018-03-19,100971065,Michelle,"Amazing views and a comfortable apartment for up to five people.  Downtown shopping, restaurants as well as tide pools are well within a one to two block walk.  The pictures tell the story!
Thanks Barb.  This was a very memorable weekend for us."
1721177,250048409,2018-04-03,138933129,Charles,"This was our first Airbnb experience. Barb was the most gracious host, and her place didn’t disappoint at all.  Breathtaking views of the Monterey Bay were accurate, and as advertised. The location is literally across the street from Lover’s Point. (The weekend was a bit noisy, but that’s to be expected anywhere along the coast). This place was perfect for a couple, and we look forward to staying here again! Thanks Barb!!"
1721177,251304458,2018-04-07,40714257,Shauna,"Seriously, you can't beat the location! The view was gorgeous and we could walk to the aquarium.  It was absolutely perfect for us.  The check-in and check-out process was easy and efficient and I'd highly recommend this spot to anyone! Thank you Barb!"
1721186,8681847,2013-11-11,7250374,Stuart,This is a fantastic 2 bedroom house with an unbeatable location in Pacific Grove next to the ocean.  The pictures do not do the house justice.  It is very well put together and incredibly comfortable.  The beds are great.  Terrific place and equally terrific host.
1721186,9627660,2014-01-03,10870422,Brian,"This is truly a beautiful villa. The decor is what you'd expect in a luxury hotel...modern and elegant. The front room is cozy where you can relax, read or watch tv, warmed by a fire. The beautiful kitchen makes cooking seem more important. You can dine inside or outside by the fire pit. The bathroom features a Jacuzzi tub that soothes the stress away. 

You have two semi ocean views...1) If you are close to the front room window and 2) if you are on the back patio you can also see the ocean through the hedges. Open the front door however, you are one house away from the ocean front. The Beach House restaurant is across the way and it offers a lovely view of the coast line. Cannery row is a few minutes drive and downtown Pacific Grove is walking distance. There are also passes to the aquarium! All in all, it's a lovely experience. Thanks Barb!"
1721186,9922705,2014-01-19,9773492,Jonathan,Barb's place was FANTASTIC! It was so lovely and so close to the beach! She was extremely responsive and so kind. I would recommend staying with Barb to everyone!
1721186,11095201,2014-03-20,12305076,Gerry,"I have stayed in many different houses and apartments, and this was, hands-down, the absolute best.  It's a gorgeous, spacious house in the best possible location in Pacific Grove - right across from the beach / walking path and in the lovely Victorian district - there's also a park  2 minutes walk away that has a fabulous farmer's market on Monday.  Everything in the house was beautifully designed and maintained - it really was a home rather than a rental.  Barb was fabulous throughout - thank you so much!"
1721186,11154250,2014-03-23,12486461,Tracy,"Great house, so close to the ocean we could hear the waves!!"
1721186,11207293,2014-03-24,13311947,Shannon,"My family and I had a wonderful stay here. The house is beautifully finished. It had all the amenities and simplicity of a high-quality hotel, but all the peace and comfort of a home. It really did feel like our own secret beach villa! Just a block up from the ocean in a quieter corner of Monterey, the stay was quiet and so cozy. After a walk along the water and exploring the rocky point just steps away from the house, we had a bbq and fire on the patio! Talk about a beach paradise. 

Barb was the most gracious and contentious host. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to any and all of our friends!"
1721186,11412638,2014-04-01,3552577,Christopher,"The Pacific Grove villa was lovely. We enjoyed our stay there with our 18 month old son. The home was pretty child-friendly. We had parks close by, family friendly restaurants, passes to the Monterey Aquarium and lots to see. We were on our baby moon, as we are expecting twins early this summer. The master bedroom was furnished with a King-sized bed, which was extremely comfy for my pregnant wife. We will be back again for sure.

Our host was very easy to communicate with. She responded quickly to use and even let us check out later to accommodate our son's nap schedule. This was our second AirBnb experience and first in the U.S."
1721186,11574912,2014-04-07,4523730,Daniel,Barb accommodated us perfectly - communicated clearly and easily. The house was beautiful and only a block away from the waterfront which was beyond amazing. Lover's Point is down the street by the water front and has a park and restaurant which served pretty good. I am definitely thinking about heading to Barb's place again for a long weekend. 
1721186,11763001,2014-04-14,1662497,Jonathan,Barb's home was the prefect setup for our trip. My wife and in-laws loved the place and the attention to details.  Everything was top notch and well worth the price.  My favorite aspect was the 30 second walking distance to the boardwalk from where we could rent bikes or just stroll 20 minutes north to visit the aquarium and enjoy great food at cannery row.
1721186,12533498,2014-05-05,12366376,Olga,"My family of four has spent a long weekend at the Beautiful Villa in Pacific Grove and it was a wonderful experience. The house turned out exactly as described - painstakingly remodeled with high end materials, finishes and appliances, very cozy and tastefully decorated. On top of it there was also a great private patio. The location was perfect - two steps from the ocean front and a walking distance from most major points of interest in Monterey. 
Our special thanks to Barbara - she's the most welcoming and helpful host! We appreciated her list of recommendations for restaurants, groceries and everything else you would need in the unfamiliar place - it's spot on. The only thing I would add to the list is Traders's Joe that's right next to Safeway market :) The complimentary passes to Monterey Aquarium were a very nice touch.
Thank you Barbara!"
1721186,12760075,2014-05-10,7947121,Osman,"Barb was a superb host.  The arrangements were perfect, and she was in touch throughout to make sure we didn't miss anything we needed. 

The villa is very quaint, nicely furnished and just steps away from the ocean. The photos don't do it justice. 
"
1721186,12858220,2014-05-12,4383312,V,"I reserved Barb's Beautiful Villa with Ocean View for a Mother's Day weekend getaway. Barbara made it so easy to check-in, and check-out. She really is a great communicator (although I didn't have to contact her much, but when I did, she made herself available to get a hold), and she has the house stocked with everything we could need from dinnerware, blankets, towels, gas grill. The space is warm, inviting and has calm, positive energy. There were 3 adults and a child, and there was enough space for all of us! Other than the house that we completely took advantage of,  we took advantage of its location. We couldn't have had a better time, especially our walks to the aquarium, and the beach (which is literally across the street). "
1721186,15342263,2014-07-07,16678899,Megan,"We had a great time staying here over 4th of July.  The location is perfect - right next to the walking trail, very close to the aquarium, and of course right across the street from the beach.  We made heavy use of the aquarium passes and also really enjoy the nearby Dennis the Menace park (my 2 yr old son loved it!). Barb was incredibly responsive with any questions we had, and the house was clean and really well setup.  I would definitely recommend others who are looking for a great location near Monterey to stay here - we really enjoyed!!"
1721186,15671642,2014-07-14,13166446,Pia,Location! Location! Location!  You cannot find a better place to stay in Pacific Grove.  You are literally steps away from the ocean and gorgeous Lover's Point.  The house is lovely and well appointed.  A nice treat is the passes to the aquarium provided by the host.  
1721186,15787192,2014-07-15,17508869,Bill,"We had a great stay in Pacific Grove. The house was in great order an excellent kitchen living and dining etc. all perfectly appointed. Lovely comfy beds and linen too! A great position for walking out to Lovers Point and the beachfront. The Town is quaint and peacefull and we wish we had been there longer. Thank you Barbara
Bill and family"
1721186,16783765,2014-08-02,15247667,Eric,"Barb was an excellent host. She worked with us in aligning a viable date for our visit. Once we were connected, she provided clear, detailed instructions for the stay, and she followed up personally (via email, phone and text) to be sure we had everything that we needed. 

The Villa was just as beautiful and comfortable as advertised. The home's details are quite amazing- countertops, floors, fireplace, beds, spa-tub, and secluded patio are just some of the premium touches. 

The space is built for comfort with soft, warm furnishings. It's a cozy space, but more than enough room for myself, my wife and two kids. 

We had a very relaxing and memorable stay- our only wish is that we had more time off!"
1721186,17998974,2014-08-20,14602813,Marianne,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we weren't sure what to expect - but Barb's lovely, charming beachside villa was the perfect introduction to our California trip. Beautifully positioned and spotlessly clean, it was a hit with myself, my husband and 2 kids. Barb was a very thoughtful host and we would be more than happy to recommend this property to anyone wanting a great experience of Monterey. "
1721186,20852264,2014-10-06,18163826,Eric,"Barb and her beautiful home helped make our experience in Pacific Grove one that we will never forget. The villa was even more charming than the pictures convey. Very cozy, yet luxurious, from the top-of-the line kitchen to the patio out back where we enjoyed our dinner. 

The location cannot be beat. Literally steps away from Lover's Point beach, and a 20-minute walk along the coast to the aquarium. There is clearly much more to explore as well, but we will have to get to that next time. 

Overall, a fantastic experience with first-class hospitality. We will definitely be coming back in the near future! "
1721186,21197878,2014-10-13,18037128,Wanzi,"这真是一处非常棒的海景别墅!房子比图片中显示的要更温馨 更舒适,而且真的离海就隔一条马路而已!Barb也是非常棒的房主 没有见面 但处处有邮件提示,感恩!"
1721186,24582066,2014-12-31,21563900,Kim En,"The location was unbeatable, being a stone's throw from Lovers Point, yet quiet and comfortable. As a host, Barb was super efficient and helpful."
1721186,25618851,2015-01-20,26085686,Judy,"This is a lovely house in an ideal location; it's beautifully furnished while being comfortable. We had a wonderful weekend stay and would stay here again.
It's right across the street from Lovers' Point, and our kids thoroughly enjoyed this easy access to climbing on the rocks. It's a nice walk to the Aquarium.
Barb sent us a map with helpful info about favorite restaurants and attractions near the house; we referred to this often before and during our trip. She also provided detailed operating instructions for the house, which were handy in using the fireplace and navigating unfamiliar appliances. :)
We didn't get a chance to meet Barb in person but easily coordinated by text and email, and hope to meet her on a future visit."
1721186,26084416,2015-02-02,1628797,Gene,"Loved this place!! Barb was super responsive ( like within minutes ) each time I had a question.

the house was newly remodeled, very cozy. the kitchen was stocked with every pot/pan/kitchen widget imaginable. I had a great time making good use of the high quality stove and oven, as well as the grill out back. We also enjoyed the fire pit out in the back ( smores! ) as well as the gas fireplace in the living room.

The house really is a 10 second dash from the ocean ( one house away from the water ) - you can hear the waves."
1721186,26382967,2015-02-10,3037979,Antonio,"the apartment is awesome! good located, just in front of the ocean even if you cannot see it from the house because it's kind of 5 minutes walking. There are two rooms and in very nice couch, nice solution for a family or a group of friends!"
1721186,26688788,2015-02-17,26117605,Omer,"This lovely villa was a great long-weekend getaway for my family! The location is just great and the villa is very beautiful. Nearby you’ll find great restaurants, bike/beach rentals, and a grocery store for your basic needs. And Barb was a great host and was very responsive. She thought out almost every detail and provided great details about the villa and Pacific Grove. Thank you Barb! "
1721186,26790645,2015-02-19,14419810,Brad,"Barb and her husband were great. Super accommodating and helpful. She was sick so couldn't meet us on arrival but went above and beyond to be in touch and helpful with dining and other recommendations, and proactively checked in w us multiple times during our stay. A terrific host. 

The house is a delight. Super warm/friendly/cozy and immaculately appointed. They've put a lot of thought into the place and it shows. It is WAY better than the pictures make it look, for sure. Great kitchen - we almost wished we had planned to cook a meal in because the kitchen was so good. 

We had 4 adults & 2 kids. It was a bit of a squeeze w that crowd, but not bad. Esp w the lovely back patio, where we enjoyed one night by the fire pit. 

Location was great - a mile from the aquarium along a lovely coastal path. A few blocks from the shops & restaurants of Pacific Grove. A stones throw from the beach. Mind you, not the sort of beach you'll want to put a towel down and spend the day, but certainly a good place to get your feet wet and let kids play. 

All in all, we loved it and would happily go back!"
1721186,27089461,2015-02-25,24868744,Lynn,"Fantastic house - beautiful finishes and comfy beds.  Great location - in the middle of everything!  The house is just steps from the ocean and a few blocks from downtown Pacific Grove which has great restaurants, shops, and local grocery.  

Barb was available and very willing to help us with questions on the area and the house.  Almost like a built in tour guide.  

If we visit the area, we will definitely be staying in this house again.  "
1721186,27193345,2015-02-27,27784258,Long,Perfect! But expensive!
1721186,28399776,2015-03-23,6074326,Dwight And Kathy,"What a spectacular place this is. It's elegant, it's well-equipped, and it is steps away from the waterfront. Our stay involved two couples and the accommodations worked beautifully, with two comfortable bedrooms. Plus there is a secluded patio that lured us for a couple of hours of reading and sipping wine. (Gee, wish we were there now....)"
1721186,31912383,2015-05-11,22120645,Vanessa," Best rental in the area, hands down.  We come to Pacific Grove every year so have stayed in quite a few homes right around Lover's Point.  The other homes were nice but Barbara's house was the most comfortable for our family of four and in the absolute best location just across from the beach.  The pics don't do it justice, it's tastefully appointed, surprisingly spacious and free of bric-a-brac. There's a light-filled living room, a pro kitchen for those of us that enjoy cooking, a jacuzzi tub big enough for an army and a fire pit we put to good use once the kids were in bed.  We look forward to our next visit!"
1721186,33246358,2015-05-26,29898040,Tony,Great house and location!!  Truly a great escape.  We loved it and would go again.  
1721186,34481029,2015-06-08,16975254,Andrew,"The home was in a perfect location right next to beach access and shops.  Very comfy for a family of 3, even with a toddler. Love the bbq area in the back yard and fireplace in the main living area. Very short drive to the Aquarium as well. "
1721186,34938676,2015-06-14,27589581,Carmel,Beautiful neighborhood. Lovely lovely home. Barb was wonderful and kept in contact with me the day we arrived letting me know we could check in a little early. 
1721186,40431673,2015-07-31,29474220,Amy,"This is truly a beautiful and lovely Spanish villa! The decor is so modern and elegant, while stepping inside makes us feel cozy and we can really relax, read or watch tv, enjoy family time together. The beautiful kitchen is well-equipped with everything we ever needed and we had our home-made dinners there every day. The best part I love is the easy access to the ocean front ! Kids went there almost every afternoon. With just steps away I never worried about dragging muddy kids around in chilly wind. They had fun, came back and cleaned up. So fun and easy !
All in all, it's a perfect and memorable vacation home. 
Thank you very much, dear Barb!"
1721186,47593093,2015-09-20,41411967,Giovanni,"This home was absolutely lovely! So much so, that we decided to stay an extra day just to enjoy it for a bit longer. Barb was easy to contact and quick to respond. Access into the home was very easy. The pictures actually don't do justice for this home. It was THE cleanest and best kept AirBnB I have ever stayed at. I would not hesitate to recommend Barb and this property. "
1721186,47849071,2015-09-21,14062301,Muthu,"The house was good. But the whole experience of booking was painful.  And the cancellation policy was too strict. We had a last minute addition to our group, but the host was strict about not adding one guest. We were even ready to pay extra money. So we had to book a separate hotel for the extra person. Will not recommend this place. "
1721186,49763460,2015-10-06,25899299,Stefanie,"Its was a beautiful house near the beach in that we could live for two days. It was all clean and neat. We found everything that we need. There were two really nice fireplaces.

In the end I can say it´s a really lovely house and we are really glad that we could be there and we would come back every time."
1721186,50023185,2015-10-08,7809750,Dana,Barb did an amazing job communicating from start to finish.  Her home is perfect and the location is better than I could have ever imagined.  When we first arrived there was a farmers market going on down the street and we ate the most amazing pizza and picked up some fresh produce. The house was one of the cleanest Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. We really enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back. 
1721186,54117851,2015-11-16,9132203,Neha,We stayed at Barb's beautiful villa during a girls spa weekend we had. The house is gorgeous and right across the street from the ocean.  The villa itself is lovely - the 6 of us fit perfectly. The fireplace is was just perfect for the cool evenings and the kitchen is well stocked with plateware. We hope to be back next year! Barb herself was very helpful an accommodating -  she even let us check out late on sunday. 
1721186,54940471,2015-11-25,1574901,Ben,"House is beautiful - excellent location across the street from the beach, pictures very true to reality. Barb was easy to deal with, very enjoyable stay."
1721186,59932310,2016-01-17,52723713,William,"The home was beautiful.  Literally across the street from the ocean, lover beach.  The host was very attentive and checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. A great place/location and perfect for our visit."
1721186,60997906,2016-01-30,55731747,Dan,We had a great experience at the Villa and the house was as nice as described. Barb was very easy to work with and quick to respond to any questions we had.  We would definitely stay in the Villa again! 
1721186,63280167,2016-02-21,14383309,Zeynep,"It was a very lovely, cozy house with a great taste in interior design. Barbara is very responsive and really wants you to have an amazing time there! We can not wait to go there again. "
1721186,65539708,2016-03-15,39720094,Nancy,"We loved staying in this absolutely charming cottage just steps from Lover's Point! I'm from the area and was traveling back with girlfriends -- I feel like I should give a ""locals"" plug for this place in case you are traveling to the area for the first time: you won't find a better spot, and Barb couldn't have been more patient, accommodating, or hospitable. Even though we never met, I'd say my interactions with her were more like a hostess at a B&B than an owner on (Hidden by Airbnb) . Five stars! "
1721186,66489170,2016-03-22,11399161,Yukari,Barbara is an amazing host! She really takes care of her guests. I never met her in person but the way she communicated and responded quickly was very comforting to know that she was always there to answer any questions. I really enjoyed her recommendations to the local stores and restaurants. Her instructions left in the house were very clear and simple. Her house was just perfect. We loved the fact that Lover's Point was literally right outside the door. My family enjoyed staying here and wished we had more time to stay. My 4 year old son asked if this could be our new home. That's how much we enjoyed staying in Barbara's house. Thank you for the amazing experience in your lovely home!
1721186,67698430,2016-03-30,13211355,Johnny,"The place is just as described, it's a beautiful place right next to the beach. Location is amazing, also next to shops and attractions. The space was designed for conversation. Lovely living room with a fireplace and plenty of seating as well as a backyard with a fire pit. We had a great time making meals and connecting with each other on our getaway so much we didn't leave the house. It really felt like a home away from home. 

Barb was very attentive to us and answered questions / concerns that we had before, during, and after our stay. 

Parking was plentiful for a place that was so close to the beach since it was a bit away from the main part of town. So if you are looking for a quiet getaway with a cozy space, this is the place to do it."
1721186,69430546,2016-04-11,13549188,Keng Fun,"Great communication by the host - very accommodating - she agreed to share the cost of cleaning mid way through our stay.  The house is great - location is unbeatable and the condition of the house, rooms, electronics, heating, bathroom excellent. It was so nice we wanted to buy it.  Pity we didn't have time to enjoy her grill in the backyard. "
1721186,69684866,2016-04-12,13684027,Sally,"Barb was very accommodating and went out of her way to make our stay in Monterey as pleasant as possible. She was very quick to respond to any questions.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time and look forward to visiting again.
Sally"
1721186,72213147,2016-05-01,7730300,Brad,"What a beautiful home in an absolutely perfect location! We had such a wonderful time, and Barbara did everything possible to make our stay easy and hassle free. I highly recommend this fantastic spot for enjoying Pacific Grove and Monterey -- we are already planning our return!"
1721186,73523435,2016-05-08,10676304,Scott,"This place was fantastic, and everything was as described. it's romantic,  close to everything and family-friendly. We did need to use uber a few times back and forth from cannery row, but we walked a few times (usually one way to the aquarium/cannery row, then uber back) but we could see otters just a few steps away from the front porch, which was pretty amazing. The home has some very special rennovations and feels like our own vacation home, and we would definitely stay here again."
1721186,74048786,2016-05-12,11644681,Thorsteinn,Very nice house with everything you need and good location.
1721186,75833248,2016-05-23,906480,Guy,"Lovely, clean, well maintained, perfect location, layout and backyard. "
1721186,76349700,2016-05-26,44396962,Melanie,"Place is great! Everything as described. Can tell owners put a lot of time and money into the place with quality product (doors, windows, faucet, bath, etc. etc.)  So close to everything.  Kids loved the access to the beach/rocks/park that was a few minutes walk away.  Had excellent communication with the host. Host had very helpful visitor information.  Would stay there again!"
1721186,76897739,2016-05-29,997822,Adrian,"Barb is a gracious host with a beautiful home. 
The location is amazing, just steps away from the beach. 
We had a wonderful experience and look forward to our next visit. "
1721186,77713846,2016-06-03,26978078,Chase,Place was just how it pictured. Great host as well. Everything was perfect and would stay again! 
1721186,78843683,2016-06-09,30375344,Zach,"Great place, very welcoming. Well furnished and comfortable. Located 2 minutes from the sand.

Will definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises!

The hose (Barb) was extremely responsive, helpful and attentive.

All the best,
Zach"
1721186,83689041,2016-07-03,8816097,Lee,"Barbara was a very accommodating host and has a lovely home in an amazing location.  We really enjoyed the back patio with the fire pit.  You can see the Monterey Bay from the house, and it was very nice being able to walk down to the water in just seconds and see otters and seals playing.  The Pacific Grove neighborhood is more quaint than Monterey but still has plenty of options for dining and entertainment."
1721186,86779145,2016-07-17,73182185,Claire,"Barbara was very responsive to my queries and organized. She also provided great suggestions for nearby restaurants & stores to make our stay more comfortable, which was very much appreciated.  While I had originally requested a different listing of hers, this place was really wonderful & felt warm & welcoming. The neighborhood was quiet and residential but really nice. It was very close to Lovers Point & surrounding beach area, which was great. Very happy with our stay here!"
1721186,93682616,2016-08-13,66594135,Ronald,We received information about the house and about our stay well ahead of time. Barb was clearly on top of her emails and responded promptly. The house itself and the location were just as described in the listing (great!). 
1721186,97940975,2016-08-29,355810,Cliff,"We loved this cozy, comfy house. It's in a great location and Barb is a terrific host—friendly, efficient, and organized. We're already planning to stay here again next summer!"
1721186,100556149,2016-09-09,5153705,Marilyn,"Barb was very kind to let us book her beautiful home, less than a hundred yards away from Pacific Grove's Lovers Point, for 2 nights. It was the best 2 nights of vacation that we could ever hope for (my guests, a family of 4, came all the way from South East Asia to visit us). Her house was perfectly clean, neat, and tidy, with fresh towels in the bathroom and crisp linens in the bedroom. Her kitchen is even more well-stocked than my own kitchen (and that's impressive considering the amount of cooking I do at home). The backyard fire pit was perfect for toasting marshmallow well into the night, and of course the fireplace in the living room to warm you up when the foggy Pacific hits Monterey. But at the end of the day, nothing beats the location of this house. Lovers' Point is literally in front of your door, and the aquarium is a lovely 20 minutes' walk away along the coast. I've never known a host as gracious and generous as Barb. She has surely raised the bar pretty high for any of our future Airbnb stay."
1721186,104181362,2016-09-25,330979,Angel Parker,"Lots of info, great support. "
1721186,108859088,2016-10-17,36454101,Tim,Great location and ideal for easy access to the Monterey Aquarium and other unique Pacific coast parks. The beach park and walking path along the water is just 100 yards from the house. Pictures provided on the website are accurate for the layout and look inside and out. 
1721186,109012172,2016-10-18,75469541,Aaron,Great location. Well maintained. Very charming style. 
1721186,109461078,2016-10-21,4744132,Melissa,"The house is absolutely gorgeous -- and the location is top notch! All the finishes and decor are great. Understandably, you need to be more mindful of the wood floors & counter top, but that's acceptable considering you're staying in a high-end finished home. The living room furniture (and beds) are incredibly comfortable & relaxing.

There are adorable little shops & cafes are within a short walk to Forest Hills, and the walk into town is totally manageable (I was with a 69 & 78 year old).

Barb was excellent at communication, pleasant to deal with, and very welcoming. There was a minor hiccup with check-in and picking up the key, but she was instantly ""on it"" to remedy the situation. 

For light sleepers, folks might be bothered by some of the road noise since you're street level (really just individual loud cars at times and garbage truck for trash pickup), but it's not a steady stream of traffic. I live on the 3rd floor in an apt complex, so I'm not used to road noise -- this may be why I was more sensitive to it. "
1721186,109927358,2016-10-23,28236317,Keng,"Wow what a gorgeous house! I was a little worried it would be too small for us (4 adults/2 toddlers) but Barb has this place well stocked. She had an air mattress (actually comfortable!) and a pack-n-play, a huge bonus for those with kids. The house was updated with newer appliances. Barb communicated well before our arrival, and checkin was simple and easy. The street was quiet, even though we were steps from the beach. Perfect pacific grove location! "
1721186,112805443,2016-11-07,70385665,Samuel,"It had been 35 years since the last time my wife and I were in Monterey. We met each other while in the Army studying foreign languages at the Presidio. I was looking for a special place for us to enjoy our trip back to celebrate the 75th anniversary of DLI. Barb's lovely villa in Pacific Grove proved to be the perfect choice! Everything was in working order and clean, and there were no funky smells either. The pictures are accurate but the place looks even better in person. I could move into the home tomorrow and not change a thing. It is gorgeous. The living room was comfortable and we got a good night's sleep on the beds. The private courtyard out back is beautiful with gas grill, wood burning fire pit, dining table and chairs and extra seating. We enjoyed spending some time out there. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you would need to cook a full blown dinner or big morning breakfast.  And there was a full size coffee pot!

Barb wasn't able to meet us when we arrived, but she provided the code to the key lock box and we had no problem getting inside.  When we had questions about something she was always very responsive and easy to contact either by phone, text or email. 

The house is in a great spot, very close to the bay and the walking and bike trail. We felt very safe there, but then again,  I don't know if there are any bad neighborhoods in Pacific Grove, we didn't see any! We explored the entire Monterey Peninsula and Barb's home was a great base, right in the middle of everything we wanted to see - whale watching, Monterey Aquarium, Fisherman's Wharf, Lovers Point, Monarch Butterfly preserve, Asilomar Beach, 17 Mile Drive, Pebble Beach, Carmel, Big Sur.....WOW!

We like renting houses/condos vs. hotels. I don't need my bed made for me everyday and I can go a few days without having my towels replaced.  If we want some coffee in the morning, in a hotel you usually have to get dressed to go find some. We could just crawl out of bed here and pour a cup and sit around relaxing in our pjs! Another party travelled with us so splitting the cost made it cheaper than most hotels in town. And while we didn't make full blown dinners(too many wonderful places to eat nearby), having some breakfast food on hand helped us save time and $$, further making our stay affordable.

To sum this up, Barb's place is wonderful. It is as advertised and in a superb location (parking is easy) and now that we've stayed there, we wouldn't hesitate to go back...and neither should anyone considering her property. "
1721186,113134597,2016-11-10,19064142,Miranda,My husband and I stayed with our 3 small children and we all loved the place. My husband keeps talking about staying again! It's a cute little house right next to the beach and just about everything else is within walking distance. We drove to the aquarium which is only about a mile away but besides that we walked everywhere during our stay. We were there on a Monday night and a farmers market was going on about a block away next to the natural history museum. We got some great food there for our stay and my kids enjoyed running around the grass there with about 20 other kids who were playing tag. So cute. The host was quick with all conversations and very helpful.
1721186,115430652,2016-11-24,5652486,Alice,The house is bright and warm with a nice gas fireplace.  Wonderful location close to the beach where my kids picked shells and climbed on rocks and has a place to rent kayak and bikes.  Also walking distance to nice cafes and a great base to see Monterey and Carmel. The house is super clean and tastefully decorated.  Very relaxing to sit in the backyard with lovely plants all around.
1721186,116685234,2016-12-02,457929,Kathy,"Barbara was a wonderful host!  She was so quick in responding to any request or question and all my interactions with her were fantastic.

The location of this house is ideal.  Staying near downtown Pacific Grove, on the ocean side is the best location.  You can walk to shops and restaurants, such as Pavel's Backerei, Red House Cafe and Aliotti's Victorian Corner.  The aquarium is a mile away and you can use the Coastal Trail, which is a gorgeous walkway along the ocean.  Also, Caledonia Park is a couple of blocks away, which is fantastic for people traveling with young children.  The house is located across the street from Lovers Point and we went there to play on the little beach.  Finally, on one of the nights we stayed, we walked 3 blocks to Lighthouse Avenue and watched Pacific Grove's holiday parade of lights.  

The house is incredible.  The entire house is very warm and inviting.  It was wonderfully remodeled in the Californian-Spanish style, maintaining lots of architectural detail, including archways and even the front door is arched!  The wood floors are gorgeous and consistent throughout the house and there are lots of big rugs to keep your feet warm.  The kitchen is beautiful with dark butcher board countertops, a big sink, a steel oven and all the necessary equipment to cook and serve meals.  

We used the fireplace every night, which was fantastic as it was cold most nights while we were in Pacific Grove, and the fire made the living room so warm and cozy.  The heat also worked really well.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large and clean.

Overall, this was such a wonderful stay and our new standard for airbnb rentals. "
1721186,122925476,2016-12-26,19381151,Yifan,"Barbara was a great host! Communication was great, she always replied in a timely fashion. The villa is located in a wonderful location only steps away from the ocean! The place was clean and tidy; well-equiped with all kinds of kitchenware and spices. We had a great time! "
1721186,132402807,2017-02-17,75061336,Terra,We are two mommies headed back to work from maternity leave and enjoyed private time in Barb's comfy home near the ocean. Our infant enjoyed the sunny patio and beach trail strolls. Very low key mid week just the right pace for our family. Five stars!
1721186,136977141,2017-03-12,11375464,Michael,"The perfect getaway.  We arrived and never moved the car.  Couldnt be a better location.  Brewed coffee and played in the sand with our 1 year old while the wife slept in.  Walked everywhere, covering all the gems of Monterrey.  It's not cheap, but very high value"
1721186,137653725,2017-03-16,119114419,Shuting,Definitely a great place to stay in pacific grove!
1721186,141310415,2017-04-02,5685893,Sarah,We are a family of 4 and we had an absolutely lovely stay at Barbara's beach house. The place is very well decorated and had all that we needed. We loved and made use of the amazing kitchen. But you can't beat it's location to the the beach/Lover's cove just right down there street.  The 2nd bedroom is a bit small but the teenagers did just fine in there. We highly recommend it and would stay again. 
1721186,141937060,2017-04-05,86353550,Chris And Lori,"Beautiful house, great location, very clean and comfortable!"
1721186,142905355,2017-04-09,122105440,Carl,"We had a great time - only wish it could have been longer. It had everything we needed. We did the aquarium and the 17 mile pebble beach drive down to Carmel. Dinner was a short walk to Fandango. 
Only down side was that we missed the third bed is an inflatable and it only fits in the front room. The kids weren't comfortable sleeping by themselves by and he front door so it wasn't optimal for sleeping for us and the dining table was a squeeze for 6. "
1721186,150366954,2017-05-07,29710425,Fernando,"The location is great and the house is very clean and nicely remodeled with high-end appliances. Everything you want is walkable distance (groceries, restaurants, aquarium, beach, etc). It was a pleasure to stay in Barb's house to enjoy Monterey area."
1721186,155234784,2017-05-27,22136980,Bao,Love the location. A few steps to the beach. Very peaceful and quiet neighborhood. House was very clean. Barb was very responsive. Thanks for being a great host.
1721186,156180044,2017-05-29,45164369,Ariel,"We had a wonderful time spending the weekend at Barb's apartment. She was excellent at communicating and sent us all the instructions in advance so check in was seamless. The home is clean, beautifully decorated, and you can't beat the location. The house is steps from the beach and a short drive into Carmel. The backyard was the perfect hangout spot with a bbq and bonfire. I would recommend this place to friends and definitely would stay again."
1721186,157859860,2017-06-04,131633002,Garrett,Awesome house. Awesome location.  Awesome Stay. Thanks again Barbara.
1721186,161308418,2017-06-17,120143434,Greg,Nice place in a great location 
1721186,163973587,2017-06-25,127096669,Ben,This is a wonderfully cared for home that is in a prime location next to the beach.  The host was very kind and accommodating and extremely responsive. This was our first trip to the Monterey area and this was the perfect place for our family. We definitely look forward to more trips to this location in the future. 
1721186,174382228,2017-07-25,134931113,Lily,"Had a great stay,very cute house,  very clean and great location by the ocean. Will come back to visit again!"
1721186,182006557,2017-08-13,85894808,Linda,"We loved Barbara's house, it was charming, cozy and located right across from the ocean.  It was walking distance to restaurants, and close to Carmel by the Sea.  We would highly recommend this house."
1721186,187272589,2017-08-26,22729630,Alyssa,"This house was in a wonderful location! We walked nearly everywhere. Loved the back patio. Barbara was very responsive. My family of three had a great time! Thanks, Barbara!"
1721186,191256229,2017-09-06,114061489,Collette,We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Barb's place. Can't wait to go back again.
1721186,196627980,2017-09-23,97010499,Brian,Had a great few days at Barb's house. The location is superb and an ideal base to walk / cycle around the area or chill out by the sea. Accommodation is really comfortable and suits two couples perfectly.
1721186,199355837,2017-10-01,144664756,Jeff,Beautiful place in a perfect setting so close to lovers point . Great for a couple or two.
1721186,200256443,2017-10-04,150819218,Mark,"Terrific location and comfortable for myself, my wife, our grown son, and our toddler. Our toddler is transitioning out of a crib to his own bed, and he ended up sleeping comfortably on the couch in the front room. To make sure that went well, we inflated the air mattress in the living room so we could be next to him while the older son took the second bedroom. It worked out great for all of us. We spent much time walking around the shops in the nearby downtown area and along the hike/bike path near the water."
1721186,200808025,2017-10-06,33307933,Stefan,Barbara's place was truly amazing! Steps away from the beach and great restaurants! Barb also provided recommendations that were spot on! I only wish we could have stayed longer!
1721186,201698016,2017-10-08,9573738,Sofia,"My family and I loved our stay at Barb's place! It was just the right size for the five of us, and beautifully decorated with lots of nice touches like the fire pit and chairs in the garden, and cosy blankets on the sofa. The house is also very well located for strolling around Lovers Point, walking to the Monterey aquarium, or to restaurants and cafes nearby. Communication with Barb was very easy and she was very sweet and friendly. Highly recommend!"
1721186,205782450,2017-10-22,154130916,William,Beautiful home. Great Location. Gracious Hostess. Triple Play! Right at Lover's Point for memorable seaside walks. Easy walking access to restaurants and services. Barbara responded quickly to our messages. This one's a winner!
1721186,211359602,2017-11-12,156915969,Josh,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Literally a walk across the road to the beach, restaurants within walking distance, nice area!  This was our first Airbnb experience at it was great. We had a slight hiccup getting in, the key wasn't in the box. Left a message for Barb, she called back within 5 mins, had to make a call to find out what happened. Basically it was just a mix up, she had a key delivered about 30 mins later. Not as big of deal because of the LOCATION, my daughter and wife went on a walk by the ocean while I waited for the key. Barb offered free passes to the Aquarium and let us check out a little later on Sunday to make up for the delay getting in. The only reason I am including it in the review is to point out that if there is an issue it will be handled professionally and in a timely manner. I found the instructions she delivers to be very helpful, the (Hidden by Airbnb) doc with recommendations and locations was great. The house is very nice, it's not very large but perfect for a getaway. The pictures are very accurate, the courtyard is nice, the beds were comfortable. The front room is great for relaxing and enjoying the fire! The Wi-fi worked great. The bathroom did not have shampoo, conditioner, or bar soap. Not that they were promised, just a note for other Airbnbers in case you don't typically travel with such things. We brought our own anyway so it wasn't an issue. Oh and if you have a large vehicle the driveway is very narrow. We have a Toyota Rav4 Hybrid and I had to let the passengers out before we pulled in because really you can only get out on one side. If you had a large SUV it might prove difficult to fit.  I don't think I can say much more. Thank you to Barb for opening up their home, if she will have us we will probably visit again in the future! Thanks again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1721186,213720506,2017-11-22,130573880,Margaret,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Barbara’s house in PG. It is beautifully decorated, cozy and comfortable. Lovely back patio garden. The location was great. We visited with our 5 year old. She loved climbing on the rocky point just across the street. The walk to the aquarium was easy and beautiful- seals and sea otters along the way. The same bike path made for gorgeous morning runs.  The weekly farmer’s market was just two blocks away, local grocery store 3 blocks. Communication, check in and check out went smoothly.  Could not have done better!"
1721186,227421402,2018-01-14,144468631,Ryan,"Barbara's home is in an excellent location, nearby Pacific Grove's downtown and steps from the ocean.  Overall PG is a convenient and more relaxed location to go around Carmel and Monterey.  The home has been renovated and decorated very nicely and the place is super clean and neat.  The house is well organized for visitors, everything down to kitchen essentials and even a sewing kit.  Barbara is very responsive to every need and question and a fun host.  Only downside is one night is never enough in this area, stay two or three nights!"
1721186,231151741,2018-01-30,9881013,Chris,"Fantastic location! Barb's place was great for my group of 4. Close to the water as well as coffee shops, restaurants, a grocery store, etc. Everything was very clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed a backyard BBQ with the grill and fire pit. Highly recommended!"
1721186,237901095,2018-02-24,130274417,Ben,"We traveled as a party of five, including our five year old and grandparents.  This a great location and certainly family friendly.  We had a great time at the beach and I would not hesitate to visit again!"
1721186,238440787,2018-02-25,71556462,Bryant,"We stayed in Barb's house for just 1 night and had a great time. The location is amazing, right next to Lover's point and a short walk to restaurants and shops in Pacific Grove. The house itself was very clean, comfortable, and features beautiful wooden counters and floors. We especially enjoyed grilling and sitting around the fire pit outside. Barb was very responsive, welcoming, and has clearly put a lot of work into her house. As a result, she cares deeply about her home, and I would not recommend staying here if plan on having parties. The high-end fixtures require a little more care and maintenance than your typical Airbnb. For example, water should not be left on the floors or countertops after showering or cooking. However, if you are looking for a nice place to relax and explore, Barb's home is a great option!"
1721186,239683318,2018-03-02,171420474,Bridget,"Perfect location on the ocean in Pacific Grove, a beautiful and easy walk to the Monterey Aquarium.  Comfortable, elegant space. The hosts are responsive."
1721186,250967821,2018-04-06,176501648,Andrew,"Photos do not do the interior justice. I am an interior designer and I would not have changed a thing, very stylish and yet homely too. 30 second walk to beach. Nice quiet location. Good restaurant 1 minute walk. Great little secluded sandy beach. Also up the hill from the villa is a really nice village, then further up same road big supermarkets. Perfect"
1721186,254044314,2018-04-15,62704684,Heidi,We had the pleasure of a weekend getaway in this beautifully decorated extremely clean and quiet villa located feet from Lovers Point. It’s a few minutes walk to the center of PG as well. Our family of six felt right at home and so relaxed. Our host Barbara was so sweet. We hope to make it back again some day. I highly recommend you won’t be disappointed.
1909416,9033343,2013-12-02,4752695,Micah,"The Steinbeck Cottage is an ideal place to rest and relax in Pacific Grove / Monterey. I highly recommend it!

My wife, 2yo son and I stayed here over Thanksgiving. We spent our days out exploring and our evenings and morning at the Cottage. 

The Cottage itself is impeccably decorated, sunny, and cozy. Our small family was extremely comfortable. Once my son was in bed, my wife and I enjoyed sitting in front of the fireplace relaxing with a glass of wine. I even did some writing on a book draft I'm working on, which is hugely fun to think of doing when Steinbeck was living their after publishing The Grapes of Wrath and sailing around Monterey. 

With regards to the location, it was an easy walk down to the Aquarium, a 5 minute drive to either downtown Monterey or Pacific Grove, and only a 15 minute drive to Carmel. It would be hard to top the location unless you were right on the beach.

Finally, Amy was a pleasure to deal with, answered all of our questions, and made the rental process very easy. We wished all of hosts were as accommodating. 

End of the day, we would love to come back to Pacific Grove again and would probably try and rent the cottage again. It really was perfect. "
1909416,9678797,2014-01-05,4537674,Rob And Sonya,"As lovely as the photos.  Warm and inviting, the outside fire pit was an unexpected treat.  Amy was very friendly and had everything completely organised, highly recommend."
1909416,9960643,2014-01-21,3228820,Denny,My wife and absolutely loved the Steinbeck Cottage. It was a beautiful place in a great location and was well equipped. We look forward to staying here again.
1909416,10272229,2014-02-10,11406925,Leemarie,We absolutely loved staying here!!  We did not want to leave.  Amy has decorated this cottage beautifully.  We could not get over the amazing attention to detail.  The location is great - we were able to walk to town and to Lover's Point.  Would highly recommend and would love to go back!  Great for a romantic getaway.  
1909416,10425053,2014-02-18,11313057,Kjersti,"The Steinbeck Cottage was the perfect get away!  The aesthetic's of the decor really make the home feel relaxing and sophisticated.  The kitchen has everything you need to cook and there are plenty of blankets and towels, making it so you can pack light, but still have everything you need.  It is a really nice place to stay.  "
1909416,10588602,2014-02-26,11380718,Andrew,"Arrived late on a Sunday afternoon after a drive up through Big Sur. the cottage is very nice and is close to a Trader Joes, and is definitely within walking distance to cannery row and the aquarium. There were no problems using the provided guest passes for the World Famous Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the kitchen in the cottage is well outfitted with everything you would need except for groceries. Even coffee was there in the kitchen. A great place to stay in Pacific Grove. "
1909416,10837900,2014-03-10,4804284,Cameron,Amy was very professional and helpful throughout the entire booking process and through the duration of our stay. I would definitely rent from her again.
1909416,11014974,2014-03-17,1789342,Allison,"What a perfectly lovely cottage and fabulous place to stay!

Amy was extremely responsive throughout the booking process. She has collected a bunch of helpful pamphlets including restaurant guides and information on local attractions. The welcome binder is complete with easy to follow instructions and the whole place was impeccably clean and cozy when we arrived late Friday evening.

We were totally delighted by the charm of the place. The artwork, the very functional gas fireplace, the cool furniture, and fabulous smelling linens. 

The cottage is very well located. You walk out the front door and are greeted by a view of the ocean and an easy 1/2 mile walk to the Aquarium. What a perk to have 2 guest passes included in the stay! We spent our first day making friends with the octopus and the rest of it walking along the waterfront and eating delectable sea foods. 

Our only regret was not spending more time enjoying the cottage itself!"
1909416,11215690,2014-03-25,64349,Ryan,"We had a great long weekend in the very lovely Steinbeck Cottage. It was a very quick drive to downtown Monterey, where we were attending a conference, and it was even quicker to quaint downtown Pacific Grove, the aquarium (we made use of the free passes that come with the cottage), and lover's beach. The cottage is beautifully decorated and very clean."
1909416,11370136,2014-03-31,6355459,Jasmin,"We had a great stay at the Steinbeck cottage. It's lovely, quiet and well situated. The kitchen had everything we needed. The aquarium passes were a bonus. Thank you!"
1909416,11740391,2014-04-14,5849254,Dylan,"While we never met Amy she was a wonderful host.  Everything was exactly as advertised.  The cottage was adorable, spotless, and very welcoming.  The fact that we never had to call Amy is a testament to how well run this rental is.  We used the two passes to the aquarium and ended up saving ourselves $60.  For runners, the cottage is a half mile from the coast trail which goes for many miles in both directions and can keep you going for a dozen miles if you are so inclined.  We stayed there with our 20 month old baby and it worked well (although we had to take some things out of his reach when we first got there).  Overall a great stay."
1909416,12123747,2014-04-23,1000867,Claire,"Myself, my partner, and my mother in-law stayed at the Steinbeck Cottage and we can't say enough good things about the space and the magical Pacific Grove area. The aquarium passes are such a bonus, do NOT miss the Monterey Bay Aquarium, it is truly amazing. The cottage itself was spotless, charming, quiet and perfectly located. The fire and heater did a great job heating up the rooms when needed. The kitchen was fully stocked and we made good use of it to cook local CA produce and drink local wine. Amy ensures you have lots of info on the area attractions, restaurants, and cafes, and she is very responsive. My mother in-law had some mobility issues and the cottage was easy to navigate. It was a very special trip for us, especially for my mother in-law who was ill. Unfortunately she has since passed away (hence the late review) but mentioned to everyone she met how much she loved the cottage and that the Pacific Grove/Monterey sea breezes made her feel carefree and healthy. She also loved watching East of Eden and Cannery Row again! Thanks Amy, we hope to visit again one day."
1909416,13028633,2014-05-18,11579257,Elif,"If you want to save yourself a long read, here is the essence of our review: Do yourself a favour and stay at The Steinbeck Cottage and enjoy the best Monterey/Pacific Grove has to offer.

We spent four nights at The Steinbeck Cottage as part of our trip through California with our eight month old baby. While we did not meet Amy in person, she gave us the feeling of being welcome in the Cottage and Monterey nonetheless, providing very detailed information via e-mail in advance (a folder with additional information is in the Cottage itself). Check-in is very easy - all you need is the passcode to get the keys, so that if you are travelling through the state, there is no hurry to be there at a specific time.

The Steinbeck Cottage is the perfect symbiosis of modern and classic elements: a beautiful, quiet and spacious old house surrounded by a small garden, furniture and décor matched to the period in which John Steinbeck inhabited the house. At the same time, it is not lacking in the comfort you would expect from a home today. Take for example the kitchen, which has everything you might need to cook your own meals during your stay (which we did). 

All in all, the Cottage makes you feel at home from the moment you first see it, and we highly recommend to anyone to actually spend some time there during your stay (and not just use it as a home base for excursions). For example, during our stay, we often stayed in for a late breakfast, only leaving to explore Pacific Grove and Monterey around lunchtime.

With the Cottage, you have your own designated sitting areas in the garden (out front and back), and your only contact with anyone living in the other two Steinbeck houses will be that the guests staying at the Writers' Studio share the same entrance into the garden (and gravel path past the house), which is to say that you barely notice anyone else living on the premises.

The Cottage is located just uphill from Cannery Row and the Monterey Aquarium, for which Amy graciously provided guest passes (a visit to both is highly recommended!). You can easily walk to Monterey and Fisherman's Wharf (we recommend the excellent Abalonetti Bar & Grill for lunch) along the beachfront, enjoying the view and watching the seals and sea otters at play. There are various restaurants, cafés (check out Happy Girl Kitchen) and stores within walking distance. In addition, there is a Trader Joe's a few minutes away by car, and a Whole Foods in the Del Monte shopping center if you are looking for organic food. They also stock a wide selection of baby foods.

All in all, if we come back to Monterey, we will definitely stay at the Cottage again."
1909416,13289195,2014-05-24,15319998,Julien,"The Steinbeck Cottage was a great find on. AirBnB it turned into a great history lesson about the Monterey, Pacific Grove area. Amy has the house beautifully fitted out and we felt most comfortable during our stay. We would recommend the house to any potential guest. Amy was most helpful and friendly-  Cheers Julien  Adrienne and Angus."
1909416,13348932,2014-05-26,13488596,Jaimee,"My girlfriends and I just stayed at the The Steinback Cottage this past Memorial Day weekend and we had the most amazing time. This cottage is hands down the most adorable place I've ever stayed at through Airbnb. This cottage slept 4 of us very comfortably. The attention to detail in the rustic decorations were fascinating - this place seriously looked like a Pinterest board. My girlfriends and I had a hard time dragging ourselves out of this cozy cottage b/c we were thoroughly enjoying lounging around in this adorable place. The exterior of this cottage is just as adorable as the inside - with a cute back patio and fire pit in the front. And just when we thought this place couldn't be more perfect ... the location was AMAZING. We didn't have to drive anywhere all weekend with the beach, downtown Monterey and aquarium all within a 10-20 min walk from the cottage. The hostess Amy, is so friendly and accommodating. She was available for any questions leading up to our stay and was also very responsive during our stay. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend the Steinback Cottage to anyone looking to enjoy a nice relaxing weekend in Monterey. I would rate this place a 4/5 stars and plan on returning back for another enjoyable stay. Thank you Amy for making our girls weekend so special!

Thanks,
Jaimee Faith, Caitlin Common, Mary Sitler and Hilary Hilary McConaghy"
1909416,13475228,2014-05-28,10392665,Courtney,We had a wonderful visit to the magical Steinbeck Cottage. Very hard to leave the cozy setting even to venture out to the nearby beautiful vistas of the 17 Mile Drive. The aquarium passes were a big bonus. We also enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen for preparing some home-cooked meals during our visit. Many thanks for the relaxing getaway from the hectic pace of the modern world.
1909416,14194409,2014-06-14,15533482,Colleen,"We loved our stay at The Steinbeck Cottage!  The cottage itself is absolutely charming, and it was like a sightseeing experience in itself.  We enjoyed the information available about John Steinbeck when he owned the cottage, and the decorations around the place are so interesting and delightful.  Staying at The Steinbeck Cottage was our first experience with Airbnb and everything about it was great! We are so, so glad that we went this route over a traditional hotel, since the cottage added so much more to our Monterey stay and ideally suited our group.  Although the cottage is one bedroom, it never felt cramped as there is plenty of space.  Four of us stayed there easily.   
We cooked at the cottage and enjoyed some nice meals in the bright and pretty kitchen, and my daughter enjoyed reading curled up in a nook in the living room.  
The location is great, with quick access to the Monterey Aquarium.  We really appreciated the 2 passes to the aquarium that came with the stay and made good use of them. We had no trouble at all with parking on the street. 
Amy was really nice and a joy to work with.  She had all of the information available for our stay that we could possibly need.  A great host and our many thanks to Amy!  "
1909416,15132613,2014-07-03,13579972,Sharon,"Cottage is lovely, clean and neat.
It was a pleasure to have the luxury of a home-y feel rather than being confined in a hotel.  We sat in the yard at night and  by the fireplace in the morning.  We also enjoyed the walk to the aquarium and the Cannery area.

Would enjoy staying there again."
1909416,15771902,2014-07-15,16595533,Diane,"What a charming place!  My husband and I wanted a special location to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary, and this was perfect. Kevin has restored this historic gem into a delightful retreat. The cottage style decorating is cozy, comfortable and creative.  We kept noticing clever touches and appreciated the owner's attention to details. Kevin is a gracious host, and this is a wonderful spot for a simple weekend get-away or to celebrate a memorable occasion. "
1909416,15969129,2014-07-19,4992881,Meg,"A great cottage from which to explore everything Steinbeck - Salinas, the lovely Pacific Grove and Monterrey, the last 2 within easy walking distance. 
Cottage was charming and clean. Appreciated having the 2 Aquarium passes which was a $80 savings. Kitchen was well stocked  "
1909416,16358951,2014-07-26,8926151,John,"When we made our reservation, Amy was the host and was prompt and informative. A few weeks before our stay Kevin took over and did a GREAT job of making the transition seamless. I think it's safe to say that an ownership/management change could have made for some drama, so my hats off to Amy and Kevin for a well coordinated handoff.

The cabin! Charming, well-appointed and clean -- not to mention the history of the place. The pantry was well stocked, and the ""welcome kit"" provided enough information to get your bearings without being overly-stuffed with restaurant flyers and the like. The Aquarium passes were a major plus and we put them to good use!

The interior of the cottage is thoughtfully appointed. One of the reasons we booked (along with the history of the property) was the slant toward a contemporary take on rustic. Many of the properties we looked at were overly country-kitch.

And, on a more personal note, we ran into a little car trouble on the day of check-out, and Kevin was VERY accommodating in allowing us to hang out on the property until the car situation was sorted.

My only ding on this otherwise wonderful accommodation, and the reason for the 4-star review, would be the immediate neighborhood. It's in a pocket of Pacific Grove that lacks the charm of some of the landmarks I had in mind when making the reservation. For instance, Lovers Point with all of its Victorian and historical charm. I would say the Steinbeck Cottage is the highlight of this particular neighborhood. To be clear, this is not a *bad* neighborhood, but if you're wanting to take an early evening walk to take in the charm of old Pacific Grove you're going to want to drive and park a few blocks NW of the cottage.

Overall a wonderful time. The Cottage was a highlight of our extended trip up and down the coast."
1909416,16765257,2014-08-02,13552375,Louise,"This house is really beautiful, and we (a family of 5, with 3 teenagers) had a great couple of days stay here.  Kevin was always on hand to answer any emails very swiftly, and we had no problems at all with the house.  It was a perfect stopover with the aquarium literally a few blocks down the road.  We would love to have stayed longer, and would recommend this place highly to people."
1909416,17430756,2014-08-12,13422492,Alison,"We really loved the Steinbeck Cottage. We loved walking to the Aquarium and to Cannery Row to rent bicycles. In the cottage, we cooked several meals and enjoyed several quiet nights in front of the fireplace. Everyday we noticed some new, unique little thing in the cottage. It was a pleasure staying there and we would go back in a heartbeat."
1909416,17670490,2014-08-16,8963666,Damian,kevins cottage is simply wonderful. spotlessly clean and cosy is served our purpose perfectly. our young family loved discovering new nooks and crannies and of course the complimentary aquarium passes. thanks so much for allowing us the privilege of staying. a perfect base for us to explore beautiful pacific grove and carmel. 
1909416,18297225,2014-08-25,12335383,Mary,The cottage was fantastic. Larger than it seems on the pictures. The whole place was really comfortable. We loved all the interesting character detailing and features. It was an easy downhill walk to the aquarium and cannery row as well as local restaurants and a supermarket. Parking wad eaeasy too. Kevin responded quickly if we had any queries. We would love to come back again one day.
1909416,18795148,2014-09-01,17175080,George,"The Steinbeck cottage was, in the words of our 13 year old daughter, ""epic"".  She claimed the reading nook while we all explored the kitchen, bookshelves, and artwork.  The living room ceilings gently curve out at the base almost like a fairy cottage.  There is a great 5 mile run from the cottage down to the aquarium, along the bay, past the lighthouse, around the coast, then back thru Pacific Grove.  Would certainly recommend this for a relaxing retreat."
1909416,19076530,2014-09-06,7222731,Georgina,"Kevin is a great host! Everything was absolutely perfect - the little cottage was wonderful, so peaceful and cozy and in great walking distance to the beach. Kevin and his nice cottage get my highest recommendation. Thank you! "
1909416,19198216,2014-09-08,596612,Tim,"The Steinbeck cottage was a delightful place to stay. Kevin did a great job doing this place out. It's in a great location, walkable to the aquarium but out beyond the tourist traps. Highly recommended and would definitely return. "
1909416,19604380,2014-09-15,5078845,Kevin,extremely enjoyable cottage.  our best experience yet in monterey/pacific grove.  cant say enough about the fine attentionion to detail throughout the entire place.  we would like to return.
1909416,20075038,2014-09-22,15620928,Jack,"This place is really charming, and I mean it raises charming to a new level. Also spacious, inviting and a pleasure to stay there. The location is excellent for walkers as it's straight up the hill from the aquarium, and both Pacific Grove and Monterey are easily walkable. Kevin was very nice and responsive to all our communications once he received them. "
1909416,20226817,2014-09-26,7619814,Chad,"The place was as advertised, bed was a bit uncomfortable."
1909416,20898522,2014-10-07,18941743,Joan,"We appreciated the welcome ""notes"" and the notebook full of useful information.  The cottage was so well represented on Kevin's website -- it's as charming as it looks and very well equipped.  We ate breakfast and two dinners there and found everything we needed in the kitchen.  The mattress was very kind to our aging backs and we hung out a lot in the dining room with the cheery California sun streaming in the windows.  The Steinbeck Cottage was an important positive factor in our marvelous week-long stay in San Francisco.  Thanks Kevin! "
1909416,20988493,2014-10-09,7266991,Agnes,"Great place, great host! The Steinbeck cottage is wonderful! It's cozy, clean and comfortable and we loved our stay there. We didn't meet Kevin on-site, but he stayed in contact with us all the time and gave us a lot of recommandations to make our time in Pacific Grove as nice as possible. The two tickets for the Monterey Bay Aquarium are a great benefit. It is definatly a Must-See! We felt like home in the Steinbeck Cottage and are sure that everyone will too."
1909416,21207387,2014-10-13,1154924,Valerie,"Kevin is a great host. He ensured we had all needed instructions to make your stay very comfortable. The cottage is a nice layout, it is well kept, clean, with a fantastic location to everything you would like as a tourist. You can walk to the aquarium, Cannery Row, beach, and tons of great restaurants. He even provides two passes to the aquarium which was a nice touch. Thanks Kevin!"
1909416,21761442,2014-10-23,22333380,Lauren,"My husband and I decided to spend the first couple nights of our honeymoon at the Steinbeck cottage. Such a good decision! Kevin welcomed us with a nice card and a bottle of wine. The cottage was exactly as pictured, very clean and inviting. I absolutely loved the history of the home and had a great time cooking in the adorable kitchen! If we ever find ourselves in Pacific Grove we will most certainly stay here again. Thank you Kevin!!"
1909416,21962959,2014-10-27,20371852,Amanda,"An absolutely perfect trip.  Our pre-arrival communication was clear, the cottage was beautifully set and everything went flawlessly.  We spent two days in Steinbeck heaven.  The beds were comfortable and the bath adorable.  We cooked all our meals and the supplies in the kitchen met every need.  The grounds were well kept and quaint.  The location perfect for a nice long walk along the bay and back through the town.   All around lovely experience. "
1909416,22185817,2014-11-01,20863362,Robert,"Celebrated our 40th anniversary with a wonderful 4 nite stay at cottage. Raised our glasses sitting around the private fire pit.
Very efficient and accurate communication with Kevin. 
Great place. Quirky, campy, unapologetically dated (maybe vintage is a better word), and a bit stale, but feels very authentic.  Feels like the family cottage at the lake - which is a good thing. Well equipped, even with laundry.  Very central location only a 10 minute walk from  Cannery Row and aquarium - altho hill pretty steep. Street parking is a nonissue. 
Access to their sister cottage is by a path immediately in front of your windows re privacy.  If your habit is walking around in your skivvies then either draw drapes, or relax and get to know your neighbours. 
Excellent choice - so much more pleasurable than yet another generic hotel.  "
1909416,22507258,2014-11-08,2207142,Licinia,Kevin was a great host and checked in with us to be sure we arrived ok! We had a great stay at the Steinbeck Cottage.
1909416,22695527,2014-11-12,21154047,Norman,"I would definitely recommend this rental.  Good communication from Kevin.  Great decorative touches, beats a vanilla hotel room for sure.  The cottage has a kitchen along with a separate dedicated dining area.  When you combine with the bedroom and sizable living room, you almost get twice the space of a comparably priced hotel room.  Parking is easy to find on the street, and complimentary passes (for 2 adults) are provided to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Internet connection was reliable and fast.  Great experience overall."
1909416,22893936,2014-11-17,2439465,Tony,Kevin was great! I personally didn't stay in the house that I booked (I booked it for a group of friends to run in the Big Sur Half Marathon). But as far as I know the experience was stellar.
1909416,23159259,2014-11-24,4896901,Christina,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a fantastic one.  The cottage was superb.  It was easy to see a lot of thought and attention to detail went into this place to make it a very comfortable home away from home. The wonderful location makes it easy to walk to dining, aquarium, and beaches.  Communication with Kevin was great, he was quick to respond whenever I had any questions.  And the bed…very comfortable! I slept well here.  And what a terrific perk to have aquarium passes for guests.  Great restaurants in the area, a short drive to Carmel, amazing hiking in the area, and a nice lil spot to have a glass of wine at the end of the night by the (push of a button) fireplace:)"
1909416,23267180,2014-11-27,662359,Janis,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Steinbeck Cottage for 3 nights with our daughter and her two children, ages 7 and 3. The Cottage was perfect for us as our daughter had the bedroom which sleeps 3, and we stayed on the pull out couch in the living room. The whole cottage is appointed well and very cozy, especially the living room! Enhancing the coziness was a gas fireplace operated by a remote, and a reading nook. We had all our meals in except lunches, and we were able to walk to The Monterey Bay Aquarium saving us the trouble to find parking for the day. The two Aquarium tickets provided with the rental was an additional perk. 
Not very far from The Cottage is the cute town center of Pacific Grove as well as a fabulous coastal walk along Monterey Bay. And the immediate neighborhood provided fun explorations by foot too.
Our host, Kevin Delaney, went above and beyond to be helpful and make sure we had a wonderful stay in his cottage! He answered all emails promptly before we arrived, and was always available through texting or an email if we had questions during our stay. After we arrived home our daughter realized she had left their raincoats behind - Kevin went out of his way to get them back to her!!
We absolutely loved our time there and would go back in a heartbeat!!! Kevin, his cottage, the town and the area are highly recommended!!!"
1909416,23696436,2014-12-08,12733277,Lauren,"Kevin did a great job preparing us with all of the necessary information from parking, to where to find things in the house, to recommendation on where to eat. The place was better than described. Absolutely ADORABLE! We had a wonderful time! Will definitely be back!"
1909416,23788289,2014-12-10,19298248,Jasmin,"We had an amazing stay at the Steinbeck Cottage.  Kevin was great and made sure we had everything we needed.  The house is GORGEOUS.  Though the photos are wonderful, they do not do the property justice. The house was also immaculate and the beds incredibly comfortable. I can not wait to stay here again. "
1909416,24810294,2015-01-03,5602727,Christine,Staying in the Steinbeck Cottage was a surreal experience. Kevin was an amazing host. We appreciate how he contacted us prior to our trip and after we had arrived. He was very helpful. The cottage was cozy and perfectly appointed. The location was perfect for us. We brought our bikes and traveled around town. We had so much fun. I came to the cottage with my boyfriend and we left engaged. It was very romantic.This is a trip that we will never forget. Thank you Kevin!
1909416,25322341,2015-01-12,24915204,Beth,"Kevin was a great host, and he made sure we had everything we needed. We could not get over how beautiful the cottage was! It's a 15-min. walk to the Aquarium in a quiet residential neighborhood and so close to Cannery Row and Lighthouse Ave. We appreciated the two free Aquarium passes, enjoyed cooking and eating in the darling kitchen and dining area, as well as reading by the gas fireplace. First rate place with tons of charm and comfort!"
1909416,25566756,2015-01-19,9924385,Franziska,"What a great place to stay. We enjoyed the Streinbeck's cottage during our two day stay. Kevin made us feel very welcome, we communicated well and everything was described correctly.

I would recommend a stay in a heart beat!"
1909416,26192795,2015-02-06,26758696,James,"My family visited the Steinbeck Cottage to celebrate a special occasion and get away for a few days. It was our first Airbnb experience and couldn't have felt more welcome. The home was warm and very inviting and was a welcome change from the usual hotel. Kevin was a fantastic host and made sure all our needs were met, and then some. Yes, tall individuals should watch their heads, but that adds to rustic charm of the cottage. The attention to detail was impeccable. A car is needed if you need to make your way into Carmel, Pebble Beach, or Big Sur, however, a great deal of Monterey was within walking distance. We would gladly stay again."
1909416,26965210,2015-02-22,27978319,Chao,The Steinbeck Cottage is an amazing place. It is so close to the beach and lots of good restaurants nearby. I highly recommend anyone who are driving from SF to LA to stay here for a night. We have a great time there! 
1909416,27329312,2015-03-02,26265976,Jan,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was perfection. The cottage was lovely, well appointed, and ideally located: a short and beautiful walk to the aquarium and Cannery Row, with easy parking. Kevin made sure we were comfortable and happy--and to say we were happy would be an understatement. There were several friends visiting Monterey for a wedding, and those who stayed at the four-starred hotel were quite envious of my charming and cozy accommodations. (And how fun, while in Monterey, to say that you're staying in John Steinbeck's cottage!)
Thank you, Kevin! I can hardly wait to come back."
1909416,27553195,2015-03-07,21235484,Gina,The Steinbeck cottage was amazing! We had a wonderful time in Pacific Grove. The cottage was very clean and every detail was well thought out. The cottage was the perfect location. We were able to walk every where. We hope to come back soon! 
1909416,27664804,2015-03-09,14591765,Bernard,"First impression: the cottage is even nicer than in the pictures.  Very spacious, very comfortable, very nice attention to detail.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium passes were a nice touch. Kevin was very responsive and welcoming. We will be back!"
1909416,27804036,2015-03-12,5165592,Carrie,"Kevin was great and the Steinbeck cottage was a fun place to stay.  It was very adorable, had some interesting John Steinbeck history, and we had everything we needed."
1909416,28013868,2015-03-16,27275842,Andrew,"My wife and I stayed at the Steinbeck Cottage for our 3rd anniversary. This was the first AirBnb experience for both of us, and it exceeded all expectations. The house itself was beautiful, clean, and very comfortable, with all of the necessary amenities provided. The location was also perfect, just minutes away from Cannery Row, downtown Pacific Grove, and downtown Monterey. Kevin was a wonderful host and quick to respond to any questions we had. He also had a bottle of wine and note waiting for us on the dining room table when we arrived, which was a very nice gesture. Overall, this was a terrific experience and we would definitely stay at the Steinbeck Cottage again!"
1909416,28469805,2015-03-24,14513512,Todd,"Fun little cottage, true to description and photos.  Stayed three nights with 4 adults and a toddler.  Easy walk to the aquarium, quick car ride to good selection of restaurants and sites.  enjoyed the ""vibe"" of Pacific Grove.  Cottage is clean and well maintained.  Access and communication were very easy.  Unqualified recommendation."
1909416,28663207,2015-03-28,28663720,Crystal,"Kevin was very responsive and helpful both before and during the visit. The cottage was even cozier than expected, and the fireplace was lovely. Parking was easy and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The aquarium passes were a sweet deal. There was also a lot of helpful information there like maps and local guides (like a book of Big Sur hikes). Overall, it was totally worth it! Much better than a crammed hotel room!"
1909416,28783052,2015-03-30,6933773,Kevin,"The Steinbeck Cottage is a labor of love.  Kevin and Vicky bought this property in dilapidated condition and restored it to it's former glory.  Actually, it's probably much nicer today than it ever was.  Everywhere you look, there is evidence of their impeccable taste and attention to detail.  There are several cozy nooks to read.  There is classy writer's desk with an antique turn dial phone (doesn't work - I tried).  The kitchen and dining area look into a quaint little garden.  There is a neat rock path, which had been buried under several feet of dirt, which the owners painstakingly uncovered with their own hands.

The cottage is easily within walking distance to down town Pacific Grove and the Aquarium.  One awesome perk is that the Cottage comes with two adult guest passes.  That easily saves you over $80, when you factor in parking at Cannery Row.

We brought our two small children (3Y and 5 mo).  Kevin even had a pack n'play for us to use.  My 3 year old son slept on the pull out futon in the bedroom and loved it.  Note, though,that the bedroom, like the rest of the home, is poorly insulated, so you'll definitely want to leave the space heater on!

We had a wonderful time.  The Cottage exceeded our high expectations and deserve all the positive feedback they have received.

BTW, the restaurant at the Intercontinental has a great brunch, is surprisingly kid-friendly, and has a great view of the ocean."
1909416,29196662,2015-04-05,29056463,Noah,"We had a great time at the Steinbeck's Cottage.  We wanted a comfortable, safe, cute cottage/home walking distance to the aquarium and this property was a great fit for us."
1909416,29685702,2015-04-11,5696704,Brad,"The Steinbeck Cottage was perfect and all that it was billed. The space was lovely, cozy, and welcoming. Bed was comfortable. Our boys were fine on the pull out couches. The location was excellent. We had a lovely meal at Cafe Moulin. Day trip to Pinnacles National Park was well worth it to see condors and the amazing geological formations. We were also inspired to head to Salinas to the Steinbeck Center. Also worth the trip. Kevin was readily available and helpful but gave us our space. Thanks!"
1909416,29825323,2015-04-13,14423248,Kathy,Kevin was a pleasure to work with.  The cottage was just as beautiful and clean in person as in the pictures.  We enjoyed the location to the aquarium and downtown Pacific Grove.  Kevin left us some wonderful restaurant recommendations that we used.  Kevin was the perfect host and made everything from booking to checking in easy.  His response time was very quick.  We would recommend staying at the Steinbeck cottage to everyone we know traveling to Monterey.  Thanks Kevin and Vicki!
1909416,30202079,2015-04-19,28351820,Janice,"My family had a wonderful stay at the Steinbeck Cottage.  Kevin was easy to work with and always responded quickly to questions.  The cottage was very clean, comfortable and felt very homey.   Our boys enjoyed sleeping on the pull out couch in the living room.  We especially appreciated being able to walk to the aquarium.  "
1909416,30620248,2015-04-25,17227933,Ryan,"This was our first air bnb experience and it was an amazing success. The cottage was right out of a storybook. Beautifully decorated and very charming. It was big enough for 2 adults and 2 young children to live comfortably for a week while enjoy the surrounding area. The hosts we vey quick to respond to any questions and everything was very clear and easy. Great place, great hosts. Highly recommend!"
1909416,30751861,2015-04-27,10189461,Amanda,Kevin and Vicky have put together a perfect retreat for anyone looking for a home away from home in Pacific Grove. We stayed at the cottage for the Big Sur marathon and found it to be a peaceful haven for pre-race relaxing. We wish we could have stayed another day. The washer and dryer were a nice bonus! And the booklet guide about the cottage told us everything we needed to know. Bonus points for the aquarium passes!
1909416,31947543,2015-05-12,29391564,Erik,"Beautiful decorated cottage on a good location in Pacific Grove. Has everything you, from kitchen utensils to good beds and a really comfy couch. Also Kevin and Vicky are really pro active hosts!"

1909416,33117994,2015-05-25,7129350,Gabriel,"The John Steinbeck college is a really cute and cozy cottage right in the heart of Monterey. The decor is charming and everything was exactly as expected from the pictures. Kevin & Vicky left thorough instructions for how to get to the cottage and how to get in and even checked in to make sure everything was going okay! We never saw them but they did a great job from afar.

One note is that the cleaning fee is quite high and there is an additional $39 charge that is added as a ""city occupancy fee."" I can't find any reference to this anywhere else on the internet so I wish they could have been more specific as to where it came from."
1909416,34198630,2015-06-06,3432937,Stephanie,The hosts were very helpful in regards to everything!

Thank you Kevin and Vicky, your place is amazing and we had a great time!"
1909416,35567508,2015-06-20,27100106,Tammy,"A magical experience! Okay, I won't even talk about how it feels to read John Steinbeck in the living room of a house where he actually lived (amazingly surreal).  All that aside, the cottage is even more beautiful and cozy than I expected.  I loved it there and would (will) go back in a heartbeat.  There are soft, fluffy blankets in every corner which are just right for snuggling in on a chilly evening or morning.  The dining area is surrounded by windows and the morning sunlight streams right in -- breakfast there is a dream.  The bathroom is so cute -- ceiling is low but that just adds to the charm, and my son is 6' 3"" and managed just fine.  The kitchen is vintage awesome and has everything we needed.  The whole place is decorated beautifully, and the hosts thought of everything.  Basically, I felt immediately at home there and would not change a thing.  What I liked best about the cottage -- the remote controlled gas fireplace that was perfect for the chilly evenings and so beautiful in the space; the strand of mini lights wound around the decor on the shelf in the dining area that worked on a switch; and the blue tile on the bathroom floor.  What I liked best about this listing -- the hosts are totally responsive via text.  They even texted in the evening on our first day there to make sure everything was going well.  We had no problems whatsoever, but it was wonderful to know that if we needed anything, we could reach them and they would respond.  I can't wait to go back."
1909416,35729229,2015-06-21,5270447,Sean,The Cottage is amazing. Must. visit. again.
1909416,36416487,2015-06-28,7860091,Jessica,"What a great place to stay! We really enjoyed our time at the Steinbeck Cottage. The house has everything you could need and is such a beautiful environment, both inside and outside. The location is also very convenient. We really hope to stay here again. "
1909416,36756593,2015-07-01,11595709,Angeline,"Absolutely loved the house, even my kids! Kevin  and Vicky decorated the house in such a cozy way that each one of us was always looking forward to going home at the end our day after exploring the area. There were lots of spaces for the 5 of us (2 adults and 3 young kids). The house was clean and has everything you need to make your stay comfortable. Both Kevin and Vicky are always reachable. We definitely loved our experience. It was a very nice stay for us."
1909416,38117487,2015-07-13,32293162,Hannah,My friends and I stayed at the cottage for a wedding in Monterey. The cottage was beautiful and inviting and exactly as described! It worked very well for the five of us -- cozy but plenty of space. Kevin and Vicky were inviting and very responsive whenever we had an issue. I'd highly recommend staying in their wonderful cottage!
1909416,38476760,2015-07-16,753771,Peter,"It would have been good enough just to stay in a house once owned by John Steinbeck. But our stay was much more than that. The house is perfectly located in a quiet neighborhood that is close enough to walk down to Cannary Row, shops, and the beach... Yet somehow feels remote and even rural. I saw a deer in front of the house one morning, for example. The house fit our family of four quite comfortably, and was clean with plenty of amenities. We will certainly look to stay there again."
1909416,39368531,2015-07-23,62142,Eva,"Great place, super clean, tastefully decorated! Highly recommended!"
1909416,39605404,2015-07-25,29893989,Sharon,Kevin and Vicky checked on us as soon as we arrived to make sure everything was alright. They were quick to respond to questions and recommended great places to eat.  The house manual was very helpful.  We thought the neighbors and quiet/peaceful neighborhood added to our relaxing vacation in Pacific Grove.  We enjoyed staying at The John Steinbeck Cottage. We highly recommend staying here.  Hope to be back soon!
1909416,40303830,2015-07-30,26314200,Alistair,"This was our first ever Air BNB experience and it did not disappoint. A home from home, lovingly kept, brilliantly located, and full of little touches that delighted. Sitting in one night watching East of Eden, the aquarium, seeing whales from the shore, we have so many great memories. Thank to Kevin for being a great host and for the sushi recommendation. One of the best places we have stayed in our month long trip"
1909416,40893293,2015-08-03,28915340,Eva,Allting fungerade utmärkt. Bemötandet var fantastiskt och stugan helt underbart. 
1909416,41308260,2015-08-07,13784961,Richard,"We loved the John Steinbeck cottage. It is in a great location close to Cannery Row in Monterey and is very well furnished and equipped. It is a charming place to stay and we would thoroughly recommend it. We stayed as a family of five - adults in the spacious bedroom, two children on the comfortable sofa bed in the living room and the third choosing to sleep on a sofa which made a great nest. The Steinbeck history of the cottage only adds to the charm."
1909416,43482008,2015-08-20,27209179,Didier,"A true nest of beauty, a bit like a doll house, very nicely decorated, we could feel this place has a soul, every corner was sooo cosy, you just wanted to stay there for hours reading a book along with a good glass of wine.
The tv enabled us to plug-in a usb hard disk with some french movies for my daughter and that was certainly a plus.
The back garden is very peaceful and the house is almost walking distance from the heart of Pacific grove.
The perfect spot for a relaxing holiday, we will certainly come back !"
1909416,43768285,2015-08-22,14201147,Sandra,"Staying in the Steinbeck cottage was such a treat! It felt like a throwback to simpler times but with all the modern conveniences. We loved the decor, books and furniture. Kevin and Vicky were very responsive and pleasant in their communication. Would highly recommend this place to friends!"
1909416,44441999,2015-08-26,12749222,Agnieszka,"Beautiful, charming cottage. It has a very special feel and it's perfectly manicured. We had an amazing experience.
"
1909416,44916762,2015-08-30,16355072,Jonathan,"We enjoyed our stay at the cottage. Kevin and Vicky were thoughtful and considerate hosts. They did a great job sharing information about the cottage and the surrounding area before we arrived, and then the place was replete with guidebooks and other information for our travels around Carmel, Monterey, Big Sur, and so on. The neighborhood is odd but very convenient to the aquarium and the other places we visited. The cottage itself was quirky (especially in terms of ceiling height) but more than met our needs, and it was nice to see friendly faces at night as we crossed paths with people staying in the other cottages. It was definitely cool to read Steinbeck's letters from Eardley Street while on Eardley Street."
1909416,45414325,2015-09-02,41462626,Robert,We loved our stay at the John Steinbeck Cottage! It was just as advertised and the perfect spot to enjoy our stay/wedding in the Monterey area. Thank you Kevin and Vicky!
1909416,45792400,2015-09-06,270856,Jeffrey,"Kevin and Vicky's Steinbeck cottage offers one of the very best Airbnb experiences you can have. Compact but imaginatively constructed, its design evokes less the memory of its previous author owner than it does of another writer-- Lewis Carroll. Historical accuracy aside, that's all to the good because the world of Alice in Wonderland is much more fun that The Grapes of Wrath. 

Speaking of books, Kevin and Vicky could write their own about emphasizing period detail, for they've done a masterful job  with this cottage. If you appreciate unique architectural features (you should, you ingrate!) you'll be awed immediately by the curvature of the pitched ceiling in the living room and kitchen areas. Also of note are all the little storage cubbies, antique kitchen sink, and low (6') entryways. About the last point-- in a show of thoughtfulness for their taller guests, Kevin & Vicky have installed soft padding along the top edge. This means visitors above 6' avoid near decapitation and are instead gently reminded that a slight bend in posture is necessary. 

In addition to the inside of the cottage, what's outside is attractive as well. First, the seating area replete with fire cage (bring your own logs). Just beyond the property, the town of Monterrey invites exploration. Nearby neighborhoods are renowned for the eclectic architectural styles. Definitely worth a stroll. As other guests have noted, the world-class aquarium is a short walk away, as is the delicious chowder from Vivolo's. 

Lastly, but just as important, it's clear that Kevin & Vicky take a lot of pride in hosting. They are prompt and thorough in their communication, providing all the information one needs to have an enjoyable stay. Combine all of these things and you're assured a memorable experience.  My visiting family and I certainly did.

1909416,46114487,2015-09-08,17884421,Bernadette,"The Steinbeck Cottage was just like is depicted in the photos. The hosts, Kevin an Vicky, were perfect. They check-in with us after we arrived to be sure everything was ok and also gave us our privacy. The location was perfect for us. We were within walking distance to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which was a huge draw for us as we were vacationing with our young children. I highly recommend this place if you are staying in Monterey. Extra bonus - Author John Steinbeck actually owned the house in the early 40s. Very cool."
1909416,47615910,2015-09-21,30129761,Jenn,"This was the loveliest and most incredible little space. The three of us were quite happy living in the house for a week on a writing retreat. We read and were able to cook and chat and the house was so wonderful we never really left. 

The location, however, did cll to us and walking down to the coast every afternoon became our new normal. We already miss it and we're looking forward to returning. 

Everything about the house was lovely. Thank you. 
"
1909416,48691374,2015-09-28,37284648,Beau,"This is our first time using Airbnb. The Steinbeck Cottage exceeded our expectations by a mile. My wife lived in Pacific Grove for a few years. We are both very familiar with the area and love the historical homes. This place was like staying in a piece of history. I highly recommend this place if you like something different than an ordinary hotel. Also, Kevin and Vicky were always fast to answer questions. We'll definitely come back to this place!"
1909416,49097985,2015-10-01,2417023,Sylvia,"Loved every bit of our honeymoon stay at the Steinbeck Cottage. The space was  beautiful and welcoming. So much so that we decided to stay an extra night. The cottage is close walking distance to Cannery Row and the Monterey Aquarium, which is a must-see. We took day trips to Carmel and loved the romantic, dreamy energy of this part of California. One thing to note- my husband is pretty tall and the ceilings at the cottage are pretty low so he had to adjust to that a bit.. He still loved it though and didn't seem to mind too much since everything else was so perfect. Thank you Kevin and Vicky for sharing this beautiful place!"
1909416,49419866,2015-10-04,14675447,Kate,"We had a fabulous time staying at the John Steinbeck cottage. It was charming and had a peaceful ambience. We enjoyed being able to walk to the Aquarium, to some lovely restaurants and along the waterfront around to Lovers Point and to ""Crema"" cafe in Pacific Grove. Kevin and Vicky were lovely hosts and responded promptly to our requests for extra towels, and to using the TV. We really enjoyed our stay. "
1909416,49892381,2015-10-07,39944328,Katie,Amazing stay in the John Stienbeck cottage. Couldn't have asked for a better place. Perfect location and fit five of us comfortably. 
1909416,51267490,2015-10-19,33616878,Carroll,"A charming, comfortable home in a quiet neighborhood. The home itself was once owned briefly by John Steinbeck and there were a few period items that gave it authenticity. The home was cozy but not cramped and was well appointed, with a nice little sitting area in the patio. Lots of windows to give the place light. Location was blocks away from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row, but those blocks involve a steep hill, so if you're walking, save a little energy after the day's festivities. Plenty of street parking nearby. There are two other units on the same property. Owners were attentive and responsive, even dropping us a text to alert us about an area-wide power failure. All in all a very nice home base for a weekend in Monterey area."
1909416,52396152,2015-10-29,36216834,Valeri,My experience at the Steinbeck house exceeded all expectations. The look and feel of the house is so lovely and authentic. It really takes you back to another time. 
1909416,52817936,2015-11-02,21261748,Donald,Kevin and Vicky were very gracious and the cottage was amazing.  It had everything we needed including a really nice kitchen for the nights we wanted to stay in.  The location was great and an easy walk to the water and the cannery district.  I would highly recommend staying here.
1909416,53207992,2015-11-06,7807495,Patricia,This was our first Air BnB experience.  We really enjoyed staying here. The cottage is very comfortable and everything was easy to use. Listing was accurate and communication was prompt and responsive. We toured around each day of our 4 night visit and we were glad to come back each evening and relax. Quiet neighborhood but central to Highway 1 attractions. Enjoyed the local Farmer's Market. We would stay here again if we have the opportunity!
1909416,53873848,2015-11-14,547357,Megan,"Kevin and Vicky's place was fabulous. We really enjoyed curling up by the fireplace, walking to the beach, and soaking in the history. The Steinbeck Cottage is a perfect retreat and my husband and I enjoy the rest and relaxation the place provided. "
1909416,54847327,2015-11-25,12808978,Alice,"We had a wonderful stay at the Steinbeck cottage. It was a cozy few nights with the gas fireplace and lovely decor (with meticulous attention to the smallest details). It felt like home, and we would be honored to return for another stay!"
1909416,56256859,2015-12-11,15241761,Sita,"Staying in John Steinbeck's cottage was an absolutely lovely experience. It was close by everything we had hoped to see and a great location. Kevin and Vicky were easy to work with, accommodating, and gave us all of the information we needed to enjoy our time there. The cottage is expertly decorated and very comfortable. We enjoyed reading by the fire and cooking dinner in the cute kitchen.

Thanks again Kevin and Vicky -- Hope to come back soon!"
1909416,56733913,2015-12-17,15181172,Vanessa,"We loved staying at this beautiful cottage for our Anniversary! One of our favorite features was the cozy fireplace in the living room. It put off a lot of heat and was romantic to cuddle by the fire. The cottage is close lots of great dining and a very cute coffee shop which we enjoyed having delicious coffee in the morning. The only improvement  I would make was cottage did have a little bit of a musty smell when we arrived. I don't know if this is common with most older beach houses. We kept the  dehumidifier going during our stay and it seemed to help. Overall, it was a wonderful experience staying in the cabin! "
1909416,59245256,2016-01-08,5278634,Tina,It was one of the most beautiful and peaceful places we had visited! It was gorgeous beyond belief and hidden away like it was its on personal secret cottage. The fact that it was John Steinbeck's made it just that much more incredible! Would recommend this to anyone visiting Monterey!
1909416,59904868,2016-01-17,2673823,Marialice,"The little cottage is exactly like the photos.  
Charming, clean, comfortable and probably the best
airbnb we have stayed in and we have stayed in many.
We are already thinking about when we can return to 
this special place."
1909416,60704564,2016-01-26,43024725,Michael,"We absolutely loved this place. Everything was set up perfectly, the hosts didn't miss a thing. We felt at home and comfortable from the minute we walked in the door.  There is nothing quite like reading a John Steinbeck book (To a God Unknown) while sitting in a reading chair in a cottage he once owned. The connection to history and to the author was worth the price of admission on it's own. It's far more than that though, this place has a charm and a character all it's own. Classic American authors memories are just icing on the historical cake!

The location in Pacific Grove worked just fine for us. It's right up the big ol' hill from Cannery Row, the Aquarium, and Fisherman's Wharf. It is also close to the start of 17 Mile Drive, which winds you along the coastline up to Carmel. Just as easily, you can head up (down?) Highway 1 to Big Sur. Basically, this place is central to the regions best attractions. 

We'll be back! "
1909416,61059885,2016-01-31,6049648,Leslie,"We loved our stay at the Steinbeck Cottage!! We had a special time spending time in a place where one of our favorite American writer's lived for a short time. I stayed up late into the night to finish The Red Pony, which was one of the many Steinbeck books supplied on the shelves.  It was also cool to look through the book of letters and read what was going on in Steinbeck's life while he lived in this house. The house was cozy and welcoming. The lovely kitchen was both stylishly rustic and usable. Even though there were two other cottages on the grounds we felt we had privacy. We loved the tempurpedic bed! Our hosts were also very welcoming and easy to reach if we needed anything. Thanks for the experience. "
1909416,62186257,2016-02-12,9863155,铮,Nice stay and cozy place. Kids love the setup. Conveniently located to everywhere. Enjoyed the stay!
1909416,62685087,2016-02-16,8627446,Levi,"Kevin and Vicky were easy to get ahold of and gave good instructions, the cottage is really cute and walkable to everything in PG/Monterrey.  Had a great stay while we were there, would definitely come back in the future."
1909416,63154464,2016-02-21,41220116,Andrea,Perfect location. Clean and comfortable. Wonderful trip and would recommend this home to anyone.
1909416,64430173,2016-03-04,4758156,Emily,"This was exactly as described and exactly what we'd been looking for, a charming and historic base for a three day birthday celebration.  "
1909416,65796212,2016-03-17,23550677,Jess,"This place was magical! Cozy up by the fire to read a book, play a game at the lovely farm table, or gather around the fire pit for conversation. Our family loved this place more than we've ever loved anywhere we've stayed & plan to return! The cottage was IMMACULATE, there was not a thing out of place and we were so comfortable knowing how well kept everything was. Perfect location, can't wait to return! "
1909416,67850747,2016-03-31,22570650,Kristyn,Everything about staying at this property was a DREAM. The Literature lover in me was attracted to the history of the property but the traveler in me was impressed with our hosts' hospitality. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
1909416,69208817,2016-04-10,55695818,Deborah,Lovely cottage in a great location near the ocean and aquarium. The cottage was very well equipped with everything we needed and we loved the decor. Highly recommend!
1909416,71493652,2016-04-25,12424504,Kristi,"Vicky and Kevin were attentive and responsive - providing helpful information and responding immediately to questions. 

The Steinbeck cottage was the best AirBnB I have stayed in! Everything about it made it a dream. It was extremely clean, smartly decorated, and very comfortable. As soon as my friends and I walked in we were captivated about how adorable the house was and how comfortable it was for 3 adults. 

The neighborhood was adorable and walkable. We had a great meal at Hula's the first night (15 minute walk) and walked to the aquarium the next day. It was also accessible to the running and bike path. 

I would definitely stay here, again! Highly recommend Kevin and  Vicky as well as their properties. "
1909416,71689859,2016-04-27,37137906,Tamar,"We were very happy with this choice. The listing was accurate and we received prompt and eager welcome and additional information via text and email. It was a pleasure to walk in the neighborhood and parking was easy.  The cottage was clean and ready, and our questions were answered right away."
1909416,72884525,2016-05-05,33748701,Spencer,"Everything related to the cottage was excellent - location, hostesses and the amenities.  Would absolutely love to use again!"
1909416,74039575,2016-05-12,23539161,Brad,The Steinbeck cottage was a true delight! Perfectly appointed with charm and character. Great location within walking distance to all the Monterey sights. The outdoor space is  lovely too. Can't wait to stay again!
1909416,81676063,2016-06-24,6319285,Gary,"We were very please with our experience with Kevin & Vicky at the John Steinbeck's Cottage. Communication with Kevin and Vicky was excellent and all of our questions were answered, mostly before we asked. The cottage was exactly as described, it is a wonderful cottage with a lot of quirky spaces that we loved.

Pacific Grove and area are a great vacation location, especially as a 25th anniversary getaway. It was a little cooler than we anticipated but we did pack appropriately and the fireplaces are ready to add a little comfort.

We would like to visit the area again and will certainly consider the Cottage or one of the other spaces Kevin and Vicky have available."
1909416,82813097,2016-06-29,22694528,Laura,"Me and my two friends stayed in the Steinbeck Cottage for two nights, and it was not nearly long enough. Of the four places we stayed over a week's time, the Steinbeck Cottage was the one we all agreed we could come back to and stay for at least a week. The breakfast nook was gorgeous and airy, the living room fireplace was such a treat for us city-slickers, the kitchen was gorgeous with cute details, and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. The pull-out in the bedroom was also extremely comfortable. We had such a great experience talking around the fire pit, and we found Pacific Grove to me so charming, quiet and endearing. Everything was as Kevin and Vicky described, and the place was very clean. Parking was very easy, and they provided plenty of instructions for check in, fireplace, check out, etc. Kevin and Vicky provided us with an experience we won't likely forget anytime soon. "
1909416,83193088,2016-07-01,70318245,Shelley,"I loved our experience at this house. The house has great light and feels so warm and inviting with the fire on. It is also incredibly walk-able. We walked down to play miniature golf, eat dinner, grab coffee, etc. and it was delightful. Kevin & Vicky texted us to make sure we knew all the ins and outs. I felt well-prepared and well cared for during this process. "
1909416,85586664,2016-07-12,74533048,Kim,"Everything was perfect. Super easy to find and parking smack out front. Everything you could ever imagine needing is in the cabin and it's very cute and well-maintained. The cabin was in an even better location than we first thought! It's basically right in the middle between Monterey and Pacific Grove. Cannery Row, Fisherman's wharf, etc. are all easy walking distance to the right, but if you go to the left, there is the little gem of downtown Pacific Grove which is full of shops, excellent restaurants, and several really nice beach options. We had a fantastic stay and I highly recommend this place! Thank you!"
1909416,86039257,2016-07-14,8917506,Jannie,We stayed with our family ( 2 adults/ 3 children) in the lovely Steinbeck Cottage. Everything was set up very smooth and the information from our hosts was excellent. It was an excellent stay.
1909416,86382112,2016-07-16,36655914,Adam,"The Steinbeck Cottage was great! Really warm and inviting and perfect for our time in Monterey! 

Kevin and Vicky gave us good recommendations for food and were very helpful with our check in and check out. 

Would definitely stay again!"
1909416,87354144,2016-07-19,51835602,Connie,"There are lots of ""homey"" touches!! Loved all the little nooks,etc..  Enjoyed the gas fireplace in the front room. Very cozy..."
1909416,87948860,2016-07-22,53449084,Jennifer,"We were so excited to visit Monterey, and turned out the cottage itself was one of the best attractions!  I still can't believe how such an interesting and historic house can feel so clean and new.  The cottage is in impeccable shape, very clean, and has so many beautiful touches throughout - just loved the decor.  My husband and I stayed with our 2 tweenagers and had plenty of space.  Between the family room couches and the bedroom sofa sleeper we were extremely comfortable.  The neighborhood was quiet, and the the bed was really comfortable.  It is in the perfect location, you can walk to most places, or take a very short drive.  We did the aquarium, 17 mile drive, and loved walking around in Pacific Grove.  Our hosts were very helpful, and provided all of the info we needed to enjoy our stay.  We loved everything about it!  
"
1909416,89098095,2016-07-26,50055723,Lee,"Such a beautiful cottage, we loved this place!
Nothing else to add but to echo  the previous comments - fantastic hosts, great location, a wonderful place to stay. "
1909416,91267466,2016-08-04,5303534,Jenny,We enjoyed this special house and its great atmosphere. we appreciated the lovely things on the shelves and the history of the place.
1909416,93207875,2016-08-11,44368093,Sophie,"Great house, lovely atmosphere, amazing decoration. Unique  and fully equiped ! 
2 points to Know: 
- very very slow internet
- no aquarium pass as annonced in the rental agreement."
1909416,94120377,2016-08-14,45618195,Ailsa,"I took a lot of time researching the apartments/houses we rented on our recent trip..all our Airbnb bookings proved to be great, but Kevin and Vicky's cottage was special. It was a unique, perfectly styled and exactly as described. Our family of five didn't feel at all crowded with the bedroom and living space being a good size. The boys loved watching the Olympics snuggled in the lovely blankets provided on the big sofa. Location worked well for us also. We walked down to the Aquarium, which was an easy stroll for our four year old, and also appreciated having good restaurants and store being a walk away. I would love to come back as a couple...its the ideal romantic hide away. Only watch-out was the intermittent wifi which could prove frustrating if you need to stay connected. For us we took the opportunity to disconnect, so it was fine by us."
1909416,98039539,2016-08-29,17623573,Rachael,We had a great stay here! As a party of four we were worried about the sofa bed but it was comfortable. We cooked on the first night and had everything we needed and laundry was great! I called Vicky and she answered straight away. A great place! 
1909416,99712816,2016-09-05,2342880,Erik,Unbelievably cool spot. Just as pictured. Every little nook is so thoughtfully decorated. Kevin and Vicky left us a nice bottle of wine and a handwritten card to help us celebrate. Thanks again!
1909416,100166785,2016-09-07,18496111,Myra,"This is a very delightful cottage in beautiful Pacific Grove.  The home is exactly as described  - and more!  It was fun to stay where John Steinbeck actually lived and wrote albeit for a short time.  Kevin and Vicky are excellent hosts!  The home was immaculate and so charming.  The location is great!  It is just a short walk to the Aquarium and Cannery Row and a very short drive to Pacific Grove's beautiful downtown area and seaside.  Thanks, Kevin and Vicky for opening up this home to travelers."
1909416,100716871,2016-09-10,3720572,Ben & Emily,"We had a wonderful stay at the John Steinbeck cottage. The place is very spacious and well decorated, and has many nooks in which to relax. We used the gas fireplace several times which made the place so cozy. The bed was very comfortable too. Pacific Grove is a fun little town to explore and has some great dining options, and the cottage is conveniently located. Kevin and Vicky were great hosts and communication was top notch. All around one of our top Airbnb experiences yet!  "
1909416,101333502,2016-09-12,14587839,Simon & Patsy,"This charming house is cosy and comfortable. Although it has beds for 5 or 6, make sure at least 2 of you are children. The area is lovely, its conveniently sighted for numerous local attractions and is a nice walk to the Ocean front. The garden could be better presented and falls below the high standards set inside the property but is a nice enough space."
1909416,107528315,2016-10-10,48773340,Shayna,"Kevin and Vicki provided information about the cottage and the history behind it .. Information was provided on local things to do and see in the area.
They were quick to respond to any questions or needs we had.
We were there almost a month and it truly was the most restful and lovely vacation I have ever had ."
1909416,110496750,2016-10-26,79941593,Juli,The host had a binder including an overview of all of the amenities and also had a list of recommended services in the area.  It was very helpful.
1909416,115204413,2016-11-22,39649532,Dayna,Absolutely worth every penny. Hoping to make this a yearly trip. 
1909416,115811077,2016-11-26,53101837,Abigail,"Our stay at the former Steinbeck residence was perfect. We came for an extended Thanksgiving trip with 3 kids and a grandma, and it far exceeded our expectations. The cottage was even more charming than we had anticipated and the location was perfect. We were at once centrally located and secluded. Everything we needed was within walking distance - food, aquarium, groceries - and yet, from our perch atop the hill, we felt removed from the touristy Monterey below. We were even able to make a Thanksgiving dinner in the kitchen. Highly recommend this place. Can't say enough nice things. A couple of notes: 1) The doorways are super low (thoughtfully padded)- my husband has to crouch to get through a couple of them. 2) The house is adorably decorated with tchotchkes and nicknacks - but they are breakable. We had to keep a pretty vigilant watch to remove breakables from the path of destruction of our 19 month old.  "
1909416,120773482,2016-12-11,36428069,Paula,"Vicky and Kevin are very kind and attentive! The space was accurately described, and I feel like they strive to make sure you're as comfortable as possible without being intrusive. Very kind, reliable, honest people. I would confidently recommend this amazing cottage. "
1909416,121794636,2016-12-18,70045624,Kimberly,"Our family of 5 enjoyed our stay at The Steinbeck Cottage. It was charming, cozy, and the beds were comfortable. The fireplace in the living area and heater in the bedroom were plenty to keep us warm during our stay in December.  The fire pit outside was an added bonus. Parking was easy and the cottage was walking distance to Cannery Row, the Aquarium and the beach. We loved the charm of Pacific Grove  and its beautiful beach and found it to be a convenient place to stay while we also visited Big Sur, Point Lobos, Carmel and Monterey.  Kevin and Vicky were wonderful hosts and provided quick responses to our questions. We highly recommend The Steinbeck Cottage and it will be our choice again when we return. "
1909416,127033935,2017-01-15,62746569,Andy,"We had a great time staying in your cottage. There was more than enough room for the four of us. The location makes it extremely easy to walk around and explore the many restaurants and other tourist attractions on Cannery Row. We also enjoyed the outdoor fire pit and could even hear the nearby seals. Once again, thanks for sharing your home with us. "
1909416,129695027,2017-02-01,100926916,Denise,"Quaint and charming cottage located in the heart of Pacific Grove that is within walking distance to the ocean, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Cannery Row and restaurants. John Steinbeck fans will especially enjoy this place where he once lived."
1909416,131278769,2017-02-11,41806229,David,"A beautiful setting with quite a story behind it! We were reading Grapes of Wrath for our son's homeschooling, and the opportunity to stay in Steinbeck's writer studio was an opportunity we couldn't pass up. We enjoyed the aquarium, Pacific Grove, the monarch habitat, and drives up and down the coast. Lovely!"
1909416,131779983,2017-02-13,60842051,Wendy,We had an amazing stay at The Steinbeck Cottage.  Very comfortable with so much to do and explore in the area.  Loved the interesting architecture of the cottage!
1909416,132887948,2017-02-19,28896912,Spencer,"Couldn't have asked for a more perfect place or better hosts! Vicky and Kevin were incredibly responsive, always made sure our stay was great, and made the experience truly incredibly! Their cottage was perfect and I will most definitely be back when I visit again!"
1909416,134121415,2017-02-26,743700,Lee,We had such a nice stay here! The house was so cozy and sweet! So much to do around the area. I would definitely stay here again!
1909416,136970399,2017-03-12,6489700,Arden And Mike,"Kevin and Vicky are readily available and reachable, and their place is wonderful. What a special place. Thank you 💛"
1909416,137494091,2017-03-15,116313846,Stephen,"Great location, close to the Monterey bay aquarium, close to Alisomar beach, lots of dining options nearby.  Highly recommend!"
1909416,137889156,2017-03-18,83361816,Hiba,"The Steinbeck Cottage was fabulous! Cozy and cute and most of all- comfortable! The charming cottage was hard to leave! Kevin and Vicky were attentive and responsive if we needed anything, but everything was perfect! We  loved staying there and hope to do it again! "
1909416,139119657,2017-03-23,115435331,Heather,"Loved the historical charms.  What a comfortable cozy house!  The kitchen was bright and the dining room was our favorite place to be together.  The history of John Steinbeck's time in Monterey was a nice touch.  Reading Cannery row and then driving down to it was pretty neat.  During the day, open up all the curtains and let the bright light shine in.  At night, snuggle up next to one of the fireplace heaters and read a book.  Our favorite place was the leather chair in the corner.  Had few issues regarding cleanliness especially since the cleaning fee was so high.  Hopefully the owners can get a better cleaning crew. "
1909416,141579850,2017-04-03,52574284,Mark,"We loved our stay in this cottage. It is such a fabulous location in a quiet neighborhood, yet still so easy to walk or drive to nearby things to see/do. It's a bit quirky as other reviewers have said (very short shower!) but I'd rather have a few quirks and stay here than be in a standard hotel room - this is much more comfortable overall and such a neat place :)"
1909416,142325408,2017-04-07,69262323,Barbara,Excellent location - could not be better. Everything is exactly the way it is described. Very cozy but spacious enough for a family. For Steinbeck lovers this is the perfect spot. 
1909416,144382004,2017-04-15,6762092,Melanie,"We loved our time staying at the Steinbeck Cottage!  It was full of charm, lovely nooks to read and cozy up, and enough space for our family (2 parents plus 3yr old and 7yr old).  We were able to walk for most of our stay - to the aquarium, dinner, coffee and more.  The bed and pull out sofa we used were both very comfortable.  Though we saw the guests from the other cottage walking by, we had plenty of privacy. We would definitely recommend it to anyone, and hope to stay again ourselves.  "
1909416,149041059,2017-05-02,16664235,Hm,"Awesome location, just a few blocks from the beach. Smartly decorated, with an inviting patio. Communication with the host was easy and the unit was clean. We would stay here again. "
1909416,161045736,2017-06-16,50446684,Marleen,"We had a great time at the cottage - it is exactly as described, very quiet and exactly what we needed for our week in Monterey - would stay here again!"
1909416,161893193,2017-06-18,54732594,Samuel,This is a great place with such an amazing literary history ! You can't help but imagine Steinbeck wandering around the house or sharing a morning coffee with you. The neighborhood is close to the Cannery Row attractions while being a bit removed from the touristy bustle. A great find for you to base your Monterey explorations. 
1909416,162606984,2017-06-21,66252974,Blair,Love the cottage! So much character. 
1909416,164763065,2017-06-29,50387003,Katie,"This cozy, quaint,historic cottage was perfect for our party of 3. Walking distance to restaurants and grocery store and the coast bike/walking path.  "
1909416,167991354,2017-07-08,83885746,Sonia,"We had a wonderful stay here. The place is exactly as pictured, very charming and beautifully decorated. Very close to everything yet in a nice private neighborhood. Would definitely recommend"
1909416,168879808,2017-07-10,30109266,Laura,We had a wonderful stay at Steinbeck Cottage and wish we could have stayed longer. Kevin and Vicky were a great help and super easy to contact when we needed anything! Lovely area and plenty to explore.
1909416,172034087,2017-07-19,55812609,Steve & Sue,"Without doubt we will remember our stay at the cottage. Apart from being beautifully decorated, furnished perfectly and spotlessly clean it just has quality detail on every shelf. Kevin and Vicky have genuinely thought of everything for the guest. This little cottage has an innate calmness, a tranquillity that we loved. "
1909416,174623950,2017-07-26,57102881,Vicky,Quaint & thoughtfully furnished. A great location for exploring Monterey
1909416,175700389,2017-07-29,10145279,Nicholas,"Super charming cottage - very well kept and managed - check in and out easy - warm and cozy st night light and bright during day - felt very private , other cottages on the property were occupied . A very enjoyable stay ."
1909416,177060160,2017-08-01,4912979,Ben,"The Steinbeck Cottage is wonderful! Our family of four was super comfortable there. Communication from Keven and Vicky was outstanding. They told us exactly how to check in, and contacted us early during our stay to ensure that all was OK. We found the cottage to be a bit larger than expected! The master bedroom is quite big, and the bed is VERY comfy! Both of our teens slept on the pull out in the living room and were very happy. There is plenty of seating outside when it is sunny and warm, and cozy electric stoves inside for when it is chilly.  The location is great too. We parked right in front of the house throughout our stay. And, we were able to walk to the Aquarium, downtown PG, and Lover's Point. In the other direction, it is a short drive to Starbucks, and good bagel shop, a liquor store, and what we found to be an excellent pizza shop (Mountain Mike's...even the gluten free pizza was excellent). Comfy, cozy, clean, and convenient is how we would describe the Steinbeck Cottage. What more could you ask for?"
1909416,180235643,2017-08-09,17826405,Maria,"A beautiful cottage in a superb location---walking distance to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and downtown shops/restaurants, as well as a grocery store.  Kevin and Vicky checked in with us often and were available for any questions.   Wholeheartedly recommend this place and hope to stay here again one day!"
1909416,182424405,2017-08-14,43204248,Martin,We are a family of 5 and loved our stay at the Steinbeck Cottage.  A beautiful and cosy home with the only drawback being that it is so nice that it seems such a shame to leave it and see the the local tourist attractions. On our second night we decide to stay in with the fire on and get a take away rather than got out to one of the local restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend the Steinbeck Cottage to friends and family.
1909416,200498367,2017-10-05,43234943,Grace,"The cottage is really amazing! We spent 4 unforgettable nights here, including my kid and my husband. Such quiet, cozy and historic house can be a place where we can take the full rest during our holiday. It’s also quite convenient, within reach to Carmel,No.1 Highway and most of all, the rocky, peaceful coastline nearby!

We will come here again with our family soon!"
1909416,220303172,2017-12-21,132433684,Zoe,We had a very pleasant stay at this historic property which was conveniently located for access by foot to the aquarium and Cannery Row.
1909416,238439269,2018-02-25,1883780,Elizabeth,Fun to stay in John Steinbeck's cottage. Felt everything was well done to approximate the original cottage.
1909416,240440915,2018-03-04,28725,Lou,"So cozy. After several hours of lounging by the fire drinking wine, one of my friends observed, “we’ve become cats!”

Fantastic architecture, lots of homey touches, and a great location. Can’t be beat for a getaway in Monterey!"
1909416,245549149,2018-03-22,164030402,Edith,Tres bien. Un vrai havre de paix. On s'y  sent comme à la maison.
1909416,249201476,2018-04-01,53456922,Liz,"This cottage is a wonderful place to stay! It’s on a beautiful, quiet little street, which is a short walk from the sea and the seals! It’s really near the aquarium and all the other brilliant things to do in the area. The cottage itself is cosy and very comfortable and has all the facilities you might need. Me and my husband stayed with our 12 year old twin sons, and we all found it to be utterly charming. We’re all book lovers so the fact that John Steinbeck once lived here was an added bonus. Kevin and Vicky are fantastic hosts and very responsive and helpful. I highly recommend this fantastic cottage, and hope to stay again if we’re ever back in the area."
1909416,250627438,2018-04-05,40554641,Kc,It’s worth coming here! Very friendly space and lots of places to visit nearby.
1909416,251331887,2018-04-07,95567279,Melinda,The cottage was perfect. The communications were quick and easy. The information about John Steinbeck and surrounding areas were so helpful. Everything was well thought out and all we needed was right there. It was perfect. We can’t wait to come back!
1909416,252916574,2018-04-12,119941327,Joanna,"The Steinbeck cottage was amazing. If you have a chance to stay here, I would definitely do it. It is very quaint, cute, and private. Vicky was very responsive when we had questions, and she helped make our stay very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Steinbeck, history and a peaceful quiet place to stay in Pacific Grove."
1909416,253528403,2018-04-14,28228599,Meghan,"We absolutely loved this place! Every piece of it was beautiful, cozy, and charming. Kevin & Vicky made check-in and check-out super easy and the place was so clean and organized with everything we needed. It was a wonderful location within walking distance to the water and close enough to make it easy to drive and explore Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur etc. The cottage is a perfect romantic getaway that we would definitely seek out again. It was our favorite Airbnb we've had the pleasure of staying in!"
1909416,254464846,2018-04-16,11785708,Benjamin,Loved the cottage! Perfect location for a family of four (kids 6 and 4) to explore the area. And everything was smooth and as promised.
1918627,8809885,2013-11-18,9974972,Bjorn,"Wondrous hostess, warm cosy house, great location. High quality everything, immaculate condition, great amenities and efficient compact living. An awesome base for exploring the Monterey Peninsula, an overall awesome little Blue-house. "
1918627,8962036,2013-11-28,10082312,Gayatri,This charming home is conveniently located near the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the main street of Pacific Grove. Perfect for holiday with kids or an antiquing trip. 
1918627,9501295,2013-12-31,10414921,Joan,"We had a great 3-day stay at the Blue House in Pacific Grove. The house is very clean, charming, and had all the things that we needed from a home away from home.  The location is also very convenient, close to everything in the Monterey Peninsula. We easily traveled to Carmel by the Sea, Monterey Bay, and to Big Sur. Maria was also a pleasure to work with! She even made sure that we were able to visit the Monterey Aquarium by leaving our name at the member services desk (as a previous renter had accidentally taken the aquarium passes with them).  Overall, we had a wonderful stay at this home and would highly recommend it for anyone looking to stay in this beautiful area.  "
1918627,9562353,2014-01-02,4281843,Todd,This stay is a great experience. You can't miss.
1918627,9940162,2014-01-20,11164701,Kelli,My friend and I had a great weekend away from our husbands and kids. The house was immaculate and comfortable.

1918627,10073017,2014-01-28,2419047,Jennifer,"My husband, daughters and I had a wonderful time staying here. It is a tastefully and well appointed cottage conveniently located within walking distance to restaurants, a beach and the scenic walkway along the bay leading to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  "
1918627,10127410,2014-02-01,5510499,Erin,"Beautiful home tucked a few blocks away from shops, restaurants, bakeries, and more! The home was wonderful, very clean, and nice for a family!  
Maria was curious and prompt!  I will be looking forward to staying in her home again!
"
1918627,10185203,2014-02-04,11613152,Joel,"My mother has been battling illness and needed a change of scenery.  The Blue House provided us with a charming central location for the Monterey Peninsula's activities - the 17 mile drive, Point Lobos, the Butterfly Grove, live jazz and lovely dining. Complimentary aquarium passes were a terrific addition.  Maria is a charming and attentive hostess. Her home has terrific conveniences and has been nicely updated.  PG has a great feel; running on the Coastal Trail and the nearby Asilomar sunsets were special treats. The home and neighborhood felt safe and welcoming - I'm sure we'll be back!"
1918627,10314117,2014-02-12,7140738,Ben,"The house was immaculate and location perfect for us - walking distance to amenities in Pacific Grove, and the shoreline.  Great communication with Maria throughout.  Highly recommended."
1918627,10370063,2014-02-16,2657409,Juan,"The Little Blue House by-the-Sea was the perfect retreat for me and my family to spend a few days daytripping, taking in the California sun, and cooking for family in an exceptionally well-appointed kitchen. Maria -- You thought of everything to make this a pleasure -- Thanks!"
1918627,10425455,2014-02-18,520915,Michelle,We had a great stay! The place is nice and relaxing. I enjoyed the location being close to the beach and Lighthouse Ave. We'll be back!
1918627,10471367,2014-02-20,2915002,Nate And Andrea,We loved the Little Blue House!  It was a perfect retreat and a wonderful location for Big Sur and Monterey. I have already recommended the place to two different friends!  Thanks Maria!
1918627,10537222,2014-02-24,11473917,Alan,"Fantastic home in a great location! Easy access to shops, restaurants, and the beach but in a very quiet and friendly neighborhood. The house is very well appointed and comfortable and I'd highly recommend after our family's stay."
1918627,10620134,2014-02-28,11775723,Sarah,"This place is in the perfect location to walk right to Pacific Grove, the Monarch Sanctuary, the ocean, and the lighthouse. The kitchen is beautiful and well equipped, and the host Maria is very attentive and helpful. "
1918627,10723873,2014-03-04,12007822,Heather,"We had a wonderful time staying in the ""Blue House""! This home is beautiful, clean, well maintained, and the best location ever! The host, Maria, was very nice and had everything perfect for arrival. Since we arrived in the evening she had the lights on, perfect temperature, and even little fruit snacks for my 2 year old daughter! We enjoyed ourselves very much and hope to be back soon! Thank you Maria! :-)"
1918627,10788692,2014-03-07,10877652,Terry And Shaunessy,"We had a great time staying at Maria's place. The location was minutes away from the adorable downtown area of Pacific Grove, as well as the ocean. The house was spotless and super cozy!

One recommendation would be to buy firewood before you get there if you intend to use fireplace.  

"
1918627,10991703,2014-03-16,436272,Jessie,"This is a lovely home and conveniently located for exploring the Monterey area.  Just minutes from the Aquarium and the 17 mile drive.   The kitchen is fantastic.  We didn't do much cooking, but it has all the equipment you could need to cook a gourmet meal.  The space is as beautiful as it looks in the pictures and it is charming little place to stay.  The Aquarium guest passes are a  nice touch.  Maria was very easy to be in touch with and getting in to the place was a breeze.  Lots of good dining in the area... I highly recommend Il Vecchio  (menu in the helpful binder Maria provides).   "
1918627,11063232,2014-03-18,5704427,Hanan,"The Host: Maria was super easy to work with. She was very organized and easy to get a hold of. Communicates effectively. We ran into a few hiccups along the way but she was very quick to resolve.

The location: PERFECT location. Quick walk to the Beach and Lover's Point. It is also a quick walk to downtown Pacific Grove, which houses a lot of cute shops, cafes and restaurants. Pacific Grove is my favorite neighbourhood in the area. Not as Posh and pretentious as Carmel and a step up from Monterey. It is also very close to the aquarium and Cannery Row. 

The House: The house has a lot of charm. It is small but cute, clean and organized. The kitchen was beautiful. The house is old like most homes in the area - so it can be a  little ""creaky"" and you hear everything but that is to be expected in this area. 

Overall, I highly recommend the home and the host. You can't lose. "
1918627,11129192,2014-03-22,11687370,Alda,"The Blue House is a really comfortable and convenient place to live and explore Monterey. It's located in a quiet neighborhood where you can see A LOT OF stars at night (which is kinda hard to imagine in a city) and about 10-15 min walk toward the sea. Maria is a great host who keeps everything comfortable and clean. She's easy to reach and very responsive via email/text. She also offered 2 aquarium passes for us, which saved us a big money (it was $30+ for each ticket). My friend and I really enjoyed a great time here!"
1918627,11195314,2014-03-24,9506235,Tiffany,"We had a wonderful stay at this cute house! Everything was great, the artwork was awesome. Will definitely come back again
"
1918627,11305075,2014-03-29,5098965,Angelina,"My husband and I LOVED our visit here. Next time we come to Northern California, we are staying here again, for sure. The house was darling and had everything we needed. All of the rooms were perfect and the house in its entirety made us feel so comfortable. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this rental. The neighborhood was great- so quiet and peaceful.  I look forward to coming back very soon!"
1918627,11372027,2014-03-31,13203392,Teresa,"Maria was wonderful.  Although I never met her, she made the home so cozy, opening windows so that fresh air was in the home and placing a fresh bouquet of flowers on the table.  Everything was immaculate.  Loved our stay there.  Nice area to walk and enjoyed the aquarium.  "
1918627,11474990,2014-04-04,10889907,Steven,"What do you look forward to after a long day of driving along the PCH through storms and with two young kids in tow? A great place to shower, relax and rest.

That's where we ended up - the ""Blue House"". It's tastefully decorated and has pretty much everything you need to settle in. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood which is great after a long day.

We had a great time at the ""Blue House"" and would book a stay if we go to Monterey Bay in the future."
1918627,11516826,2014-04-06,118583,Ruth,"The Blue House was great! Big, modern kitchen. Clean and well maintained. Walking distance to town and to the beach. We even walked along the coast to the aquarium. It took us about 25-30 min and was beautiful. We would definitely stay here again."
1918627,11585967,2014-04-08,6050641,Brianna,"Great place to stay in Monterey. House was super clean and had everything we needed. Location was perfect for getting around easily. And the aquarium passes were a real perk, saved us a good chunk of change to only have to pay admission for half our group. "
1918627,11794677,2014-04-15,11756152,Nicole,"We loved our stay at Marias Blue House. The House was so clean and beautifully decorated. The location was perfect so close to the ocean and the historic Part of Pacific Grove. Maria is a wonderful host.

We will definitely be looking to stay here for our next trip! Thanks for the wonderful time."
1918627,11885707,2014-04-18,8695517,Marc,"My family loved this house, and I found Maria extremely easy and pleasant to deal with.  Regarding the house:  the location is incredible and the space is comfortable and in very good shape.  As for Maria, she was helpful with food recommendations, communicated clearly throughout the process, and delivered on everything promised in the ad and in our communications.  We would definitely stay here again."
1918627,12006399,2014-04-21,2327045,Josh,"Maria is a consummate expert when it comes to the care and hospitality that she shows as a host.  The attention to detail was impressive, and really made you feel welcome in her home as though you were staying at the home of a good friend who were out of town.  From the bottle of wine and the nice note that were waiting for us, to the attention to detail with the fine bathroom amenities, coffee and numerous other items supplied for her renters, the level of care Maria takes to ensure a wonderful stay exceed those of even the nicest hotels I've stayed in.  I would rent from her any time, and plan to do so at every opportunity in the future!  

Thanks again Maria!

Josh "
1918627,12210186,2014-04-26,13077597,Aj,"We LOVED our stay at the blue house. Maria was an excellent host, and was super flexible in managing around us to check in / out. The house itself is in an excellent location that is quiet but a short walk to the beach and shops, etc. The house has everything you need for a short stay and the Safeway is a 2 min. drive away if you'd like to take advantage of the beautiful kitchen. A small, but fine, example of quality at the house are the Mrs. Meyers (organic, cruelty-free) soap products available throughout the house- they're expensive but excellent products. We've since made the switch at our house!"
1918627,12415089,2014-05-01,14105995,Wenfei,"We stayed in Blue House for three days, and would love to stay more days if we may spare more days in Monterey Bay. The Blue House is really amazing and we enjoyed all the time so much in it. It just takes us a few minutes to drive to the town, the fisherman's wharf, 17 miles or carmel-by-the-sea. We often drove to the town or carmel valley in the day, and got back to beach for the beautiful sunset then back to quiet Blue House. Everything was perfect for our staying over there. Maria introduced us wonderful restaurant nearby, and responded our question pretty timely. We appreciate her hospitality so much, and hope we may stay in Blue House again in the future. Best wishes to Maria and her Blue House! "
1918627,12548762,2014-05-05,8702170,Derek,The house and Maria were great! Place was perfect for me and my family. 
1918627,12832255,2014-05-12,1496770,Jacki,I stayed in the blue cottage for a perfect girls get away weekend. Maria did a great job setting up the house with really all the comforts you could need. I felt so welcome and lucky to stay in such a quality place. I would definitely recommend this house and Maria. Hope to come back next year 
1918627,13409693,2014-05-27,4524420,Benjamin,"We had a wonderful stay here for a week. The house is really great- the kitchen is really high quality, and the the furnishings were great too. It was super easy to get around from here to visit Monterey, the aquarium and Cannery Row. There's also lots of nice places within a short walk in Pacific Grove. Would love to stay here again."
1918627,13845527,2014-06-06,13784549,Adrian,"From the initial, pre-booking enquiries to the final thank you messages, Maria has demonstrated exemplary communication skills. Every question or request was dealt with quickly and efficiently. We needed a pack and play for our 2yo - Maria went above and beyond to secure us one. She kept in touch with us throughout our stay via the airbnb website.

She also provided a high chair and a much needed bottle of red wine for our arrival. She also offered to get us cereal and milk for our daughter's breakfast. The aquarium guest passes were extremely useful as we could see it over 3 mornings rather than one long day.

The house is exactly as described and the pictures are representative of the property. The bedrooms are a good size with plenty of room for suitcases. The living/dining area was a good size for our toddler to play - never did we feel cramped. The bay window provides a wonderful viewpoint to watch the world go by whilst eating dinner.

The kitchen is large and fabulously equipped with every saucepan, utensil, crockery and cutlery you could ever need. The range is fantastic! There is a toaster and microwave as well as a coffee machine and an old school kettle to use on the range. The BBQ in the back yard is a very good gas powered one. There was a good range of tea and coffee as well.

Check the pantry and fridge before you go to the supermarket - other than meat and veg there's every condiment and oil needed to whip up some good cooked food like spag bol. Ketchup, mayo, mustard, olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs, it's all there.

The beds were very comfortable. The house is in a very quiet area - best sleep We've had in a long time. The neighbours are quiet. The ones we met were very polite. The house has a full HVAC system so when it got chilly at night, we were nice and warm inside.

The shower is nice and powerful. Hot water was always available. Multiple cleaning instruments (vacuum, mop, broom) are available (if you have a toddler, you know what I mean). The washer and dryer work well with detergent, softener and Bounce provided.

There is ample street parking in front of the house. It's a 5-10 minute walk down the hill to the local supermarket (good butcher section for the barbie) and a 10-15 minute walk down the hill to the beach. The lovely village centre of Pacific Grove in about 10mins away where you will find some lovely cafes and eateries.

Maria also has good knowledge of good places to go to eat or visit, including good attractions/parks for kids.

In summary, this was the perfect holiday getaway for my wife and I plus a toddler. I would change nothing. I can't think of any other accommodation that would beat this! We'll be back!"
1918627,14017696,2014-06-10,13382914,Christopher,"My parents, my five year old son and I absolutely loved the Blue House. It exactly fit all of our needs - an exceptionally quiet and family friendly neighborhood that was located right near everything. The house is gorgeous and perfect for a small group who would like to explore the Monterey area. Maria is an exceptional host, which made the experience all the more enjoyable. I highly recommend the Blue House and would stay there again without a second thought."

por nuestra llegada y por nuestra estadía. Hasta nos recibió con una 
botella de vino de bienvenida. La casa es excelente, muy cómoda y super 
familiar. Es muy recomendable para personas que viajen con chicos pequeños.

1918627,14608706,2014-06-23,14384968,Shannon,Blue House is a really sweet and quiet home. It was impeccably clean and nicely appointed with nice furnishings and all of the amenities we might need. Wish we had more time to spend there. Maria followed-up with us throughout the process to ensure we were set for our arrival. Her responses were immediate and very helpful. We highly recommend staying at Blue House!
1918627,15088769,2014-07-02,12969350,Kelly,"We really enjoyed our six-day stay at the Blue House. The house was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. It was lovely, just as shown in the photos.  The neighborhood was quiet and there was a nice fenced-in backyard/patio where we could store our bikes.  We could easily walk or bike to restaurants and shops in Pacific Grove. We really appreciated the complimentary Aquarium passes, especially since that enabled our 8-year-old to go several times during our visit. We also enjoyed bike rides along the coastal trail with stunning views of the Bay, the tide pools at Asilomar, and a visit to Carmel. Maria thought of everything to make the house comfortable, with all the necessary utensils, bowls, etc. needed for cooking meals. We didn’t meet Maria but we communicated several times by text/email, which worked well. I would definitely recommend the Blue House for anyone visiting the Monterey Bay area."
1918627,15525831,2014-07-11,13166105,John,"We enjoyed our stay at the Blue House very much. The house more than lived up to its pictures, and was very clean upon our arrival and well stocked with everything we needed in the kitchen. There were even a few staples like spices, coffee and tea. The neighborhood is quiet, but only a short walk from restaurants and Lovers Point, and the neighbors were very welcoming and friendly. We really liked having such a comfortable place to come home to after our adventures, and found the home to be just about perfect. Maria was responsive and helpful both before and during our stay, and quick to respond to any of our questions. It was also thoughtful of her to call us on the day of our check-in to let us know that our house was ready a bit earlier than expected. The location was ideal for exploring the peninsula, as well as Point Lobos and Big Sur to the south (the Ewoldsen trail was spectacular), and the Carmel Valley to the southeast - if it's a cool day in Pacific Grove, head there to warm up! We took our daughter swimming in Carmel one day to give her a respite from hiking! Lastly, the aquarium passes were an added benefit. Truly, one of the nicest places we've stayed. "
1918627,15773499,2014-07-15,9145589,Kelly,"We had a lovely stay at the Blue House! Maria greeted us upon arrival and gave a tour of the house.

1918627,15860239,2014-07-17,6038416,Caroline,Lovely house in good location-easy to walk to Lovers point to watch the harbour seals. Really well equipped kitchen. We had a great stay. Thanks. 
1918627,16074596,2014-07-22,13054224,Eric,"Maria was a very welcoming and accommodating host. The aquarium passes were great. The house was clean, comfortable, and well appointed, a true home away from home. The neighborhood was quite and really close to everything. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and we look forward to staying there again. "
1918627,16247459,2014-07-24,15029357,Sheri,"From start to finish our experience with Maria and our stay at her Blue House was ""first class"". Initially I experienced some technical difficulty on the website, but Maria stuck by me until the booking was confirmed. My questions to Maria prior to our arrival and during our stay were promptly answered. She was more than accommodating. Upon our arrival we were delighted with the neighbourhood as well as the house itself. The location afforded us easy access to restaurants and shops as well as the ocean view and walking paths along the water. The Blue House is well maintained, very clean and comfortable.  Maria has thoughtfully stocked her house with everything a guest would need during their stay. It seems that she has considered even the smallest details in order to make her guests feel comfortable. We appreciated the info at the house on local restaurants and their menus and enjoyed a lovely meal at ""Il Vecchio"" thanks to the recommendation. We also used the aquarium passes that were made available to us. Everything was just as advertised! It was the perfect venue for our stay with friends in Pacific Grove. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. "
1918627,16368195,2014-07-26,7787041,Rick,"The little blue house was perfect. Everything was as it was presented on the site and Maria was excellent in her communication and detail-orientedness. 

It's a great location. We were able to ride our bikes to plenty of food options, shopping, the beach, and the aquarium. The neighborhood was very quiet and not 'sketchy'. 

The house was clean and the little blue house is a well-run operation. We would definitely go back. 
Thanks Maria!"
1918627,16541624,2014-07-29,368626,Melissa,"We enjoyed our stay at The Blue House. The house was very comfortable, well-equipped, and just like the pictures on-line.  It was easy to communicate with Maria. On the day of our arrival, she let us know when the house was ready (before the listed check-in time).

Pacific Grove is peaceful, pretty and near many beautiful places.  It is possible to do many things without a car such as dine, visit the aquarium, and go on a whale watching tour. We wish we could live there!"
1918627,16662370,2014-07-31,13329827,Jane,"Booking and communicating with Maria was very efficient and she dealt with every query helpfully. We did not actually meet Maria as we arrived late but she gave clear instructions on where to find the key.
I was travelling with a grandson from England, visiting my son and his wife who live in California. After booking, my son and his wife became able to join us in Monterey. We took an inflatable bed for the grandson but Maria had thoughtfully provided one for us, without me asking.
The house is in a very quiet neighbourhood. It was exactly as described and shown in the photos. It is extremely well equipped with appliances.
We were able to walk to local restaurants and navigate easily to the great attractions of nearby Monterey and Carmel.
We had a good time."
1918627,16820113,2014-08-03,6442418,Serge,The house owner was extremely welcoming; warm reception in a great and clean house! Owner was available for questions throughout the stay and pro-actively offered help and support. The house was clean and well equipped - everything was as per the description and honestly slightly better....
1918627,17091243,2014-08-07,6701334,John,"Maria was an excellent host. She was very responsive to questions before our trip and provided some great suggestions for restaurants. She met us when we arrived, walked us through the house, and provided helpful information about the area and suggested a few activities to do and places to go. And the Blue House was exactly as described in a quiet neighborhood just a short walk from restaurants and the beach. It was close to everything we wanted to do but away from the crowds in Monterey, exactly what we wanted. We'd definitely recommend the Blue House to family and friends."
1918627,17202930,2014-08-09,15062881,Jason,"The blue house was the perfect house to stay at for our trip to explore California's gorgeous central coast! The home was very clean, spacious and just perfect for 2 couples and a baby.
Maria, even supplied lovely toiletries for our stay. The home was a 5 min drive to Cannery Row, the Monterey Aquarium and to the entrance of the 17 mile scenic drive. The home is on a quiet and lovely street near many stores and shops, including downtown Pacific Grove.

We had a wonderful stay. The bedrooms were spacious and the bed  comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped with a built in wine cooler and there is a lovely outdoor space with a fire pit!

I highly recommend the blue house! We had a perfect stay!"
1918627,17331161,2014-08-11,12005605,Haydn,"The Blue House is as great as it looks. A lovely family property with great space in every room. The kitchen is very well stocked and the outdoor fire pit is a particularly good feature. It's a stone's throw from the sea front and even closer to the shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove. The host Maria was there to meet us and gave us a great reception. She even supplied some speciality teas! Our 9 year old boy and 7 year old girl loved it. Highly recommended.

1918627,18298591,2014-08-25,13708039,Kim,"The Blue House was a wonderful place to stay, and we really enjoyed spending time there.  Maria was incredibly helpful in her communications with us, including recommending restaurants and places to visit.  The facilities available to us were excellent, and the outdoor space - with the fire pit - was great.  Parking was easy, and there were many nice coffee shops and places to eat within walking distance.  Fantastic visit, and we'll be back."
1918627,18559615,2014-08-28,6864497,Melody,"I booked this lovely Blue House for my parents, who were visiting the area from Asia. Maria was very understanding and accommodating with some date changes my parents had to make due to unforeseen circumstances. She was also incredibly communicative and helpful prior to the trip - giving clear directions and offering advice and suggestions for places to eat and visit in the area. The house itself is gorgeous, beautifully furnished, clean, and lots of natural lighting. My parents were fortunate to have a late check-out and truly enjoy the house the next day. We'd definitely book again!

1918627,18877335,2014-09-02,1227642,Jill,"My family and I were going to a wedding in Monterey and found the Blue House on Airbnb. The house is lovely with great kitchen and living space, bath, 2 bedrooms, and private back yard with firepit. Everything in the home was updated and top notch: windows, bathroom, kitchen. We so enjoyed the home and location. We could walk to many restaurants and the pacific grove downtown. Maria and  Mikko were great hosts and very attentive to taking good care. The bottle of wine and Perrier were a nice welcome. Also the home had lots of things in the pantry that we were able to use. My husband loved the large television as he was watching the US Open and Pacific Grove Golf Course 5 minutes away."
1918627,19201076,2014-09-08,12231213,Annette,"We really enjoyed our relaxing long (6 nights) stay in Maria's Blue House. The house is well equipped, so it was easy to feel like at home. Everything was like it is described at the website. Although we couldn't meet Maria the day of our (late) arrival she provided every information we needed via email as well as in the information folder we found in the house. We appreciated the interesting books concerning nature of California (plants, birds, mammals, a.s.o) and hiking routes (surrounding Monterey and Big Sur) we found in the house! It was great to have two member cards we could use to visit the marvelous aquarium in Monterey for free. Maria was a perfect host and we highly recommend the nice and cosy Blue House."
1918627,19310886,2014-09-10,11458474,Rebecca,"Maria was a great communicator since our first inquiry.  My beau and I planned a Northern Cali elopement and wanted to stay in Pacific Grove/Monterey area before our wedding ceremony in Big Sur.  Maria's home is the perfect coastal retreat.  It's very bright, airy and clean.  We thoroughly enjoyed the little touches of 'kind and gracious hostess' that she left for us.  We loved the outdoor fire pit and big spacious kitchen.  Her home is centrally located in a quaint and peaceful neighborhood.  'Blue House' felt like our home away from home and made for a very memorable and enjoyable celebratory week.  We will be back and will recommend this home to our network.  Much obliged."
1918627,19508500,2014-09-14,10503893,Steve,"Lovely cottage feel to the house, clean throughout and Maria was always in communication.

"
1918627,19997827,2014-09-22,11388991,Glenda,"We had a wonderful stay at the Blue House. Unfortunately we did not meet Maria  (we just missed her when she popped over to say hi) but we did communicate via txt. The house was absolutely immaculate on arrival and Maria had left a bottle of wine & flowers to welcome us - a lovely touch. The Blue House has everything you need to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The instructions left by Maria were clear & concise, the beds comfortable with clean linen, nice powerful shower (I have a thing about showers), the kitchen a joy and the outside pit a delight to sit around. The location was perfect for us - we went for a run each morning along the coast to either Cannery Row or the opposite direction towards 17mile Drive.  Pacific Grove is charming with lovely places to eat or just chill at the beach. There is a lovely sheltered beach for swimming as well as a pool - all in easy walking distance from the house.
We were all 'blown away' by the charming Blue House and will certainly book it again on a return visit.  Thank you Maria it was a joy."
1918627,20187038,2014-09-25,19140078,Kristen,"Maria provided us with a very warm welcome and a bottle of wine to enjoy.  The house is beautiful, exactly as listed, and the neighborhood is quiet and very pretty.  Maria ensured all of the creature comforts - clean, fresh beds, abundant fresh towels, a full-size fridge, a washer/dryer, and a great wine fridge - were all in perfect order and convenient.  Maria is an absolute delight and cared very much for our comfort. We would certainly stay here again.

I thought the house was walking distance like a couple of blocks from the aquarium, but it turned out to be a 20 minute walk. It is a nice quite neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay."

We would definitely love to come back again! :)"
1918627,21086685,2014-10-11,2059234,Alex,What a beautiful and peaceful house and amazing little town Pacific Grove is. Had a perfectly relaxing weekend at the blue house. Grill was great. We went to the local grocery and used the kitchen for all of our meals. Everything you need is right there in the kitchen. The stove and oven are amazing! 
1918627,21575662,2014-10-20,10372611,David,"Beautiful little home in Pacific Grove. Maria  had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival which was the perfect beginning to out stay. The house is within walking distance of downtown and also the beach and walking trail at Lover's Point. Did I mention that the house also came with two free passes to the aquarium?! I'd highly recommend the blue house in Forest Grove.
"
1918627,21790665,2014-10-24,8798335,James,My wife and I visited the Blue House for 4 nights and it was extremely relaxing. We loved having a great kitchen so that we could just stay in for dinner and relax. The living room area can comfortably seat 4-6 people so you can enjoy a bottle of wine together. The street was very quiet and we would love to come back.

The fenced patio area was a great spot for the kids to play, and we all loved walking to the farmers' market and having a picnic dinner on the beach. Thanks to Maria for being communicative and accommodating! "
1918627,22298424,2014-11-03,19713427,Ryan,"Maria's house is cozy and welcoming. It has a rustic feel even though all the appliances are updated. The big bay windows let in a lot of light, and the house is only about a mile walk from downtown Monterey (and closer to Pacific Grove's main street)."
1918627,22580623,2014-11-10,3125119,Eileen,"Wonderful stay at Maria's blue house in Pacific Grove.  Charming, well-appointed house with lots of space to store clothes, settle in and feel comfortable.  The open layout in living dining kitchen areas is great and we could enjoy the fabulous wood burning fireplace from almost any vantage point.  Maria was very accessible and went out of her way to provide aquarium passes that were mistakenly taken by previous guest.  Highly recommend.  Would absolutely stay again."
1918627,22799451,2014-11-15,7492458,Ivan,"This place is charming, clean and ideally located to enjoy all that Monterey has to offer.

Thanks very much for having us, we hope to stay again in the future."
1918627,22945016,2014-11-18,20661282,Amy,"This was our first time using airbnb, and I must admit, I was sceptical. Boy was I proven wrong! The house was EXACTLY as described and maybe even better. The neighborhood was quiet and welcoming. I made the comment to my husband that I never sleep well on vacation because hotel rooms give me the creeps. Not the little blue house. I instantly felt at home and slept like a baby. It was warm, cozy, comfortable and one of the cutest house in the neighborhood. We WILL be back!!!"
1918627,23201984,2014-11-25,16000814,Ian,"We didn't just like The Blue House we LOVED it!!
The neighbourhood is very quiet yet a 5 minute walk to the centre of quaint Pacific Grove. Great parking too , right outside the door. The property is charming. Spacious comfortable living room with fabulous large screen HD TV and open fire if required.
Modern fitted kitchen with separate utility area for washing and drying. Both bedrooms are spacious and comfortable with separate clothes closets and chests of drawers, stylishly decorated in keeping with the rest of the house.
Maria very thoughtfully provided all sorts of house gifts on our arrival like wine cheese chocolates cake etc. Happy Days!! ( all sorts of other goodies left by previous occupants too)
There are also two unrestricted passes to Monterey Aquarium supplied at no extra cost which was an unexpected bonus.
There is also a very friendly welcoming neighbour 'Steve' close at hand should there be any problems or questions...
Maria has obviously given a great deal of thought and careful attention to providing such lovely comfortable stylish yet homely accommodation for her guests. 
We unreservedly recommend The Blue House and hope to return at our earliest possible convenience."
1918627,23264836,2014-11-27,2606212,Rebecca,What a lovely little house in a wonderful and charming neighborhood!  Walking distance to so much!!  Maria welcomed us into her home (blueberries and cumquats on the table!!)  and we couldn't have been more comfortable.  It was also great to feel so welcomed with our almost 2 year old daughter!  
1918627,23424971,2014-12-01,20220874,Cassandra,"Maria was easily the most perfect hostess. From her pre arrival communication and tips to her attentiveness while we were there, every exchange was so enjoyable. The neighborhood was more than we had expected. To be able to walk to the aquarium was such a treat. This has been a Thanksgiving we won't soon forget! "
1918627,23573886,2014-12-05,21760626,Trace,"We stayed at the Blue house for 4 nights. The directions were very easy follow and we had no problem finding the house. The Blue House was just as described, very beautiful ans quaint. We would highly recommend to anyone wanting a quiet, romantic getaway using this property.  It is very close to everything. 

Thank you Maria for opening your home to us.
Trace ans Claudia"
1918627,23839052,2014-12-12,15231736,Joan,"Very friendly and welcoming host, the bottle of wine, tea, coffee, spices, paper towels, other basic supplies made it easy to use the kitchen."
1918627,24219271,2014-12-23,4824728,Kelly,"Maria made our stay an absolute pleasure. We had a very friendly warm welcome from her neighbour as Maria couldn't greet us herself. 

The house was beautiful and cosy and we felt right at home immediately. My husband and I are travelling with our 3 year old and she absolutely adored the Christmas decorations set up in the house. It made it very special for her and we appreciated the effort.

The kitchen pantry had a good supply of basics and plenty of different utensils, pots and pans for use.

Unfortunately it was rainy or drizzled throughout our stay so it was a bit too soggy to go outside but it's a lovely area and the fire pit looks like a great place to spend a relaxing afternoon.

The neighbourhood is in a great location where you can walk to restaurants, shops and a grocery store. The Ocean View Boulevard is easily accessed and is a beautiful walk. 

We would definitely recommend the Blue House to other travellers."
1918627,24299117,2014-12-25,23274651,Ian,"A delightful, comfortable and  very well equipped Home. We stayed at the Blue house for Two nights in December 14 and it was very pleasant experience. Cozy and warm its like a home from home. 

It just has everything and more... I was really pleasantly surprised.  

Easy location to all the major attractions and easy walking distance to the shops.  

Maria's communications was just excellent and while I didn't get to meet her personally, we were introduced to Steve who was a very nice host and provided the key and got us sorted out the first day !

Parking is out on the street and there is plenty of room right outside the Blue House. 

I really recommend the Blue House if your planning on staying in the area its the perfect getaway."
1918627,24520606,2014-12-30,20698860,Rachel,"We really enjoyed staying at the Blue House - it is very clean in a great location (quiet & safe neighborhood, very short & easy drive to Monterey)!  The house has modern appliances and finishes, along with some special touches that made it very comfortable (nice smelling soaps, lots of laundry detergent & dryer sheets, books to read, spices & oils for cooking, etc).  It becomes quickly apparent that Maria does all she can to make her guests comfortable in her home.  Maria is also an excellent communicator and I appreciate everything she did to make our stay so wonderful. 

I do have some advice for future guests, for two different situations, that may make their stay as ideal as possible:  (1) IF YOU ARE STAYING AT THE HOUSE IN WINTER: if the heater seems to be working less efficiently in the living (i.e. if the bedrooms & bathroom are warm, but the living room is not), check to make sure the fireplace flue is closed and the 2 floor vents in the living room are not covered by furniture (one is by the TV and the other is to the right of the front door).  (2) IF YOU HAVE A KID WHO SLEEPS IN A CRIB: I recommend renting a crib from Baby's Away Monterey - if you put the crib in the back bedroom it is further away from the living room (which is good if you are watching TV or talking at night in the living room)... however the back bedroom has the larger and more comfortable bed, so if that is more important to you, you should consider putting the crib in the front bedroom.  

Overall I highly recommend this adorable house!!!  "
1918627,24649476,2015-01-01,4060746,Christina,"Maria was a great host. The house was as expected and thoughtfully put together. There were a few things that could be improved. The fireplace was really hard to light and ended up pouring out smoke throughout the house instead.

We also had to take garbage cans out one day which made it feel less like a vacation. "
1918627,24869835,2015-01-03,24673697,Katrina,"We stayed at the Blue House for New Years Eve with a couple of our friends. It was a great place to just sit and relax and enjoy Pacific Grove. The house is wonderful, the kitchen has lots of room and the backyard was wonderful. Wish we used the fire pit out back, but we stayed inside the warm house instead. We would stay here again."
1918627,25497731,2015-01-18,11798863,Megan,"Maria was extremely communicative and made the check-in process a breeze, we were even welcomed with a bottle of wine! The house was in the perfect location and was beautiful. It was immaculately clean and had everything we needed to make our stay feel like home. We truly enjoyed ourselves at the Blue House and look forwar to returning one day soon!"
1918627,25663791,2015-01-22,7899473,Scott,"Maria's little blue house was exactly what my friends and I were looking for: a cozy home within walking distance of all the main spots in Pacific Grove and Monterey. The house had everything we needed, and was clean and organized. And it had that incredible fire pit outside! Maria and her helpful neighbor, who let us in, were extremely friendly, responsive and considerate. The house even had a binder of recommendations and restaurant menus. The only thing that I was neutral about was one house rule about starting the laundry for all the bedsheets, etc. However, all the other rules were basic etiquette and common sense (don't be intimidated by the list; most of it consists of helpful instructions). And do note the additional fee outside airbnb (the city's 10% transient tax).

My friends and I would gladly return here for our next lazy beach trip. "
1918627,25742674,2015-01-25,209250,Stu,Maria's house was a lovely spot to enjoy all that the Monterey Peninsula has to offer. The house is on a quiet street yet close to everything. The aquarium passes were a big hit for our two year old! The kitchen was great for prepping home cooked meals and the rest of the house was cute and comfortable. We will definitely be back!
1918627,26027798,2015-02-01,17499638,Brian,Nice place as described.  
1918627,26104784,2015-02-03,15619295,XinFeng,"It's safe to say most people who rent a vacation home want their getaway home to be clean, centrally located, well-stocked up, and comfortable. Well, our family hit jackpot with Maria's Blue House in Pacific Grove.  It's supremely clean. So clean that the parents have no qualms putting our baby in the bathtub with us and we've never never done that outside of our own home. The location is within short walking distance from the grocery store, cafes and restaurants. It's about maybe four or five long blocks from the beach. Quiet neighborhood. Easy parking. 
When we arrived to settle in with our two kids, we quickly observed how attentive and thoughtful the host is. She had EVERYTHING one might need in a vacation home. In addition, all the small special touches throughout the house. Our family has travelled all over the world and while this may not be the most luxurious, this is one of the most comfortable, cleanest, and special homes. Maria was very responsive and easy to communicate with.  Wonderful energy and genuine. So happy we've found a place to keep going back to Monterey. "
1918627,26164915,2015-02-05,1891896,Allegra,"We were thrilled to discover pacific grove and highly enjoyed the house. It was quaint, charming and walking distance from downtown Pacific Grove. Pacific Grove is a family oriented town that most tourists miss when they go to Monterey and Carmel.  It is right on the water near the entrance to 17 mile and is a very family oriented place. We definitely used the aquarium passes Maria provided and saved $80. I highly recommend the house and the area for a few days of vacation!"
1918627,26302823,2015-02-09,16261090,Steve,Our stay was very soothing and comfortable. The house was very inviting and relaxing. My wife and I enjoyed our stay. I can actually say it was a very well need vacation and Maria's home gave us that getaway we were searching for. Thank you Maria for such a peaceful weekend.
1918627,26485480,2015-02-14,24299998,Jeanne,"We enjoyed our stay very much, Maria was very welcoming and left a nice bottle of wine and beautiful flowers to greet us. The house is in a very quiet and friendly neighborhood and yet it only takes 5-10 minutes to walk the four blocks down to Lighthouse Ave. where there are plenty of restaurants and shops including a grocery store. But all you'll need is perishables like milk, eggs, bread, meat and produce because the place is stocked with everything else you'll ever need to prepare any meals. The beds were comfy and the shower was great too. The only problem was I didn't want to leave. We will definitely go back. thanks Maria"
1918627,26794486,2015-02-19,2139827,Anna,"My parents stayed in the Blue House and had a wonderful time. They thought the home was well appointed and very comfortable and they loved the town of Pacific Grove. Maria's recommendations for dinner were excellent too. They were able to walk to the aquarium from the house, but it is not around the corner. They would definitely highly recommend staying here."
1918627,26889604,2015-02-21,20487864,LeUyen,"Lovely house, beautiful set up, very warm and quaint.  The neighborhood was wonderful as well, just a short distance to the main streets and the water.  With two little boys the walk to the aquarium was perfect, and the passes made for a great time.  Only a little problem in getting the stove to work, but overall just a great place for a weekend getaway."
1918627,26981415,2015-02-23,14422468,David,Maria's listing is located in a great part of Pacific Grove.   She is also very easy to coordinate with.
1918627,27378074,2015-03-02,9288474,Sander,Our stay at the blue house was marvelous. Maria is a great hostess she gave us many tips about what to see and the house is just like in the pictures. Good job Maria!
1918627,27494463,2015-03-06,19897439,Caitlin,"My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights in the Blue House and it was FANTASTIC. The house was clean and came with a beautiful and fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. We were only 5 minutes from the ocean, aquarium, Cannery Row, the 17 mile drive and only about 20 minutes from Carmel by the Sea. We loved the option to grill out and eat by the fire pit which we took full advantage of and we also used the complimentary aquarium passes which saved us $80 (definitely worth a few hours out of your day). We have nothing but rave reviews for this house and we are excited to stay here again someday."
1918627,27641853,2015-03-09,20483384,Changliang,"Maria was super responsive whenever we had questions regarding the travel. She also kindly asked us if she could get us anything in need during her shopping at grocery. When we arrived it was already late night and too dark so we were kind of lost. Then I contacted Maria and she immediately picked up my call and directed me to the right place.

The house was in a very quiet neighborhood so we really enjoyed the peacefulness and had a great stay. The house was clean and well maintained that we already felt it was our own place a few hours after arrival.

The house was very close to downtown, and there were quite a few good restaurants around. It was really convenient.

Overall we had a great time staying there! "
1918627,27846877,2015-03-13,27501824,Lynn,"We enjoyed Maria ' s lovely Blue House especially relaxing in the evenings after long days of exploring the coast. The kitchen is gorgeous and equipped  with everything you might need including spices, herbs and condiments.  Both beds were very comfortable and we slept well. Maria ' s neighbor, Steven, welcomed us and helped us with directions and recommendations. 
If I'm ever in the area again I wouldn't hesitate to say in Maria ' s Blue House."
1918627,28013254,2015-03-16,6827020,Carlie,"The little blue house was a perfect place to accommodate our family. Family friendly highlights include: 2 aquarium passes, wood floors (daughter allergic to most carpets), cozy but open kitchen and living room with spacious rooms, 2 pack-n-plays, a twin air mattress, a bed rail, walk to aquarium, pacific Grove downtown, and beach (bear in mind it is mostly uphill on the way back), outdoor brick laid backyard, even extra toys to play with. Maria is a gracious and informative host. She is prompt with communication and friendly. She makes it easy! The house is extremely orderly and clean with many modern updates including granite in the kitchen and travertine in the bathroom. We would highly recommend this house to families and will choose it again for any future stays in Monterey."
1918627,28470460,2015-03-24,26763068,Brittany,"The house was delightful! Even with 4 girls staying, there was always enough hot water. The firepit was lovely and we definitally enjoyed its warmth throught saturday. The guest passes to the Aquarium were fantastic & a wonderful addition to staying at the house. THANK YOU also for the birthday card left on my car! That was very sweet of you! "
1918627,28584459,2015-03-26,2340585,Sarah,"The blue house was a wonderful experience! Two very comfortable bedrooms and a very modern kitchen and bathroom. The location of the house is perfect, with an easy distance to so many fun things. Maria was very welcoming and helpful with ideas about what we could do in the area. My children and I had a very fun, relaxing and safe stay here. I look forward to visiting again. "
1918627,28643840,2015-03-28,9280206,Michelle,"Maria was very proactive in welcoming us and we checked in without a hitch. The house was as nice as advertised and definitely lived up to expectations. The interior was of high standards and very welcoming with lots of information provided. The complimentary aquarium passes were greatly appreciated and utilised. Location was perfect in a quiet and upscale residential area. 25 mins easy walk to Cannery Row and 10 mins to Pacific grove centre, which had as much to offer as Cannery Row itself. Highly recommended."
1918627,28933040,2015-04-01,3848539,Christine,"This delightful cottage was the perfect base for our 48-hour family vacation to Monterrey.  The house was delightfully decorated - elegant but comfortable, and the kitchen was well stocked with equipment and a fare number of condiments.  Our host left a lovely bottle of wine for us, and we really enjoyed sipping it by the firepit at night.  It's an easy walk to the charmingly sleepy town of Pacific Grove (nice restaurants and great little market with all the provisions you need for tasty meals) and also to Lover's Point - a great place to watch the sunset.  A little over a mile to the Aquarium, we drove 1/2 way and parked for free along the waterfront and enjoyed a 1/2 mile walk past sleeping harbor seals.  Maria was a very responsive host, willing to let us arrive early and she answered every question.  We would definitely stay here again!"
1918627,29032183,2015-04-03,5008484,Vikki,"The Blue House is a cosy, charming, spotless and well-appointed cottage. Maria was a thoughtful and accommodating host who made the two night stay for our family of four easy, comfortable and stress free.

We appreciated the guest passes to the Monterey Aquarium and enjoyed our visit - her recommendations helped us make the most of our brief stay. Pacific Grove is a quiet and picturesque town and we were pleased when we arrived that we chose here to stay rather than Monterey or Carmel.

After having travelled for some time, we really appreciated the large and efficient washer and dryer.
"
1918627,29177535,2015-04-05,7622268,Nancy,Maria was extremely helpful with our trip---she even made dinner reservations for us!.  The little blue house is warm and cozy and very clean.  The kitchen is outfitted for a chef and there was a nice welcome gift.  The aquarium passes are a great deal.  We loved our stay at the little blue house and Maria's graciousness was part of the charm.
1918627,29618802,2015-04-10,29113389,Karen,"Maria was a fabulous host!  She went way above and beyond to make our stay at her charming home enjoyable.  The house was very charming and nicely appointed and was in such a great location in proximity to the beach.  We were able to walk to town and to the beach within a few minutes. In addition, Maria provided us with wine tasting passes and passes to the Monterey Aquarium which was a real bonus.  We had a wonderful time and enjoyed our stay immensely.  We would love to return someday.  Thanks Maria for making our stay enjoyable!"
1918627,30011945,2015-04-16,22765211,Arlene,"The Blue House was our home away from home for six days & we couldn't have chosen a better place.  It was in a quiet residential neighborhood but close enough to the downtown area for an easy walk.  The house itself was lovely and had every amenity that could be anticipated.  Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Maria, she was most helpful and promptly answered all our questions.  We felt that between her and her neighbor, Steve, we were very well taken care of.  We took full advantage of the free passes to the aquarium and spent one whole day there.  That was an amazing perk that was very much appreciated as were the wine tasting coupons for Carmel Valley.  We lived in Monterey many years ago and come back frequently and would not hesitate to stay at the beautiful ""Blue House"" again."
1918627,30144786,2015-04-18,6530951,Monica,"We had a wonderful time at the Blue House.  The house was immaculate and comfortable , has everything you need . The  space is exactly as pictured and Maria was a wonderful
host . She answered all of our questions  promptly and helped us plan a great stay. We would definitely return to this property."
1918627,30292319,2015-04-20,27962470,Sarah,"We stayed at the Little Blue House for 2 nights, and it was a lovely stay.  The house was beautiful, even more spacious than in the pics (large rooms, big kitchen with nice appliances).  The back patio with fire pit was lovely.  The house is within walking distance of town and the beach, we just parked our car and walked all weekend.  Maria was lovely and very accommodating.  She gave us wine tasting passes to many tasty wineries, and restaurant recommendations.  I would definitely stay here again, and will be telling all my friends!  "
1918627,30445187,2015-04-22,50610,Anna And Brian,"Maria was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions we had.  The house is well decorated, comfortable, and clean.  We had such a relaxing time!"
1918627,30918321,2015-04-29,2756547,James,"Huge thank you to Maria for letting myself and my partner stay in your 'Blue House'.
It was perfect for us. The location for activities and food could have not been better and as we ran the Big Sur marathon it was great to have all of the home comforts.
This is one of the top places we have stayed using AirBnB and will hope to be back. 
House was spotless through out, Maria responded to all questions quickly and fully. 
Would definitely recommend this place to stay to anyone.
Thank again "
1918627,31069809,2015-05-01,6201725,Leslie,"We were very pleased with the house, location, value...Maria (our Host) was quick to respond to our questions and requests and very proactive with offers of support before we even asked. Really appreciated everything The Blue House, Host and Pacific Grove had to offer. We'll be back. "
1918627,31425317,2015-05-05,4557122,Theo,"Again an AirBnB jewel. The Blue House is equiped with everyting you need, you feel already at home when you park your car in the street. Maria was not able to meet us, communications thru the AirBnB site. With only wifi during our travel we were lucky to see the massage where the key was. Even more when you enter. Perfect beds and very quiet. Location is great, Pacific Grove is a nice little place. Lots to do, been whale watching and kayaking. Monterey aquarium and canery row in walking distance."
1918627,31570125,2015-05-07,1776548,Howell   (Alex) (Buddy),"The house is exactly as the photographs show it to be. Excellent location on a quiet street. It is completely updated, comfortable and charming. We highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area and would return in a heartbeat."
1918627,31708773,2015-05-09,14570447,Emily,"The house is well stocked and comfortable, you can settle in and feel right at home!  Maria was a responsive host, and we would definitely recommend the house as a great place to stay in Pacific Grove. 
Thanks Maria! "
1918627,31898694,2015-05-11,17889480,Diego,"Spent mothers day with the family at the Blue House and it was everything we were hoping for!
Great location, clean and exactly what the pictures depicted. We enjoyed some wine, and much needed relaxation! Maria was very kind when we left our movie in the DVD player - she went and returned it to Redbox for us. She was helpful and attentive through the entire stay. 
Ill stay there again if im in the area !"
1918627,32087822,2015-05-13,794859,Kirsten,"This is such a great rental! Beautiful wood floors throughout, fireplace, modern kitchen, and a fire pit! The host (Maria) was so lovely in all of our communication and responded within minutes. The location is great. You can see the ocean from the house and it's a short walk down the hill to a spot where you can actually see otters, dolphins and whales out at sea! This is a great spot. Great restaurants, coffee and thrift stores all within walking distance. And a surprisingly low rental fee. We will hopefully stay here again, next time we're in Monterey."
1918627,32157300,2015-05-15,3212724,Dorothy,This was a nice home in a nice neighborhood within an easy drive to multiple tourist attraction. The house is a half mile walk to lover's point and to shopping and dining. My two sisters and I loved staying at the Blue house. The wine tasting passes were much appreciated. 
1918627,32456550,2015-05-18,858008,Kassie,We enjoyed our stay at the Blue House.  The kitchen was a nice place to cook and we were walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove and the Ocean.  It was conveniently located.  The house itself was clean and comfortable.
1918627,32703557,2015-05-20,31862698,Sherry,"We really liked staying at this quaint house.  Maria was welcoming and prompt with replying to my inquiries on the house.  She was very accommodating to an earlier checkin that I requested as well.  The house is child-friendly, so great for young families.  Please note that aquarium tickets are not included in the stay any longer."
1918627,32815454,2015-05-22,29189011,Xiao,"这是一栋梦幻温馨浪漫的房子,房东Maria特别贴心,准备了家里需要的一切设施,屋里屋外都美丽自然,到海边去的路上也可以逛逛漂亮的街景,太美了!Thanks."
1918627,32988557,2015-05-24,6853609,Daniel,This was a delightful stay! Spacious lovely house with absolutely everything you need! Highly recommended! 
1918627,33424240,2015-05-28,24664819,Jo,"Maria was a great host from the start, answering all questions very promptly.  The property and area is picture perfect and a 10 minute walk down to the beach. The aquarium is further - around 20 minutes. We are on a bit of a US road trip and I think the aquarium will be the highlight for our 5 year old son!

The house was clean, well equipped and had a good house manual.

Maria kindly made us a reservation at the Fish Wife, we all loved it. 

There is loads to do locally, I just wish we had had more time. My favourite was seeing the sea lions basking in the sun at Point Lobos Reserve.

Thanks Maria!
Jo and family, Newcastle, UK"
1918627,33778482,2015-06-01,28839219,Jay,"Where can I leave 6 stars?

Maria was very accommodating and the Blue House was perfect for our family weekend getaway.  My family felt very save in this quiet section of Pacific Grove.  It was an easy walk to the coast and downtown area for my retired in-laws.  The open space in the living room and kitchen was perfect for our 1 year old to explore.  Maria is a great host and we would not hesitate to book another weekend if we are staying in Pacific Grove again.  Don't forget to ask about the secret toy chest for the little ones!
"
1918627,34130512,2015-06-05,11278387,Michael,"Maria's house was as described, clean, well stocked and welcoming. Location was good but you will need a car to et to most things. For any avid runners out there, there are a couple great running or cycling loops from the house - down to love point around the peninsula to 17 mile drive to bird point (restrooms) and back to juniper st or any variation. Cyclists can circle the 17 mile drive from the house via coast then back on stevensons road, a quiet downhill cycle through forest and lovely homes. Passionfish and bistro Moulin are two highly recommended places for dinner. Bikes can be rented (with baby trailer) cheaply from cannery row. We had a two year old with us and house presented no challenges. For those wishing to cook at home the kitchen is very well stocked by Maria. There is a nice outdoor area too and playground close by at end of juniper st for the little ones. "
1918627,34528143,2015-06-09,12431249,Mary,"My husband, daughter, and I had a wonderful 4-night stay at the Blue House.  Maria's generous hospitality was evident even before we arrived, but when we walked in we found many thoughtful touches: a bottle of wine and glasses set out on the table - coffee, creamers, and many cooking supplies stocked - bathing products set out for use - a beach umbrella ready at the door - etc.  It was even nicer than advertised and we would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone else visiting the area.  Lots of great restaurants and coffee houses nearby, and a very quiet neighborhood.  "
1918627,34837280,2015-06-12,35027617,Charlie,"We left San Fran headed to the Monterey area at 5 o'clock PM and on the way searched the Airbnb site and found Maria's home in Pacific Grove. We booked it and Maria was able to get us in the house shortly after we arrived. She is very pleasant, the house was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood a few blocks from the quaint town of Pacific Grove. She even brought us back a bottle of wine and coffee after we had settled in. In summary, it was a great two nights. "
1918627,35367503,2015-06-18,28059994,Jessica,"The blue house was absolutely amazing! My fiancé and I stayed here for a few days for our elopement and Maria made it so special for us. She was very responsive, sweet and had great recommendations for restaurants. In addition it was so nice to arrive to a personal note, a bottle of wine, flowers and a congratulations banner over the fireplace. The house itself was gorgeous and very comfortable. It had everything one would need and was a short walk to the beach. We walked almost everywhere. I would recommend this place to anyone! Thanks again Maria"
1918627,36513188,2015-06-29,4255752,Debbie,The listing description was accurate... Good photos... And you can see from the map that it is centrally located.

All the thoughtful touches and nice (and CLEAN) furnishings really made us feel like we were at home. Maria, you've done an amazing job with this place. We can't wait to come back!! "
1918627,38106010,2015-07-13,9118148,Sadie,The host made us feel very welcome. She even left us homemade salsa!  She was very quick to respond to our questions.The housing description was very accurate and was in a very cute neighborhood.  Pacific Grove is a delightful beach town to visit. 
1918627,38479701,2015-07-16,2801755,Debolina,"The Blue House was perfect for our family!! We have a 3 year old and a 6 month old daughter. This was our first time going away as a foursome and staying at the Blue House allowed us to have such a comfortable and wonderful time in Monterrey. Maria was a tremendously gracious host and made the most delicious salsa! She provided us with helpful family fun recommendations. 

Our 3 year old felt at home and so did we. Everything that a family with a baby and toddler might need was provided. We will definitely be back! Thank you Maria for a wonderful holiday."
1918627,38703885,2015-07-18,12236208,Anders,We had 2 great days at the Blue House - Maria was a great host and very service minded and easy to contact if help needed. The house is located very central and we can highly recommend this please to others. 
1918627,39267260,2015-07-22,25394581,Rob,"We felt very welcome at The Blue House.  Upon arrival, there was a clean, beautifully decorated house and a local bottle of wine waiting for us.  Maria also left us some delicious organic salsa that we thoroughly enjoyed.  The Blue House had everything we needed.  Maria has thought of everything - including small details.  We greatly appreciated having local menus available to us - complete with some recommendations.  In addition to being a beautiful home, The Blue House is located in an area full of natural beauty that we greatly enjoyed having the chance to see.  We highly recommend this place and would definitely come back should we ever find ourselves in that part of the world again. Thanks for the lovely stay. "
1918627,39591609,2015-07-25,24322320,Ann,Het huis was zoals het weergegeven is op de foto's. 
1918627,40151658,2015-07-28,38466560,Amiya Ketan,Maria was the perfect host. She provided some top tips and then left us alone to enjoy the gorgeous property and the spectacular surroundings. It so happened that our stay coincided with the 'lantern festival' a 100 year old tradition celebrating the history of settlers in the region. There was a delightful performance and fireworks down by the beach. Highly recommended. Seamless logistics and furnishings in the property were of an excellent standard. 
1918627,40388392,2015-07-30,33073742,Steve,"Great location in a wonderfully relaxing town - exactly what we were looking for. Maria was on vacation, but made sure that a neighbor greeted us and was available if we had any questions."
1918627,40649570,2015-08-01,12450241,Betsy,"Lovely home, exactly as described.  We did not meet Maria, but her neighbor Steve was most welcoming.  The house is charming and comfortable, and is so close to everything, we could walk and bike everywhere we wanted to go."
1918627,41056775,2015-08-04,25269914,Daniel,Lovely house and wonderful town! One of our absolute favorites during our three week long vacation in California. We were greated with a nice bottle of wine which was a very nice surprise. The Aquarium and free passes were also great!
1918627,41307687,2015-08-07,12479715,Steven,The place is great! Maria was extremely communicative and we hope to be staying again if we're in the area!  
1918627,43208854,2015-08-18,21851885,Terry,"Maria, our host was great.  Had wine waiting for us.  The house was everything as posted online.  Cute and cozy, large picture window looking out on a quiet neighborhood."
1918627,43547371,2015-08-20,31755547,Somin,Maria was a GREAT host! The house was well equipped and it was just perfect size for four members of my family. I let Maria know that we are celebrating my father's birthday so she gave me local favorite restaurant recommendations and put up a 'happy birthday' sign in the house! She also left us a wine for us to enjoy:) We really felt like being home and spent memorable three days at this place. We would love to come back! Thank you!
1918627,45054483,2015-08-31,27677305,Marco,"Das blaue Haus ist ein Traum. Maria hat es mit soviel Geschmack und Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet, dass man sich von der ersten Sekunde an rundum wohl fühlt. Es ist alles sehr sauber und gemütlich. Wir haben in unserer Reise leider nur 2 Tage im blauen Haus eingeplant. Im Nachhinein wären wir gerne noch länger dort geblieben. "
1918627,45379342,2015-09-02,34420919,Iain,This is a lovely comfortable home. It's around 10 mins walk to pacific grove where there are a few shops and restaurants. The beach and aquarium is a short drive away. We really liked it and would definitely go back.
1918627,45664921,2015-09-05,30452875,Eileen,"Maria's blue house was perfection. We felt right at home immediately and could have stayed much longer. The house was stocked with everything you could need from coffee to laundry detergent, delightfully decorated, and very clean. And the location! Walking distance to the ocean, restaurants, even a movie theatre. And all in a charming, quiet neighborhood. We couldn't help but talk about what it would be like to live there full time. 

Maria herself was bubbly and sweet and so helpful. We even got to meet her two darling kids. 

Highly, highly recommend a stay here!"
1918627,46114457,2015-09-08,7787041,Rick,"This is our second stay at the Blue House, and again, everything was perfect! 

Maria is responsive and her hospitality is as good as it gets. The house is in a great location, has beautiful amenities/decor, and it was clean. 

We would highly recommend the Blue House to anyone and hope to stay there again soon.  I'd give it 6 stars if it were possible :)"
1918627,46463395,2015-09-11,19774505,Vicki & Dave,"Maria,
Thank you for the use of your beautiful home. We couldn't have wished for anything more, everything we needed for our short stay. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay for longer. The house is in a great neighbourhood close to the centre of Pacific Grove and only a short distance from Monterey. The house is very well equipped and communication with our host went very smoothly.
We had a fantastic time and are already planning our return visit.
Thanks again
David, Vicki and Sue"
1918627,46859955,2015-09-14,30174143,Veronica,"Hello Maria the petite blue house was amazing, and your host hospitality was one of the greatest. My family and I enjoyed our stay, and I'm sure we will be visiting again.Again thanks for help making this weekend so awesome. Veronica Beckwith"
1918627,47179220,2015-09-16,20578163,Harriet,"The Blue House was a perfect fit for a two night stay as part of a big honeymoon driving tour of California. Maria was extremely welcoming and the house was clean and homely. We arrived to flowers and a congratulations sign strung up on the mantle above the fire. Maria arranged some wine tasting passes for us and was keen to help with any questions. We had a great stay, thank you Maria."
1918627,47456422,2015-09-19,4102800,Melanie,"Maria is a wonderful host. She responds to communications promptly. The house is beautiful, with lovely furnishings, and the kitchen is wonderfully stocked for cooking. It is centrally located, easy access to the Coastal Trail, 17 mile drive, wine tasting and the aquarium. I have no complaints."
1918627,48057765,2015-09-23,25794491,Lauren,"We had a great experience in the Blue House! Maria was a great hostess. We were there for our wedding weekend and she had a bottle of wine, a congratulations banner and a little bouquet of flowers waiting for us! Maria was very attentive to us during our stay. She always answered questions in a prompt manner. We absolutely loved the full kitchen equipped with basic spices. Maria made it very easy for us with all of the informational signs around the house too. I would absolutely stay in the blue house again! Thank you Maria for a comfortable and quaint house! We loved the neighborhood, it was very convenient to the store as well as cannery row! Last but not least, we had a blast at the aquarium!!! 

Thank you Maria!!!  "
1918627,48265311,2015-09-25,9292697,Jude,"Welcoming,comfortable home from where we enjoyed exploring the Monterey/ Carmel area.
Homely & well equipped with all that we needed.
Would stay longer next time."
1918627,48858359,2015-09-29,1372423,Katie,"Maria was a super friendly host. The house was comfortable and convenient to the beach/grocery stores. 

We would definitely recommend Maria as a host. 
"
1918627,49202818,2015-10-02,28053002,Chad,"Maria was great! she responded to all of my questions in a timely matter. I never had any concerns.
The place was exactly what I was looking for! 
I would stay again and recommend it to all my friends.
Thanks again Maria.

1918627,49597246,2015-10-05,37501704,Miguel Angel,Great place! Loved it! Plenty of space and amenities. Thanks for the wine. 
1918627,49957810,2015-10-07,22171129,Nancy,"Maria was very thoughtful! She prepared baby chair and bottle brush and candy treats and many more stuff for the little ones which made us feel very touchy! The location of the house is unbeatable! Very close to major attractions! Close to 17 miles and Monterey Aquarium! Many restaurants and deli stores! We loved the community and really wish we could stay longer! House is well equipped, and Maria made clear instruction for each and every stuff! Overall, I could not list all good things about the house and the host, Blue house is indeed a plus for our trip! "
1918627,51526969,2015-10-21,31477157,Samantha,"Maria was an excellent host! She was always available to communicate if we had questions and replied very quickly. We were welcomed by a bottle of wine and felt right at home in this cozy, charming house. The neighborhood was quiet and easy to navigate to nearby shops, restaurants, and grocery stores in addition to breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean. If we were to stay in this area again (which I hope we do!), there's no question this home would be our destination. "
1918627,51811744,2015-10-24,46426589,William,Maria was great. Replied quickly to all emails. House was in a great location. Someone was available to help with recommendations around the neighborhood and to assist with any other needs.
1918627,52080538,2015-10-26,5766537,Jennelle,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Maria's home since I hadn't been to Monterrey or Carmel before, but it ended up being the perfect base for our travels around the peninsula! Not only was her house clean and wonderfully decorated, she also had tons of amenities on hand - nice shampoos, great bedding and even bath robes for every guest!

It was easy to explore Monterey/Carmel/Big Sur from Maria's place - something I wasn't sure about when I booked the location in Pacific Grove. Monterey and Carmel are both short rides away, so my family and I were able to enjoy the pleasures of both towns. We even took a day trip down to Big Sur national park, which is about an hour away. Thanks Maria!"
1918627,52345202,2015-10-28,4135591,Yonathan,"Maria's house was fabulous and we felt really welcome in it!
The description was extremely accurate, the location was great and Maria provided everything we looked for in a vacation in Pacific Grove.
She even left us some chocolates.

If you're looking for a vacation home in Pacific Grove - look no further!"
1918627,52525581,2015-10-30,27522532,Stuart,"Had a great stay at the Blue House. All communication with Maria was quick and easy. The house itself, was very nice, clean, and comfortable. A great location for exploring the area. I really enjoyed my time in Pacific Grove and would thoroughly recommend this listing."
1918627,53081300,2015-11-04,47335973,Pamela,"This house is a gem. Very comfortable and in a great neighborhood. Maria was delightful and responsive to questions and making sure our visit was enjoyable.
I would highly recommend this as a great vacation. Hideaway. Thanks Maria.
 "
1918627,53452720,2015-11-09,11347457,Jocelyn,What an adorable little house! Great location - you can see the ocean as you drive down the road approaching the house. Everything was perfectly clean; the house has great energy and is decorated in very good taste. The host even left a bottle of wine for us :). Such a great experience - I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some peace and quiet or just a really nice place to stay. 
1918627,54163851,2015-11-16,5180693,Christian,My family and I really enjoyed Maria's home. We were pleasantly surprised to see a bday banner near the fireplace because we were celebrating my wife's bday. That was really thoughtful! The home was really comfortable and really close to all the restaurants and shops in pacific grove.  It was such a nice little vacation. :). The only thing I would critic was the slow wifi service other than that everything was awesome. Thanks for having us. 
1918627,55182870,2015-11-29,37179821,MaryBeth,"I love this house! I stayed for 4 nights, Thanksgiving week, with my husband and my sister. We had a lovely holiday here.
Maria was a wonderful host, always answering my emails promptly. I am sorry she was out of town when we stayed there so I did not get to meet here, but her friend Steven took care of everything. We arrived to find fresh flowers on the table, and a bottle of wine set out for us. The house was so warm and comfy - the decor was a mix of antiques and modern pieces, with touches of whimsy. All very tastefully done.
The kitchen was amazingly well-stocked with many pans, utensils, spices. We were able to cook our own Thanksgiving dinner easily.
The neighborhood is lovely and well maintained; the business district a short walk away with some fine restaurants. Our favorite was Pacific Thai restaurant on Lighthouse (fabulous Thai food!), and we also had good dinners at PassionFish and a Japanese place on 17th St, whose name I am forgetting.
We enjoyed our outings every day, but we really enjoyed ""coming home"" to Blue House.
Thank you so much, Maria!"
1918627,55544251,2015-12-01,11729278,Meredith,"Maria was very communicative and though she was not there to greet us, we were still able to get into the apartment seamlessly by her neighbor. The little blue house was very cute and comfortable. You would definitely want a car staying here, though if you're a fit person could walk to the aquarium/town without one. It was a nice little getaway. Thanks!"
1918627,55740931,2015-12-05,49384283,Susan,"We had such a great girls getaway in the Blue House. Maria was great! The house was very comfortable. I only wish we would have stayed longer.
We will return!"
1918627,55956623,2015-12-07,9558617,Andrea,"Maria's home was a great place to stay. Very warm and cozy place that made us feel at home. Maria was very easy to communicate with and very responsive. The home is in a convenient location, close to the town and the beach, and in a very quaint and quiet neighborhood. The backyard was a great place to sit and relax, and my friends and I really enjoyed using the BBQ in the back. We had a great stay, thanks Maria!"
1918627,56490327,2015-12-14,1201521,Jillena,"Maria was a fantastic host.  We've been lucky to find the best stocked homes on airbnb, Maria's amazing home was no exception!  Everything we needed and more.  The house is cozy and in the heart of  Pacific Grove, you can walk Everywhere.  We had little interaction on our 2 night stay, evidence of a pristine home and needs anticipated. She really is in the super host category. Felt like home, but way better."
1918627,57504087,2015-12-27,33031856,Lucas,"We were so stoked the moment we walked in. Tastefully decorated for the Christmas holiday (we stayed Xmas eve and day) really nice updated kitchen with everything you'd need, plenty of room for our son, walking distance to a lot of things and Candy Cane Lane for holiday experience. Easy check in and will definitely come back. "
1918627,57866806,2015-12-30,1330802,Alison,"We really enjoyed our stay at the blue house, it was the perfect place to stay when exploring the area nearby. The house was well stocked with everything we needed and perfectly comfortable for 4. We didn't meet Maria, but she was very easy to communicate with via email and her neighbor promptly welcomed us when we arrived to check-in."
1918627,58495145,2016-01-03,24287358,Mike,"A number of days in the blue house near the sea was fabulous. The house is the most charming ever in a lovely neighbourhood with restaurants and shops near by. In all fairness we felt like not going away much because of the nice house, yet Monterey and its surroundings are very much worth a visit because of the beauty of its marine environs. 
By the way, the house was well equipped for a good stay, it was clean and had all we needed as a family of 4.
If we go back to Monterey, we shall happily ask Maria again for the possibility to hire the Blue House."
1918627,58769404,2016-01-05,54776,Holly,"The space was great for two couples, easy to navigate given the numerous tips & reminders. We particularly enjoyed grilling & relaxing on the back patio. We could walk to restaurants and the market, and even the aquarium was an easy (downhill on the way there) walkable trip. Highly recommend Pacific Grove and Maria's home."
1918627,59284099,2016-01-09,5200652,Carl,"Everything was perfect, and just as described. The Blue House itself is memorable and comfortable and offered us a perfect base from which to explore the surrounding areas (e.g. Big Sur, Carmel, Point Lobos, Monterrey, etc.) with our children (ages 2-5, for whom the house proved very kid-friendly). The walk to Lovers Point Park and beach is pleasant (though plenty of parking makes driving more convenient if hauling gear). Maria was an excellent host, readily available if needed, and provided a great deal of information about the house and about things to do and see in the area."
1918627,59508411,2016-01-11,33760220,Amy,A very nice weekend....the house was nicely stocked and perfect for a weekend get away. 
1918627,59693417,2016-01-14,34474647,Victoria,My husband and I were newlyweds spending our honeymoon in Pacific Grove/Monterey and Maria's lovely blue house was the perfect place for us to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.  Maria was excellent at responding to us and checking in to make sure we had everything we needed.  Her home was lovely and we loved being able to have a nice fire and make meals in the very well equipped kitchen! Thank you so much Maria for being such a lovely host!
1918627,60003007,2016-01-18,14057066,Shannon,"The house was beautiful in a quiet location, had all the amenities we needed and was set up with such a welcoming feeling. It was so restful and lovely for my husband and I. "
1918627,60210125,2016-01-20,20658220,Eun Young,"The Blue House was a very cozy and conveniently located place. Well equipped kitchen and spacious place for 4 adults to stay.  The neighborhood is also very quiet and only few mins driving from Safeway and Trader Joe's. We did not get a chance to meet Maria in person but she was very communicative. 

I would highly recommend this place :)"
1918627,60455661,2016-01-24,209250,Stu,We had another wonderful visit to Maria's house. It is perfect for our annual family/work trip to the peninsula. Great access to all the area has to offer and a very comfortable well appointed house. Maria is a wonderful host and goes out of her way to make us feel comfortable. We will be back!
1918627,60700989,2016-01-26,48309101,Lynn,"This is our first time using Airbnb, we are so glad to choose The Blue House. Everything's look like as described. We didn't meet with Maria face to face, but it's convenient that we keep in touch with messages. I've already recommended to my friends!"
1918627,61155376,2016-02-01,48607931,Todd,Thanks Maria for a marvelous experience at the Blue House!  Everything was just charming.  We would definitely recommend the Blue House to friends!
1918627,61624794,2016-02-07,5298034,Ben,"We loved the Blue House - just as beautiful as the photos and lots of thoughtful touches.  It was warm, comfortable and homely and we didn't want to leave!  We didn't meet Maria, but she was very attentive and keen to ensure that our stay went well.  I was really glad we chose Pacific Grove, a lovely neighbourhood and easy to reach the more touristy Monterey by car.  We'd definitely choose to stay there again."
1918627,62693689,2016-02-16,12093674,Karen,"Our stay at the Blue House was amazing. The house was very clean,  super cute and in a convenient location for walking to downtown Pacific Grove or the Monterey Aquarium area. Maria was very sweet and checked in with us throughout the trip to make sure we were happy and enjoying our stay. I would highly recommend staying at the Blue House if you are traveling to the area. 
"
1918627,62975463,2016-02-19,48514864,Nicole,"We had such a wonderful stay that we didn’t want to leave! The house is just as cute & cozy looking in person as it is in the pictures. The house it is located in a quiet little neighborhood walking distance to the beach, shops, and restaurants and a quick drive to the aquarium. The kitchen was well supplied with everything you could possibly need from pots & pans to spices & condiments (even had bamboo skewers, which saved us a trip to the store). The living area was cozy & we loved the fireplace. We were actually glad it rained on our last night there so we could enjoy it. The bedrooms were nice & there was plenty of extra bedding & pillows in the closets. The bathroom was stocked with good shampoo & conditioner, q-tips, and little extras. Our favorite was the backyard. Having a BBQ was great and we loved the fire pit. Thanks Maria!"
1918627,63696199,2016-02-26,7636590,Laureen,"Our stay at maria's ""lil"" blue house, as we affectionately call it, was nothing short of fantastic! the ""lil"" is more of a term of endearment, than a description of the size of the house, as we had 4 adults and a little baby and found it to be, to borrow a phrase from golidilocks, ""just right""...

maria made us feel like ""family"", from the beginning; emailing us to ensure that we had everything we needed and offering to help us find things to do and places to go, in the area, to make our stay complete.

the description on the airbnb site was spot on... the only thing i would say, is that the ambiance of cheerful homeyness, while exuding an air of clean, relaxing sophistication... can not be described in words! you just have to see and experience it for yourself!

upon our arrival, we were met by steve, who helps ""care-take"" the property... very friendly and helpful but, like maria, was very respectful of our space and privacy. (which, even if we saw maria, more than the one all-too-short visit that we both set up to meet each other... would have been ok... heck, i would have adopted that girl ""on-the-spot!"")

the high chair and ""pack-n-play"" for the baby, that were provided by maria, were terrific and gave us the feeling that she was 100% behind this being a successful family gathering!

i am an avid cook and the kitchen, which was one of the reasons that i chose the lil blue house, was everything i could ask for... including a very cool italian range/oven! i managed to cook my heart out, while there, which was the plan, so i was one happy camper (or ""b-n-b'er)...

thank you maria.. and steve , for your attention to details that made my family's stay so special! we are hoping to come back, again, to start a tradition of lil blue house ""getaways""..."
1918627,64875787,2016-03-08,18615396,Anthony,Maria was a great host and gave us some great personalized local travel tips. The house is perfectly proportioned for 4 people (two couples) and full of character. The beds were a little on the soft side but some people like that I guess. Plenty of parking right outside the house and just a short drive into town. 
1918627,65716397,2016-03-16,50687081,Megan,The blue house was absolutely charming. Pictures were completely accurate and location was amazing. We wish we could of spent more time here and hope that we will be able to return. Maria was very helpful and prompt to respond.
1918627,66023493,2016-03-19,30215102,Steven,She was great.  There was a bottle of wine waiting for us and the place was spotless. She went out of her way when we made a mistake in our booking.
1918627,66673177,2016-03-24,4744585,Mark,"The blue house is in a great location. It's an easy walk to the beach and it's on a nice, quiet street. There are lots of instructions so you never have to wonder where things are!"
1918627,67577901,2016-03-30,24941,Michele,My family and I had a wonderful time. The cottage is absolutely darling and very clean. Excellent location and wonderful amenities. 
1918627,67822155,2016-03-31,48157287,Kathy,We had a great stay at Maria's house. It was beautiful inside and out. Special attention to details in the kitchen and bathroom were appreciated. Proximity to town and local attractions was nice. Beds are comfortable and the house is very quiet. We would stay again. 
1918627,68322772,2016-04-04,11732208,Rebecca,"We had a great time at the Blue House! Maria was warm and welcoming, and the house is very cozy and comfortable. "
1918627,68725241,2016-04-06,4616652,Kathleen,Maria was a great communicator and graciously offered her assistance with tips on the area. We really appreciated how child friendly the house was. We visited with our eight month old twins and were grateful that Maria had a high chair and pack n plays available. Bonus was the rooms have dark curtains which made for better napping and sleeping at night! The location is great for walks to downtown Pacific Grove and a quick drive away from the main attractions. Thank you!
1918627,69069905,2016-04-09,16671529,Rob & Michelle,"The blue house was a charming little house with every amenity to make you feel at home. It is in a great location and walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove, the aquarium and Ocean View Blvd walk. We loved that it is so central to Carmel-by-the Sea and a short drive to our all time favorite, Big Sur. "
1918627,69856862,2016-04-14,15462687,James,"Lovely place, with nice original furniture and comfortable beds. Well equipped kitchen, good wifi, smart tv etc. We didn't get to meet Maria, but she was a friendly and helpful host. Pacific Grove is beautiful and I highly recommend a visit. We had a great stay :)"
1918627,70458502,2016-04-17,11659487,Katie And Elliott,"Stayed here over a weekend with family. The Blue House had everything we were looking for! Great location with a beautiful walk to the beach. Excellent location that makes it easy to get around on foot or by car for longer distances. The house itself was in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Amenities are excellent and house is fully stocked for easy cooking and laundry if necessary. We loved this house and would gladly return. "
1918627,70659494,2016-04-19,14748624,Tyler,"Maria's Blue House was everything we wanted. Exceptionally clean, spacious and the perfect size for the 4 of us (2 couples) to relax and enjoy the Pacific Grove area.  We were unable to meet Maria, but her directions were clear, and her responses to our (very few) questions were quick and helpful. 

Maria clearly has a lot of experience using this house for Airbnb and it shows. Instructions and rules for housing use and cleanliness are clear, and Maria creates a warm and welcoming environment for visitors. She loves this space and expects us Airbnb-ers to feel the same way. 

The only (very minor) drawbacks are (1) the separate Pacific Grove TOT surcharge and (2) the somewhat slower-than-expected internet speeds (~1.5 MB).  However, Maria is up front about the TOT, and the Internet access is adequate for general surfing and lighter video streaming. 

In short, we loved our (all-to-short) stay at the house, and would wholeheartedly recommend it  to anyone staying in the  area."
1918627,70988655,2016-04-22,8881688,Andrew,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Blue House. Maria was a pleasure to work with, her communication and kindness before and during our stay was much appreciated. She checked in on us and offered some great tips for the area. The house was conveniently located being a short walk to downtown Pacific Grove and the water. It seemed like everything else was a 5-10 minute drive away, so we went to Monterey and Carmel multiple times.

The house itself was very cozy and comfortable. It was in a quiet neighborhood and was really relaxing. All the amenities you needed was provided in the house. There's nothing more we could have asked for. We highly recommend Maria's place and hospitality!"
1918627,71430329,2016-04-25,25606549,Michael,"Four of us (two couples) needed a place to stay in Monterey because a friend and I were running the Big Sur Marathon. We lucked out and found Maria's ""Blue House"". Great location and close to everything we needed. Maria was very accommodating and quick to reply to any questions that we had. The house itself was beautiful and we loved everything about it. Everything that we could possibly need was provided for us, we only wish that we could of stayed longer."
1918627,71728949,2016-04-28,37438010,Walter,We loved our stay in Maria's cosy cottage with family guests from Europe ! It's an excellent location to explore the Carmel and Monterrey coast area. The cottage was very well equipped and was a great combination of modern and old style for a 100 year old cottage. Maria was very responsive during the booking and check in process offering timely suggestions for sightseeing and restaurants . We would return again without hesitation and recommend this highly. 
1918627,73067601,2016-05-06,62008516,Brittany,"The house was perfect and just as described. I have a 7 month old and traveling isn't always easy but Maria had a high chair and pack n' play ready for us, which was awesome. Weather wasn't all that great but we explored during the day and lit a fire and enjoyed some wine at night. Can't go wrong with this rental. "
1918627,74031488,2016-05-12,32568478,Matthew,What a lovely house. What a lovely area. What an amazing host!! We talky couldn't have had a better time staying here. A perfect location and great place to stay. Highly recommend!
1918627,74488877,2016-05-15,29706044,Jason,Maria was very communicative in advance of our stay and during our time at the house. The cottage was clean yet homey and in a great location. It was just what we were looking for. 
1918627,75148667,2016-05-19,40730621,Steve,Maria had a welcome note and a bottle of wine waiting for us. Instructions about the home were clear.

1918627,76483028,2016-05-27,10696219,Daniel,"Maria's house was just as described and delightful to stay in. The neighborhood is a perfect central point amidst all of the sites in the area. Parking our car was easy and safe, directly in front of the house. The interior was clean and neat, and felt very cozy and familiar. She even left us a bottle of wine and decorations to commemorate our wedding anniversary. A very sweet touch from a very great host. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Looking forward to it."
1918627,77062563,2016-05-30,11984293,Chuck,"The blue house is amazing! It is spacious and has a great open feel. The beds are comfy too! 

Maria is a great host. She communicated with us promptly and answered any questions we had via the app. The neighborhood is awesome. We walked down to the beach daily. I would definitely recommend this place!"
1918627,77541335,2016-06-01,62509227,C,"Had a marvelous time at the house!!! Too bad we could only stay for 3 days in this charming, dreamy house! I was a bit worried that we'd have to arrive to a dark house since we got in late; but lo and behold!!! We came home to a house with  the porch light turned on and lampshades turned on, too inside the house. Thank you!!! The house was clean, well-kept, and ideally located. Would love to come back again."
1918627,77907757,2016-06-04,19776475,Edwin,"The blue house was beautiful, much more than we expected. It was so charming that we thought we'd just stay indoors during our trip to Pacific Grove. Too bad we only had 2 nights there. Maria was a fabulous host who was so sweet to prepare everything we needed in the house and recommend places to eat around town. Hopefully we would be able to come back again and book this place for a longer stay. "
1918627,79024302,2016-06-10,26067771,Jay,"This beautiful getaway is a priceless little jewel in Pacific Grove!  I stayed there with my wife and two teenage daughters and felt at home instantly.  Maria takes great pride in her property, and you were treated like a personal guest.  Walking distance to very cool restaurants and the ocean. The highest recommendation!"
1918627,80535076,2016-06-18,40300233,Gigi & Rick,"We had a fabulous stay at the Blue House. The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and so close to town. Parking was never an issue, and the house had everything we could possibly need, including nice bathrobes, a hair dryer, and tons of kitchen amenities. Maria was great to work with and always made sure we were very comfortable. We especially enjoyed the grill, the fireplace, the large TV, the washing machine (and detergent), and incredible shower pressure. We will recommend the Blue House to friends that ever travel to that part of CA. "
1918627,81870600,2016-06-25,56537782,Bethany,"Maria was super helpful and communicated well. We never got to meet, but she's a fantastic hostess. "
1918627,82746263,2016-06-29,5900823,Karen,"Maria's house has everything you need.  There was nothing missing.  She even provided us with a welcome bottle of wine.  That was nice! The beds were comfortable, the bathroom clean, the kitchen fully equipped.  The neighborhood extremely quiet.  The town is close by to walk to.  The beach however is a bit further than we thought so we did not walk but it is a very short drive.  All and all the house is wonderful and we would stay again.  Thanks for a wonderful visit Maria. "
1918627,83004629,2016-06-30,38861872,Anthony,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Blue House! The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful and close to the beach, local restaurants and of course the aquarium. We will definitely be staying here again. the house is most accommodating and most of all, Maria was on top of everything and anything we need assistance with. Moving forward we will probably always stay at the Blue House when visiting Monterey!!!"
1918627,83681708,2016-07-03,38855904,Brenda,The Blue House definitely lived up to its high reviews. We loved how quiet the neighborhood was. It was a lovely and peaceful getaway from all the noise and traffic of daily life. I personally loved that the home came equipped with anything you could need from pans to toiletries to extra blankets and pillows. It's perfectly placed to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Fisherman's Wharf while not being too far from Del Monte shopping mall. I only wish we could have stayed longer. 
1918627,84665222,2016-07-08,54741690,Peter,"Maria was a wonderful host. Her communication and attentiveness throughout the process was outstanding. The house itself is lovely. It was super clean and well equipped. We enjoyed several nice meals using the kitchen. We loved getting to know sleepy little Pacific Grove and thoroughly enjoyed the restaurants she recommended. In particular, Passion Fish was fantastic. But we also enjoyed Pavel's and the The Red House."

1918627,91289219,2016-08-04,74907576,Andrew,From the first outreach to the checkout Maria was amazing.  She provided regular updates with house rules and then ideas and suggestions for my family.  So warm and helpful leading up to our trip and 2 day stay.  A bottle of wine awaited us and the house was just perfect and near where we wanted to be for our trip... right in between Carmel and Monterey and the local town of Pacific Grove had a great restaurant and coffee shop I went to every morning.  Maria was so accommodating and the house just fit our needs perfectly.. 
1918627,92869220,2016-08-10,18696075,Gem,"We stayed here for two nights, but I wish we had stayed longer! Maria's cottage was beautifully decorated and the bouquet of fresh flowers was a very nice touch and much appreciated -- all the little things make a difference and really sets this apart from our other Airbnb experiences. Maria's communication was stellar and the location was excellent. This is definitely going into our memory bank as one of the best places to stay in Pacific Grove. Couldn't have been more happy with our stay and we hope to come back again. Thank you, Maria, for being such a wonderful hostess! :)"

The kitchen and bathroom must have been redone recently as they were perfect and met all our needs.  The house location is very convenient and the street has plenty of open parking and the neighborhood is very quiet.  We could not have been any happier.  Thanks you so much Maria.  We will be back.
1918627,97797540,2016-08-28,50461492,James,Great place to stay in Pacific Grove very close to town and the beaches as well as the 17 mile drive.  Very cute well equipped house that we felt very comfortable and welcomed for our stay.  I would highly recommend this if looking for a small house to stay for a weekend or week.  We will stay here again when we come back to Pacific Grove.

The house was in fine order, a lovely flower arrangement was there and a sumptuous bottle of wine.  The location was walking distance to the center of town, exactly what we wanted.

1918627,104649278,2016-09-27,8548252,Daniel,"Our stay at Maria's home was fantastic! The house is right in town and walking distance to some great restaurants. You're just a short drive down to the water and the nearby towns are great as well. The house is very clean, and a much better option than staying at a hotel. Maria was a great host. She made sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay with Maria again in the future."

The house is very charming, comfortable and clean. We love Pacific Grove - a pretty, walkable town - and the weather is almost always perfect. Maria's house is a short walk from the town center and its many restaurants and shops. We also walked to the beach and enjoyed the breathtaking scenery along the coast. For a getaway we took a drive up the Carmel Valley. Had a great lunch at Cafe Rustica in the village, and hiked in the Garland Ranch Park."

The house is beyond clean and its little touches and decoration make it warm and welcoming. Maria is a very genuine person from her communication style. Trader Joe's is close by and you can walk to Lovers Point and the aquarium. We will keep coming back!
1918627,117090368,2016-12-04,15396421,Breedeen,This place was great for what we needed--somewhere close to the conference we were attending.

We would stay again if circumstances allowed!

The house is in excellent condition and everything was as expected. We were greeted to the home with a cute bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine. There is also a binder with easy-to-follow instructions on how to use different appliances in the home. The location is a short drive to the major streets in the area for both dining and grocery shopping. Maria was very easy to keep in contact with both before and after our stay. We had an excellent time. "
1918627,125427345,2017-01-05,60342530,Theresa,"Lovely, quiet house in sweet residential neighborhood. Close to town and ocean. Perfect for peaceful walks. VERY clean. Met expectations -- as described. Good communication with host. Easy arrival and departure. Felt support was nearby if needed."
1918627,126532593,2017-01-12,53630853,Sylvia,"This was a cozy place for our family to gather.  The kitchen was well stocked and easy to prepare meals in.  She had things like teas, oils, spices, condiments available. Grocery stores were close by.  The beds were comfortable.  The coast is walking distance and so worth the walk!

The lighting in the living room is dim and difficult to read in.  The Internet service was slow.  But other than those details, it was a great place and space to be.

Maria gets 5 stars for her excellent response times for all our inquiries.  She went beyond what she needed to in order to be helpful to us.  She had a bouquet of flowers and bottle of wine waiting to welcome us.

Her house instructions were clear and helpful. I highly recommend this place!

The house is centrally located, very close to lovers point, Monterey Aquarium etc.

We had a great trip and are looking forward to our next visit here."
1918627,133978039,2017-02-25,5610125,Greg,"We spent 9 nights at the Blue House and had a great stay.  Maria is a great host and certainly deserves her ""super host"" status.

The Blue House is in a great location....close to downtown Pacific Grove and all of the great restaurants and also a quick walk away from the beach.

The house was clean, comfortable and looked just like the photos on the site.  Maria was very helpful in recommending a good dry cleaners as well as local workout gyms.

We'll definitely come back to the Blue House on our next visit to Pacific Grove!"
1918627,135188406,2017-03-03,10283601,Ryan,"A very nice house in a scenic neighborhood about 3/4 mile from the beach. The main downsides are that (1) there are notes all over the house about how to use it, which didn't leave us feeling very comfortable there and (2) there is a $125 cleaning fee but you need to do much of the cleaning yourself. Keep in mind that there is a 10% tax payable to the city that isn't included in your full reservation cost. So ultimately it didn't feel like much of a value. The main upsides are comfort, cleanliness, and access."
1918627,136143837,2017-03-08,12519143,Bettiann,"Maria's home was ideal for our 2-night stay in Pacific Grove as we journeyed down the California coast on a vacation road trip.  We were welcomed with fresh flowers and a bottle of wine.  Everything about the house was perfect for us including a well equipped kitchen for home style cooking, laundry facilities to freshen up our clothing and a warm and relaxing living / dining area.  It was spotless and appropriately furnished.  I highly recommend Maria's place and will definitely stay again if / when we are in the area.  "

The aquarium and the beach are also close and highly walkable. The Blue House is cute and comfortable. The kitchen is more stocked than my home kitchen, making it easy to cook. Maria is an excellent host and provided clear and comprehensive communication throughout the experience. I would highly recommend her place and would stay again!"

1918627,189446242,2017-09-01,33665623,Patty,"We had a comfortable, enjoyable, fun and relaxing vacation at Maria's cozy home! We are a family of four (2 adults and 2 children) and we enjoyed our stay. The location of the home is centralized and in prime location; you are walking distance to the beach, minutes from the Aquarium, restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. Maria was a wonderful host and was very responsive in her communication. The bedrooms were very spacious and had plenty of closet and drawer space for clothes and shoes. The beds were very comfortable.  The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans...just about everything you can think of that you would need to cook; we cooked meals every day and brewed our morning coffee every day as well. The washer and dryer was a great bonus; we did a couple loads of laundry. We were happy that the bathroom had both a shower and tub because our children enjoyed the bath.  We brought our DVDs and enjoyed a movie on the big flat screen TV! By the way, Pepper's Restaurant has delicious tacos and splendid cocktails! Maria stocked the house with every amenity you can think of and was such a wonderful host that we intend to return. We hope you enjoy your vacation as this very cozy home and much as we did! Cheers!"

The house was comfortable and clean and had everything we could think of! Loved our stay and would happily come again."
1918627,203272445,2017-10-14,38044303,Eric,"The Blue House is very well located to gain quick access to downtown Pacific Grove, Lover's Point, Asilomar and the rest that the Peninsula has to offer.  It was a short walk down the street to Lover's Point and the coastal walking trail.  Cute house and everything you need inside!"

1918627,211688299,2017-11-13,10850835,Kali,"Beautiful home in a great location. Walking distance or just a short drive to about anything you’d want to see in Monterey. Yet also positioned in a quiet neighborhood that’s away from the tourist hustle and bustle.
It was as very clean and thoughtfully stocked with all the essentials and creature comforts. Not to mention it was very family friendly!
We already want to plan our next trip!"
1918627,212406977,2017-11-17,57807489,Xinxin,The blue house is amazing!这个蓝房子真的很美 位置很好 到海边只有步行2分钟的距离 安静 整洁并有历史感 Maria很友好 始终及时的回答所有的问题 还给我们准备了红酒和花 超级推荐
1918627,213894503,2017-11-23,120255813,Roy,You will enjoy this charming home. All the amenities you could ask for. Maria is a very accommodating host. The location of her home is an ideal stay when choosing Pacific Grove as your destination because it is so acessible to downtown and Cannery Row and Monterey.
1918627,214885679,2017-11-26,125845404,Francesca,"The Blue House is so utterly charming.  This was the perfect Thanksgiving getaway for my mom, sister and I.  It is walking distance from Lover's Point, which has sandy beach alcoves, benches for relaxation, bicycle rentals, and gorgeous panoramic views of the ocean.  It is also just up the street from Lighthouse Blvd., the main street through Pacific Grove with tons of shopping, eating, the Pacific Grove Natural History Museum, and a sweet, historic cinema!

If you are more active, this location is also walking distance (1.5 miles) from the lighthouse, monarch butterfly sanctuary, the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, and Cannery Row.  

The house is very well stocked with most of what you think you will need - shampoo, q-tips, towels, cooking oil and spices, etc.  The dining table sits in front of a beautiful bay window, which adds to the charm.  And the house has many brochures regarding different attractions in the area so you don't need to stop at a visitor's center or tourist bureau!  

We would definitely stay here again.  I forgot to mention the best part - we never had an issue with parking around the home, which was very convenient for the area!"
1918627,215282560,2017-11-28,1224914,Karen,"We had a great stay at Maria’s house. Perfect location in Pacific Grove that was easily walkable to shops, restaurants and the ocean. The house was very well equipped with whatever you may need. Would highly recommend staying here!"
1918627,215802671,2017-12-01,11288504,Barry,Maria's house was perfect for our stay. It was clean and spacious. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. We always had parking in front of the house.
1918627,216425578,2017-12-03,15396421,Breedeen,This was our second time staying at the Blue House and--just like before--we had a great time. Maria is quick to respond to questions and was very welcoming. She left us a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates to enjoy. The location is within walking distance of restaurants and shops and there was plenty of street parking available so we didn't have to worry if we needed to take our car out to go further afield.
1918627,217315941,2017-12-08,114791136,Cathy,Thoroughly enjoyed Maria's place and the surrounding area. Was great to be able to walk to things nearby. Maria's guidebook was very helpful. We had everything we needed for a wonderful vacation.
1918627,218005667,2017-12-10,130350819,Susan,"The blue house is charming, well-appointed, and very comfortable. The neighborhood and location are great - walking distance to Pacific Grove’s quaint downtown and the beach. Maria is very responsive and hospitable, thinking of all the details that make a stay at the blue house special. When my family and I pulled up to the house on Friday evening, we were delighted to see the outdoor decor and Christmas lights turned on, welcoming us. The inside was also tastefully decorated for the holidays, adding to the festive ambiance. The blue house is wonderful and I would stay there again."
1918627,218746298,2017-12-14,24481167,Michael,"Beautiful place in a perfect location. Cozy, comfortable, and well done. I hope we can stay again sometime!"
1918627,219145745,2017-12-16,61399095,Gill,"Its a lovely house.  We were only there one night from about 9 pm to 7 am the next morning, so we don't have much else to say."
1918627,219523990,2017-12-17,6530781,Nancy,"While we only stayed one night at Maria's house, we found it to be a very cute home with many amenities in a good location."
1918627,220531979,2017-12-22,5288562,Victoria,"Pacific Grove is a really nice little town—its just a pleasure to be there. One of things that made it so great was being able to stay in the neighborhood, amongst all of the sweet little houses and cottages. That’s the main thing we enjoyed about this stay—Maria has set up a lovely home that makes you feel like it’s your own. You can walk to shops and restaurants in just a few minutes, getting in and out of the house is a breeze, and there are some lovely touches in the home itself. We recommend!"
1918627,221203858,2017-12-25,28425275,Joyce,"Lovely location, great walking distance to downtown and beach. Loved the fireplace and cozy, almost a cottage. Full size kitchen was great for our family dinner!"
1918627,221796857,2017-12-27,25373597,Bonnie,The home is exactly as described — and that is more than enough!
1918627,222440458,2017-12-29,13279645,Angela,"Lovely home with lots of charm. Kitchen has all that you need for cooking, including a stocked pantry (olive oil, ketchup, seasonings, etc.) 
Sunny rooms and a nice backyard with fire pit. 
On a quiet street with easy parking. Bakeries and shops in walking distance. 20minute walk to the aquarium, 10minute drive to Alvarado street. 
Unfortunately the beds are old spring mattresses and we found them very uncomfortable. If the mattresses were updated we’d stay again for sure."
1918627,223127278,2017-12-31,20981443,Jared,"Great place close to the water, Monterey Bay Aquarium and shopping."
1918627,225228761,2018-01-05,40619179,David,"The ""little blue house"" is truly charming. It's in a perfect location - very close to restaurants, the beach, Monterey Aquarium, Carmel, etc. The house is clean, well appointed, quiet and the perfect place for a family like ours."
1918627,226097778,2018-01-08,3944168,Jonathan,"Check in and communication with Maria was very easy.  The house was very comfortable, and her instructions on all systems were very complete.  This is a quiet neighborhood just blocks from great dining options and the beaches.  We found everything we needed and more -- the hostess even left us a bottle of wine for our arrival -- such a nice welcome!  If we decide to escape to the Monterey Bay area again we will definitely choose Maria's home for our base."
1918627,228446976,2018-01-19,10104523,Michael,"As most other reviews have already described, Maria's place is a beautiful, comfortable cottage near all that you would want to do in Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel. It was the perfect central spot for exploring the area with our 2-year-old. We enjoyed walking to Lover's Point and restaurants on Lighthouse Ave. The kitchen is also well appointed if you want to cook a meal in. We definitely recommend Maria's place in Pacific Grove!"
1918627,229302062,2018-01-22,120453070,Susan,We had a wonderful stay at the Blue House in Pacific Grove. The house is cute and cozy and the location is amazing. Walking distance to town and beach. There is a great bike and walking path along the shore that we really enjoyed. Maria is responsive and accommodating.
1918627,230033848,2018-01-26,49022127,Francisco,Such a lovely place. You have to know it. Lindíssima casa. Tudo muito limpo e cheio de estilo e com mimosos detalhes. Uma garrafa de vinho e dois passes para o Aquário de Monterrey como cortesia.  Dois quartos grandes. Não perca a oportunidade de se hospedar aqui.
1918627,230682012,2018-01-28,56429848,Ben,"Maria was a perfect host. Fast responses to everything, thought through everything we might need, and even added some personal touches. I booked this spot for my parents, and although they have been to Carmel and Monterey dozens of times, they experienced it in a completely new way this time. Came back raving about their trip. Would absolutely recommend Maria's spot! "
1918627,231778183,2018-02-02,71575008,Jen,"We had a wonderful 5-night stay at Maria’s. It was my husband and me, plus our 2 year old. Maria set us up with a playpen, high chair, child dishes, bottle racks for the dishwasher, etc. We loved having a full kitchen to use, so we cooked a lot of our meals at home! We also enjoyed sitting out on the back patio. The house was the perfect place for us to stay as we explored Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, etc. We felt so comfortable there. We went to the Farmers Markets on Monday and Tuesday and they were great! The aquarium is a must-do. We took our toddler to the Dennis the Menace park twice, he loved it so much. We had an amazing trip and hope to return!"
1918627,232652836,2018-02-05,56559329,Mike,"This place is cute, has everything you might need, had a terrific location, and a host who was responsive and cool.  Good spot."
1918627,233235128,2018-02-08,164885984,Fanfan,Thanks for Maria’s consideration for our stay. The house is easy to find and the decoration is very nice although the house is for hundred years. The daily necessary with high quality and we like the blue house very much. The famous views such like lovers point are about 10minutes walking way. The ocean view is really nice and we enjoy our staying very much. thanks again to Maria and her stuffs.
1918627,234691319,2018-02-13,25761196,Laura,"The Blue House is a sweet little cottage, wonderfully appointed with everything you need to be comfortable. The house is on the corner of two great streets and is still the cutest house around.  Just a short drive (or long walk) to the aquarium.  Maria is a helpful and responsive host.  We only got to stay one night and wished we could have stayed longer."
1918627,235447868,2018-02-16,7730744,Sarah,"Maria’s place offers a great location and house. A house and kitchen with everything you’ll need. 
Maria offered great tips and was super helpful. 
The house is walking distance to the town and beach. 
A beautiful area with Carmel and Point Lobos being real highlights!"
1918627,236269049,2018-02-18,114667996,Landon,"Beautiful home, fantastic host. Stayed with 3 friends and loved the space so much we spent an evening in as opposed to exploring the town! Thanks Maria!"
1918627,237383607,2018-02-22,163078458,Dylan,"It is a great house, with a fabulous kitchen. If you cook, you'll want to stay at this place. We stayed with our 2 year old son and found it to be family friendly (while still having nice decorative touches out of his reach.) It's 6 minutes by car away from the aquarium. It was very clean and Maria is an excellent host. This is my first Airbnb experience and I'm guessing that Maria went above and beyond the norm. She was easily available for questions and checked in before and during our stay (non-intrusively via message on Airbnb.) We will definitely be staying here in the future."
1918627,237634449,2018-02-23,146208722,Howard,It's a warm and sweet house. Hope be back soon!
1918627,238766224,2018-02-26,22953516,Danielle,Maria's place is great - can't beat the location! It was wonderful to be walking distance to many shops and restaurants in downtown Pacific Grove as well as Lover's Point. We also enjoyed the outdoor area with fire pit and the large kitchen. Perfect size for four of us on a girl's weekend.
1918627,241325052,2018-03-08,58406622,Alberto,"We stayed in Maria's place as a family (one teenager). It was wonderful, charming and very comfortable. We loved seeing all the marvelous sites around and then coming back to such a welcoming place."
1918627,242367078,2018-03-11,1139042,Steffi,"This was an absolute gem--a clean, private, well-decorated home just steps from wonderful restaurants and shopping made our trip so enjoyable. We slept comfortably and had everything we needed to relax. Maria is a lovely, welcoming host!"
1918627,242896420,2018-03-13,27050595,Taylor,"Maria’s house is adorable - wonderfully decorated with a large & fully stocked kitchen. The house is within walking distance to tons of restaurants and to Lover’s Point beach, which is an adorable area with great views. The hosts were quick to respond to all questions and provided many recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. Would highly recommend!"
1918627,243649895,2018-03-16,81441508,Robert,Maria and the little blue house were perfect.  We had a great time in the area and it was great to have a cozy home to come home and watch a movie each night.  Everything was as promised and Maria was so helpful before and during the trip.  We would recommend and stay again if we come back to the area.
1918627,244852119,2018-03-19,171667755,Laura,"Great stay, easy check-in and check-out, very comfortable cottage!  A bottle of wine, fresh flowers, and coffee beans ready to go in the freezer were nice touches!"
1918627,245813932,2018-03-23,173859745,Tim,Great place and location. Tv reception was spotty.
1918627,246982739,2018-03-26,4716760,Rachel,"This was a perfect location for us.  Just a few blocks from a sweet little downtown with everything you would need, and a few steps further to the ocean.  The house was perfect for our family of 4, and if we get back to Pacific Grove again, we'll hope to rent this house again!  The owner left a lovely bouquet and bottle of wine for us, which was above and beyond my expectations!  I highly recommend this rental if you want to experience all that Pacific Grove has to offer."
1918627,249156341,2018-04-01,164749014,Jason,"Maria was an amazing host. She was quick to respond to our questions and made our stay absolutely amazing. Her house is gorgeous and the proximity to the surrounding beaches, restaurants, and activities is unmatched."
1918627,250952665,2018-04-06,36004882,Lindsay,We had a fabulous family trip! Great location and lovely home... cant wait to come back!
2079346,227692282,2018-01-15,1653846,Amanda,"We had a great stay at Merry's this weekend. I believe we're the first to stay/review so I'll try to be detailed.

The views were gorgeous; just as shown in the pictures. We got up and out early each morning so I didn't spend any time lounging on the balcony admiring the view, but I wish I did. The house was filled with cozy blankets and all the necessities. I realized too late there were two twin mattresses in the closet we could have used for our kids (instead of the little cots we brought for them). The king size bed was a bit firm for me, but spacious and warm. The kitchen felt a little sparse but really has all the standards - I think the only thing I couldn't find was a measuring spoon but I made due just fine. (And it's nice that it clearly isn't just a dumping ground for all the random kitchen gadgets someone no longer uses...) The shower was nice, perhaps low for someone tall, and the extra half bath on the entry level is helpful. Everything was clean and taken care of.

The location is great - we walked down to the ocean view walking path and looked at the harbor seals and otters on our walks down the aquarium. It was an easy 10-15 minute walk both to downtown Pacific Grove and the aquarium.

There were 4 of us on our trip - my husband and I and our two kids (ages 3 and 5). I'd say the place is best suited for a couple or a group of friends, but it worked just fine for our family. Since it is a loft, there are no doors to close so we kept it quiet and darker downstairs after our kids went to bed. All in all, it's a great place and I would happily stay here again."
2079346,232646311,2018-02-05,28067875,Leonie,"This spacious apartment is in a great location between the centre of Pacific Grove and the Cannery Row area. It's very spacious for a couple, well supplied kitchen and lovely small balcony area. Communication was great. We would happily return and spend a week!"
2079346,255192352,2018-04-19,5000400,Nuala,Super quick responses. Beautiful location. Lovely place.
2118041,10443731,2014-02-18,3041100,Nikki,"What a wonderful hostess Faye was! We had the most pleasant experience staying in her beautiful home this past weekend. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with tea, a spacious room with a queen bed, a home-cooked lunch, brand new towels, and warm conversations :) Faye was so kind and accommodating throughout our stay. She felt more like a friend than a hostess. Each morning, she had breakfast waiting for us in the kitchen. Although Faye does not drink coffee, she knew my boyfriend and I were - so this amazing woman went out of her way to buy a coffee machine (with Starbucks coffee beans!) for us the next morning of our stay! I mean WOW :) You don't find awesome people like that everyday! I would definitely stay with her again and recommend her to anyone wanting a spacious, private and warm place to stay in the Pacific Grove area. Perfect for anyone wanting to explore Big Sur minus the inflated prices you find in that area (about an hour drive - worth it!) Thank you Faye for everything! You are awesome."
2118041,11338220,2014-03-30,9727758,Chris,My friend and I had a wonderful stay with Faye and her family.  Very nice room and location.  We used it as a stopping point on our way to Big Sur and definitely enjoyed it!
2118041,11378036,2014-03-31,12851917,Quanquan,"Faye is a very nice hostess. She not only provided me comfortable accommodation, and also delicious breakfast, recommended Carmel By the Sea and 17 Miles to me, it really was a great recommendation. Her house close to 17 miles really, it is with excellent location. She helped us to solve some difficulties in our journey, I thank Faye and her family very much for offering us all the help. I sincerely recomend the people who visit Carmal stay in her house."

2118041,11942678,2014-04-19,6816024,Martin,"People like Faye are the reason why we like airbnb so much. Her clean place is sited in a quiet neighborhood. We slept through by open windows. When there, make sure to take the 20 minutes walk down to Spanish Bay."
2118041,12582193,2014-05-05,14696771,Alex,"Faye and her family were very friendly and welcoming, despite our late arrival and early departure necessitated by our scuba diving course.  Their house is spectacularly clean and the bedroom is comfortable and very dark with the blinds closed, which was key to a much-needed afternoon nap.  "
2118041,12674637,2014-05-07,11199322,Cornelia,To stay at Fayes home was just great. She and her familiy are living very closed to one of the most wonderful beaches we have ever seen: the spanish bay. She hosted us very gentely and the bed was one of the most comfortable we've ever sleept. We definitly would spend another night there.
2118041,13327370,2014-05-25,15549391,Wolfgang,"Faye is a very friendly host, and everything will be fine in Faye's house in Pacific Grove. This location is perfect to visit Monterrey, Carmel or Big Sur. I would like to came back."
2118041,13361881,2014-05-26,14672186,Fanny,"非常享受此次的住宿, FAYE的熱情招呼, 舒適的住房, 絕佳的地點, 總體就是一個""讚"", 謝謝FAYE~  期待下次再相會."
2118041,13446400,2014-05-27,3090197,Daniel,"Good location a stone's throw away from 17-mile drive.  The room was clean, but the house really lacked the warm, friendly nature of other places I've stayed through AirBnb.  Dark house / closed door vibe / no hot water in shower / thin walls.  Every restaurant closed by 930.  Next time we'll stay in Santa Cruz.  "
2118041,13643002,2014-06-01,4027382,Hang,Faye and her husband made us a very pleasant stay. We did a last minute booking and Faye responded very quickly. The house was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends.
2118041,14002208,2014-06-09,11630587,Hala,"We had a wonderful stay here! Amazing location, really. And a beautiful home. Faye really went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. We wished we could have stayed longer there, not just because of how clean and nice the home and neighborhood were, but because Faye was really very welcoming. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're in the area! Thanks again Faye :)"
2118041,14325883,2014-06-16,13579588,Hayden,"Right near the 17 Mile Drive, 5-10 min drive to cool restaurants and 10 mins to Monterey aquarium. The house/room is well furnished, and the host and her partner are very nice people. We stayed just the one night, however there are multiple rooms on air bnb here so there may be a shared bathroom. "
2118041,14400063,2014-06-18,15367362,Yujia,"We really appreciate the warm welcome and hospitality of Faye in the late evening. Besides, the dinner, breakfast, and the choices for different kinds of food and fruits are also good and impressive. Regarding the facility, both the bedroom and the bathroom are large and very clean. In addition, you could probably spend quite a few hours in the pleasant living & dining rooms reading or talking with Faye about Monterey. Lastly, I would recommend a minimum 2-day stay here for a complete and joyful experience around Monterey."
2118041,14544067,2014-06-21,16357933,Yihong,it is very nice stay at Faye's home. Faye is a very nice host. The hous is at a good location. Faye keep everything in the house tight and nice. I will definitely come back next time.
2118041,14589088,2014-06-22,15796059,Mira,"We appreciate the very warm and friendly welcome! Faye and Bill are very kind and sweet, Faye responded almost immediately on my request. The bed was absolutely comfortable and the bathroom very clean. We enyojed breakfast together and she gave us a few tips for our upcoming trip.
5 minutes Drive to monterey Aquarium and 17miles drive! We would definitely stay there again! ;) thank you! 
"
2118041,14753587,2014-06-25,5295075,Leslie,"Location is good as a short drive to downtown Pacific Grove, and the beach.  The room is functional, as described.  Bath is very  nice, but shared is sub optimal.  Bed was comfortable and night was quiet and conducive to sleeping.  The common area was spacious, but we did not choose to use it.  Faye, our hostess, was very friendly and accommodating of our arrival time and readily available for questions about the local area.  We stayed only one night as we were passing through town."
2118041,14942598,2014-06-29,12741449,Bo,"The place was clean, roomy and had everything we needed. The house is close to the bay with supermarkets nearby. Faye and Bill were very nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place for the price of $100 per night! "
2118041,14979960,2014-06-30,4611163,Janice,"Faye was a very warm and hospitable host, and made sure we had a comfortable stay. Thank you for the great experience, Faye!"
2118041,15221996,2014-07-05,16019393,Wei,"Faye and Bill are such nice people! They were amazing hosts. The room was in excellent conditions and we were provided towels, tooth brushes, slippers and other necessary items that you might have forgotten to bring. The neighborhood is nice, quiet and very close to Monterey downtown as well as the 17 Mile Drive. There's an area just across the street from the house that you can park at. Faye even made us breakfast in the morning. We made a last minute change to our trip and wanted to add one more person to this 2-people room and she was so flexible with it and only charged us $10 more and provided an extra small bed. Faye is the sweetest lady that I have met and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. You will have a great time in Monterey staying at their beautiful house."
2118041,15280408,2014-07-06,16538615,Robert,"We stayed for 1 night at Faye's place and we really liked it! Faye is a wonderful person! She made our stay really comfortable and prepared us a good breakfast! 
The location was perfect, nearby the 17-mile drive!"
2118041,15361284,2014-07-07,91784,Katharine And Brendan,"We were disappointed with our experience at Faye's and would not stay there again. It wasn't a typical BNB experience in that it reminded us of staying at a hostel: the walls of the bedroom were very thin and it was consequently noisy at night, the bed was uncomfortable, and there was no hot water in the morning for a shower. On a more positive note, the bedroom and shared bathroom were very clean. In addition, the bedroom had it's own lock and key for security."
2118041,15829824,2014-07-16,11529777,Shaowu,"房东是一个非常善解人意的女主人。我们到她家的那天,已经很晚了,她不仅在门口迎接我们,还给我们做了晚餐,使我们有了到家的感觉。第二天的早上,她又早早的为我们准备早餐。当她发现我们的脸有晒伤时,她又把自己的防晒霜送给了我们。还给我们介绍加州一号公路上的景点和路线,使我们有目标的进行浏览,房东女主人对我们的贴心照顾,使我们非常感动。有机会再去那里,我们还住她家。她的家是完美的,干净整洁,设施齐全,家周围环境优美,距17英里海岸很近,可以徒步浏览17英里的海滨风光。毫不夸张的说她的家是旅行者的首选。"
2118041,16217119,2014-07-23,9784645,Daniel,"Faye was very welcoming and friendly. Location is very good to Pacific Grove, Monterey and surrounding areas location. She let us store items in the refrigerator and even returned (mailed) an electric tooth brush that I had forgotten. "
2118041,16485631,2014-07-28,16222222,Lachlan,"Faye and her partner Bill went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They offered helpful advice for activities and Faye cooked eggs for breakfast each morning. Their house is in a great location just outside Monterey on a quiet suburban street. We had a car so this was perfect for us. The photos and facilities were exactly as described, and the room was large and comfortable."
2118041,16644761,2014-07-30,18423163,George,"Faye is an excellent Hostess and went out of her way to show me a little bit of Monterey, California. This is a quiet home in Pacific Grove and the room was nice and comfortable. I highly recommend this as stop over in the Monterey area."
2118041,16805019,2014-08-02,4345387,Jordan & Angela,"Faye was very nice and welcoming. She made us breakfast, was always available and made check-in/out was very easy. Her place is in a good location and has lots of parking. We would recommend Faye's place for someone staying in Monterey area."
2118041,16921113,2014-08-04,16192174,Reynold,"Faye did a wonderful job of welcoming us to her home. The location is quiet and very comfortable. In the morning, we had a wonderful breakfast and fascinating conversation. The room was very lovely and everything was as described. A great stay."
2118041,17029493,2014-08-05,17779658,Peter,"Faye and her husband Bill were very friendly and courteous hosts. They even took their time to drive us to Monterey downtown 
and to show us a nice place for dinner. Next morning Faye cooked an excellent breakfast and shared some time with us while recommending
us worthseeing spots around Monterey. We enjoyed to stay for one night in their clean house. We highly recommend this wonderful place. Not only for one night. Peter and Max"
2118041,17307668,2014-08-10,18956584,Zheheng,Great host! Spacious room. I'll definitely visit next time.
2118041,17364676,2014-08-11,13357904,Dennis,"We had a pleasant night at Faye's home. She was an caring host and served a wonderful breakfast.
The room was cozy with a comfortable bed, just as expected. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. 
Her home is about 15 minutes by car away from the warf.

Thanks Faye!!"
2118041,17491296,2014-08-12,18539267,Karin,"The experience at Faye's home was great! It is located in a beautiful area and you can walk to the spanish bay which is 15min far (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a really nice promenade to the Beach!!
The room was clean and extremely comfortable:) Faye and Bill were very nice!!They helped us with everything and they prepared a delicious chineese dinner!
We will recommend it for the next visitors!!!!"
2118041,17517310,2014-08-13,7608187,Maria Pia,"Faye is very friendly and affectionate, your home is located in a nice neighborhood, very quiet and close to everything. The room is very comfortable and clean. We were surprised with a very good breakfast, like home !! ... if you visit all the peninsula, highly recommend it, you'll have everything nearby and you get a good deal."
2118041,17584085,2014-08-14,18933617,Stephanie,"Faye was very warm and welcoming.  Her place was clean.  She provided us with fresh towels,  fresh sheets and made us breakfast in the morning.

She is located very close to the water & many shopping & dining places nearby.

This was our first airbnb experience,  but definitely not our last! "
2118041,17632997,2014-08-15,17655669,Jean,"We had a very pleasant stay with Faye!  The room was clean and the house was quiet.  In the morning Faye made us breakfast an we ate with her and the other guest.  Faye showed us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium only a few minutes drive away and got us in at a discount!
Thanks Faye for making our first airbnb experience a great one!!"
2118041,18038643,2014-08-20,5784806,Kristen,Faye was a lovely host. She made sure we were comfortable during our short stay and keeps a very clean home. 
2118041,18085843,2014-08-21,9680159,Mathilde,Very nice place and location and very nice welcoming ! Faye was very nice showing us around and explaining about the bathroom troubles. She made our stay easy ! 
2118041,18187637,2014-08-23,14442612,Helen,"Faye's was in the perfect location, it was easy to get to the main streets and navigate. The room is clean and spacious and perfect for  resting after a day of running around town with wedding duties. She was very accommodating and very hospitable during my stay. I arrived a bit later on the first night, and she made sure to connect with me and go over details about the room and shared bathroom. I would have loved to spend more time enjoying her company and the area but I was on a tight schedule for wedding preparations. "
2118041,18286867,2014-08-24,2597105,Jim And Marnie,The room was clean and as described.  Faye was an extremely gracious host and fun to talk with.  The hot water for the shower was slow to come on.
2118041,18329196,2014-08-25,17880820,Lukas,"Faye had a nice house and cozy rooms for a perfect stay in the Carmel area. The city center was close, and she was a great host! Thank you! "
2118041,18533301,2014-08-28,4311164,Varanjeet Kaur Maricarmen,Faye is ever sweet lady!! I really enjoy to meet her! For sure I'll back next time!! The place is nice!
2118041,18812622,2014-09-01,19000850,Sankalp,"Faye and her husband Bill, were excited to receive us and made us feel at home. The room was exactly as shown in the listing. The bathroom is shared, but just a step outside the room. Faye made scrambled eggs for breakfast. The house is very well located in a secure and quiet neighborhood, with easy access to all the tourist spots. It's just a few blocks away from Cannery Row and Spanish Bay. This was our first airbnb stay and we are excited to relive the experience. "
2118041,19381054,2014-09-11,20433589,Diane,"Fantastic location.  Pacific Grove and beaches are gorgeous.  Faye is very friendly and made a good breakfast and shared her kitchen and living room and telephone very graciously.  Large room with a lot of storage space. However, she did not mention that her step-son also shares the bathroom with the downstairs guests, that his door opens up into the bathroom which he often leaves open and also leaves open the door to his room.  He acted hostile when he thought we were looking into his room or wanted to close his door to the bathroom. So we didn't feel comfortable there. He also  comes home late from work and for light sleepers it woke us up, as well as hearing people talking in the kitchen/living room which was right near the rooms.  The upstairs bedroom is probably quieter and more comfortable.  Also, the hot water in the downstairs bathroom shower ran out very quickly one morning and another morning never got warm.  It appears if someone takes a long shower that it takes about a half hour for the water to warm up again.  She needs to also add to her house rules that everyone has to take off of her shoes inside and wear slippers. The house was too cool a temperature for a southern Californian."
2118041,19581719,2014-09-14,12765172,Kathrin,"Faye and her husband were really nice and kind during our stay. Faye even picked us up because we didnt find the place. It is not in Monterey, but in Pacific Grove. So you might want to have a car to get around. Breakfast is included, but you have to share the bathroom. All in all, a very nice couple to stay with."
2118041,20400713,2014-09-28,6985107,Carolina,"A very simple place to stay in Monterrey, but clean and well located. Great to have the free passes to the Aquarium that Faye offer. Thank you, Faye!!"
2118041,20577389,2014-10-01,7539274,Sarah,"Faye is a very kind and loving host. 
My boyfriend and I stayed at her house in a room downstairs for 2 nights. 
The Room itself was very clean, bathroom was ok.
We were almost never at the house,since we were busy exploring the wonderful countryside. The free passes to the aquarium were great and Faye made us breakfast. Yummm.

Bottom line: if you are ok with sharing your bathroom (step son) then go for it! :)

2118041,20986596,2014-10-09,16689228,Jojo,"有一位中国房东真的好,全程就在这吃到最想吃的了,距离17英里很近,去往Carmel也不远,很适合中国游客歇个脚!"
2118041,21125519,2014-10-12,1690368,N. Brooks,"Faye was a very friendly host, as was her husband. The house was clean and our double bed was comfortable and bathroom had a nice shower.
We really just slept here, as we were in town to join our family for a family reunion, and we took all meals with our family. It was a 2night stay. "
2118041,21569217,2014-10-19,1826492,Julie And Ankit,"Faye was a great host and her place is very well located. You can walk to 17 mile drive from her place and enjoy a leisurely stroll on the beach! If you have already done 17 mile drive I recommend doing this to avoid the $10 entrance fee. She makes a great breakfast and is very friendly and helpful. I will say that the house does have thinner walls, so if you are a light sleeper, this may not be the best place. Otherwise, it's a great place."
2118041,21815030,2014-10-24,1891332,Fabriann,Faye was very accommodating and welcomed us to her home. She even offered to make us breakfast! The room is clean and exactly as it looks in the photos. We loved the option to go visit the aquarium! 
2118041,21935030,2014-10-26,10923804,Evan,Faye was very pleasant and welcoming. We picked up the free aquarium passes and used them the same day. A wonderful place to stay in Monterey.
2118041,22481761,2014-11-07,21867430,Ivan,"Faye And Bill were very nice hosts! The place is very confortable. The breakfast was very nice! Faye also borrowed the hair dryer to my girlfriend. We'd stayed for one day, And It's a perfect stop if you want to go to the aquarium, since It's include And has breakfast :-)"
2118041,22573673,2014-11-09,6844649,Ed,Faye was great and very welcoming.  The room was as described and looked like it does in the picture.  The house is nice and very convenient to 17 mile drive and the aquarium.  The 2 aquarium passes worked great and allowed us to avoid waiting in line for day tickets.  The room and bed were comfortable and Faye even made us breakfast in the morning.  Great stay.
2118041,23303259,2014-11-28,13130833,Di,"We arrived on Thanksgiving Eve. Faye made us feel super welcome. She offered us a flavorful dinner on that night and a filling breakfast the next morning. She has good personality. We had a pleasant chat after dinner. She even invited us and another guest for tea and shared with us some home-made raspberry pie. We got the aquarium passes as promised. It is so useful because they are membership cards that allow multiple entrance. Thanks to those passes, we had a chance to eat at a nearby local restaurant without worrying about re-enter the aquarium."
2118041,23351566,2014-11-29,6032803,Eric,Great visit and I enjoyed the breakfast as well as the company!  Certainly will return here if ever in Monterrey again.
2118041,23404415,2014-11-30,3071815,Howard,Faye was very warm and welcoming. She made breakfast for us and had a set of tips for us in traveling around the area.
2118041,25531193,2015-01-18,24747509,Jay,"Faye was very nice, accommodating, and friendly. She even waited for us to wake up so she could make us breakfast :). There was also a lot of helpful information about the area left in the room. I would definitely stay with her again."
2118041,26267699,2015-02-08,26649652,Eri,The location was very close to Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the 2 free passes that came with our stay were very convenient as we didn't have to wait in long lines to get in! The room was very clean and roomy
2118041,26488783,2015-02-14,24036274,Adelaide,"Faye was an excellent host. We had an easy night's stay in Pacific Grove. Safe, quiet location. Friendly hosts!"
2118041,26537365,2015-02-15,24224952,Jojo,"It was very memorable experience staying at Faye's. Her home is located in a convenient spot with walking distance to 17 miles and Spanish Bay. 2 minute's driving to Monterey Bay Aquarium where we spent a lovely afternoon there. It was Golfing final so no one can get into 17 miles without certain pass but with Faye's help, we successfully got there. Thanks very much, Faye! And also thanks for making us delicious breakfast! I'd highly recommend her place to anyone who plan to come to Monterey. "
2118041,26666117,2015-02-16,19318980,Joanie,"Faye was not home when we arrived but her husband was very welcoming and knew exactly when to expect us. We wanted to use the aquarium passes on the day we checked out instead of the day we checked in and she was very accommodating- she said as long as she did not have other guests the following day, we were free to use them and returned them the same day. She also went out of her way to drive into town with our other guests to give them directions on their plans that day. Definitely going above and beyond.

The location of the house to the aquarium was less than a 10 mins drive down the same street and very easy to get to. The parking lot across the street to the house allowed for easy parking at night, although there are no street lamps to light your path from the parking lot back to the house so be cautious about walking through the grass area. 

Everything is as depicted in the pictures in the listing except the rooms were not as bright as they appear online- perhaps it was because we came later in the day. 

Overall, this was a hassle-free stay that made this weekend a memorable one."
2118041,27977128,2015-03-15,393960,Amar,Faye was great! She was very accommodating and kind. I really enjoyed our stay. I would come back if in the area again.
2118041,28420954,2015-03-23,28784139,April,We had a wonderful experience staying with Faye! We stayed in a lovely room with a TV and plenty of storage space. The bathroom was enormous and she provided us with towels. Everything was neat and clean and the atmosphere is quiet at night. Faye is very sweet and very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again if I were in the area.
2118041,28742812,2015-03-29,1356384,Kelly,"Thanks to Faye's arrangement, we were able to stay for 2 nights in the same room. Faye is so willing to help you with any questions you have even before you make your reservation!!! The room is clean and the place is quiet. Also the aquarium pass-- we are not able to get to everything in the aquarium within 3 hours but Faye was so nice to let us use the tickets for 2 days, so that we had a chance to see how beautiful jellies are (you dont wanna miss it when you are in Monterey!!!)! Definitely going back again to try the breakfast provided by Faye [Too rush for morning time...] "
2118041,29457904,2015-04-07,30178720,Dorothea,Alles super und sauber. Kommunikation lief ohne Probleme. Vielen Dank! 
2118041,29786166,2015-04-12,11549063,Chris,"We had a lovely time staying with Faye. She was an amazing host, very communicative and fast to respond to whatever questions or requests we had. She made breakfast for us and gave us tips on where to park at the aquarium, as well as other things to do in the area.

Would definitely stay here again. "

2118041,30681646,2015-04-26,6397408,Jessica,We arrived when Faye wasn't home but another house guest let us in.  Faye arrived shortly and welcomed us into her lovely home.  The room was spacious and neat and there was plenty of storage space and extra pillow and blankets in the closet.  The blinds are a little hard to use so you might want to ask Faye for help before you go to sleep so that the sun doesn't wake you up too early in the morning.  The aquarium passes were extremely easy to use and we had a wonderful time.  Faye provided us with an amazing breakfast the next day and sent us off with some advice on some coastal views to hit before heading further south to Big Sur.  Faye was a generous host and we will definitely be calling on her if we get to come back to the area soon.
2118041,31071521,2015-05-01,31613251,Toon And Hera,"Faye made eggs and Chinese tea in the morning and helped us with our luggage. Parking is on the opposite side of the street.
The house is not a long drive from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row which is very convenient.
Just keep in mind that the bath (with jets) does not work and that it is cold. There is a small electric heater to share with the other guests."
2118041,31140268,2015-05-02,2076741,James,"We had a great stay! Faye was a wonderful host and knew Monterey really well. The place felt homely and safe, there was plenty of parking space, and breakfast was delicious."
2118041,32926247,2015-05-23,18007713,Jonathan,"We stayed at Faye's place in beautiful Pacific Grove for one night. The room is clean and the place is quiet. We had a wonderful experience! Faye is such a gracious host, answered all of our questions patiently and made sure we felt at home. She provided passes to the aquarium that had excellent exhibits, including the jellyfish (amazing!!). Faye also provided a hearty breakfast in the morning that enabled us to quickly get on the road for hours without stopping. I highly recommend staying here if you are in the area, it is very conveniently located to Monterrey/Carmel/17 Mile Drive.
"
2118041,32983738,2015-05-24,11887362,Afaan,"Our experience was fine.  Could partially be due to the long Memorial Day weekend, but we did feel like we overpaid for a place that was a little drab. The location certainly didn't justify the rate either. Not in Carmel or Monterey. The place was definitely clean, and Faye was friendly and hospitable. "
2118041,33141963,2015-05-25,22526365,Joan,"Faye and Bill were very nice. 

The place was noisy during the night and the room was quite humble. Definitely the pictures look way nicer than what I saw by myself

Other guests that were staying were very noisy and we had a hard time falling sleep. I was not able to fall sleep until 1am. We left the house by 9am in the morning. I would probably not recommend this place despite Faye and Bill were nice. Sorry. "
2118041,33267147,2015-05-26,21895464,Zhuojiong,"Faye is very nice, and her house is pretty. It is a good place to stay, especially for Chinese."
2118041,33759493,2015-05-31,34369496,Malo,Great stay. Thanks. Breakfast good.
2118041,34319777,2015-06-07,30241264,Elisa,Great place and Faye was a great host. Loved the passes to the aquairaum! Very flexible on arrival and departure time which helped our trip.
2118041,34680350,2015-06-10,35113683,Geoffrey,She recommends some good places that we can visit around Monterey. We even get some discount tickets of Monterey Bay Aquarium that we enjoy a good half day in there. The breakfast she offers is also good. The place is super quite as well. She is nice.
2118041,35017036,2015-06-14,12306075,Elissa,"Faye was very kind and accommodating. She keeps a clean home. 
That said, it is drab and musty and the pictures are slightly misleading. The room was small for 2 people and $381 for 2 nights was HUGELY over priced. I was also woken up at 4 am on Sunday by a loud alarm clock that persisted off and on for 45 minutes. Then someone got up and stomped around, banging around the bathroom until 5:30 am. I wouldn't stay here again, even though I appreciated Faye's hospitality."
2118041,36335198,2015-06-27,23468253,Joseph,"非常nice的房东,还借给了我们水族馆的卡,非常开心"
2118041,36468832,2015-06-28,31939508,Brenda,"Faye was very prompt in answering questions. 

Faye's home was a very humble cute house. It did look much more nicer in pictures though.

Upon arrival, Faye showed us our room, gave us our key and aquarium passes. 

The room was decent and we liked the big closet mirrors. The floor was somewhat creaky and you could literally hear everything that was going on in other rooms. 

The parking lot is across the street and it is somewhat scary at night but its a very quiet street. Safeway is 24/7 and Carls Jr is open until late, which is very helpful when looking for a late night dinner. 

Faye was very kind and offered breakfast but we unfortunately couldn't stay and had to leave early the next day.  Very reserved host and a bit overpriced."

2118041,36779325,2015-07-01,30898539,Jie,"这是我们这次旅行最糟糕的入住体验,房间极其狭小,我们三人挤在一间不足15平的房间内,房东给加的床为一张折叠床,中央凹陷,非常不舒服,枕头有异味,共用的卫生间夜间上锁,早上不得不绕到客厅卫生间方便,简单的早餐只有两个鸡蛋和两片面包,总之是性价比极其差的入住体验,房东给的门牌号码输入GPS根本无法找到,房间真实情况与照片严重不符(房间内有超级大的衣橱镜所以照片显得大),除了地点离17英里比较近,其他没有值得推荐的地方,奉劝国内的朋友选择这家入住三思。"
2118041,37539717,2015-07-07,36916139,Celine,"这是我第一次选择airbnb, 感谢Feya的热情招待!带我们换了另一个房子,很好的体验!"
2118041,37631209,2015-07-08,34472449,Ling,"房东王姐给人的感觉很是亲切,给我们的房间也布置得很温馨舒适;最为感谢的是她还把厨房借给我们做中式饭菜。她的先生很幽默健谈,和我们聊了不少他们家族有意思的往事,遗憾的是,我们的英文还不够好,只听懂了一半。这家民宿值得推荐!会给来美国旅行的中国人家的感觉!"
2118041,37825107,2015-07-10,34649542,Chisem,"Great location, clean room and nice hosts. Enjoyed our stay very much"
2118041,38023033,2015-07-12,5347089,Katherine,"Faye was welcoming to us and we felt very comfortable in her home. It was clean and quiet. We really enjoyed the aquarium passes and meeting others at breakfast in the mornings. Faye's home is very central, so it was easy to get around in Pacific Grove and to go to Monterey. Parking was not a problem as there was always space for our car in front of the house. My husband and I would definitely want to stay at Faye's next time we visit Pacific Grove."
2118041,38306643,2015-07-14,33805434,Hugh,"This place is awesome! 
Close to Fisherman's Wharf and many other place to visit. Room was clean and nice, restroom was nice as well. Faye offered breakfast as well so that was really nice. I also really liked the aquarium. Overall it was fantastic! I would definitely stay here if I come to this area again. "
2118041,38614586,2015-07-17,7450746,Robert,Faye and her husband were both very friendly and welcomed us into their home.  The proximity to the Monterey Bay Aquarium w/ the free tickets is what makes this particular AirBnb worth the stay.  The listing was accurate but keep in mind that this is basically a boarding house.  The downstairs bath is shared between 3 guest bedrooms.  Depending on the number of guests staying in each bedroom you might have to wait for access to the bath.  Breakfast was 2 scrambled eggs and 1 bagel w/ cream cheese each morning.  We were not asked if we had any preferences for breakfast.  The neighborhood is residential.
2118041,39665703,2015-07-25,35913918,Yuhua,"Faye is very nice, and her house is very clean."
2118041,40493680,2015-07-31,34069614,Xiao,The room is really comfortable and warm. It's just like living in our own home. The host is also hosting. I'm looking forward to next trip. 
2118041,40687259,2015-08-01,25435299,Jacky,"Faye's husband was home alone to greet us when we arrived. He was very polite and was an overall gentleman; he gave us the Wifi information right away (Maybe because we looked young) and it was much appreciated. He then left us to our booked room and let us rest and shower. The place was tidy and clean, so it was accurate to its description. We finally met with Faye after our dinner in the Monterey Old Fisherman Wharf district. During our chit chat, we learned that there was a slight communication issue with the 2 free aquarium tickets stated in her listing. We were traveling from Southern California and by the time we arrived at her house, it was almost 6pm. So I figured that we can use the 2 free pass the next day, as that was our original plan anyways. But as it turns out, the free pass was only good for the night we are staying at, which meant if we were to actually go the aquarium that day, we would've had to arrive way before 6pm (Aquarium closes at 6pm). It was partially my fault for not confirming the date, but as a quest, I would assume the host would let us know about these details. I even commented that I will be arriving around 5-5:30pm, at which point I would think she would tell us that the aquarium tickets are good only for that day, as she even requested for my and my SO's full names in order to attain the aquarium. But because her husband was the only person home when we arrived, I don't see how she can hand us the tickets anyways. I'm guessing she was home during much of the day but stepped out while we reached her home. So in the end, we were not able to use the 2 free tickets. Faye served us a simple, but filling breakfast the next day consisting of eggs and sesame seed bagels with spread. We ate with a family of four traveling from Washington D.C. and had a wonderful conversation with them. The home was inviting and the bathroom was clean even with multiple guests staying that night. Other than the communication we had, everything else is highly recommended. I would just advice anyone staying here hoping to use the 2 free tickets to contact Faye about it as soon as you can so you can plan your time accordingly. "
2118041,40804808,2015-08-02,1316216,Rei,"Very friendly host at a lovely house!

She accommodated our early arrival, and also gave us an aquarium pass that she had to scramble to get a replacement for, since the previous guests tossed the pass.

I'm glad I stayed with her. I hope to come back again!
"
2118041,41499688,2015-08-07,28519672,John,"Excellent house and location!  Very close to 17 mile drive and beaches, and very easy to get to downtown Monterey and Carmel. Faye is wonderful and keeps a very clean house.  I had such a great time that I'm looking forward to staying there again."
2118041,41806617,2015-08-09,38133827,Yiran,"The house is clear and tidy. The bathroom is big and the shower is pretty good. I would rate 5 stars for the location. It is close to the aquarium and a range of restaurants. Faye cooked breakfast for us. It is always  nice to start a day with some hot brekkie. The free aquarium pass was great, we got there around 9.30am and avoided the big queue and went straight through the member's entrance. 
The only downside is that the wall is quite thin. We het are neighbours giggling And chatting at night.

Overall, I would recommend this place especially if the aquarium is on your list."
2118041,42657349,2015-08-15,30283021,Mark,"Faye and her husband were polite hosts.  We would describe the experience as more like boarding house . If the house is full then expect to wait to use use the one communal bathroom. The aquarium passes were a real bonus. Breakfast was OK and you,can request cereal . We were on a trek through California and would have found local info such as maps, recommendations to eat, bars etc helpful. Had to ask for WiFi password and think an info sheet with everything on for tired and weary travellers would be helpful. Faye knew we were coming from Yosemite after a long drive yet we were not offered water or any other drinks which was disappointing considering how much money we had paid. Overall good location, clean accommodation , pleasant house , bathroom facilities not ideal, polite host but overpriced for what you actually receive "
2118041,43055848,2015-08-17,35924436,Dongxia,"房东非常好!两天早上都给我们做了粥,吃了20天汉堡后吃到地道的中国的味道可以想象是多么的美好……她家位置也很好,离17mile很近……小镇很小,离水族馆也不远……房间漂亮干净……推荐入住……"
2118041,43242337,2015-08-18,33499493,Bridge,"我们在Faye的家停留了一天,非常愉快的经历!房子整洁而温馨,对面的小操场上竟然有鹿。和我们一起住进来的还有另外一个中国家庭,Faye非常体贴的为我们做了粥当早餐。非常感谢Faye:)希望下次有机会继续住在这里。"
2118041,44651541,2015-08-28,22545317,Steven,The house was accessible and clean and was an excellent place to stay for the local workshop I was doing.
2118041,44775250,2015-08-29,19864739,Camille,"Faye house was close to the aquarium and to the touristic center which was convenient. 

We only stayed one night, it was good, we slept well. You can hear the people on the next room but lucky for us, they were quiet. 

"
2118041,44947326,2015-08-30,5320857,Michelle,"Faye was a great host right from the start! She accepted quickly, and was very responsive in the time leading up to our stay. She accommodated our early check-in needs, and our room was clean and spacious. She also made us coffee in the morning and gave us water for our trip down to Big Sur the day we checked out.

The location of the place was great! Very close to the museum, and the aquarium passes were an amazing bonus.

Very happy to have stayed with Faye! "
2118041,46006725,2015-09-07,41301536,Elliot,"The experience is completely painless... I moved into the place for 4 nights.  When I needed a 3-legged charger for my computer, Faye got me immediately. She is really friendly."
2118041,47137898,2015-09-15,928344,Raffi,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2118041,47503340,2015-09-19,42128279,Poh Leng,"We stayed at the place for 2 nights. The room was too small for 3. The third person was required to sleep on a foldable bed which was uncomfortable. We were disappointed with the toilet cleanlines & think it could be better. 
Faye was accommodative to our request; making porridge & fried eggs when she knew we missed Chinese breakfast. The house is located 5 min drive to Monterey aquarium. "
2118041,48197356,2015-09-24,1731938,Ping,"The location is very close to the 17-mile drive. The house is clean and we were impressed by the breakfast that Faye made for us! There was some miscommunication between Faye and I so we were not able to take advantage of free aquarium tickets - it was not clear that we were supposed to use the tickets on the same day of our stay. But overall, we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone. "
2118041,49376527,2015-10-03,18015777,Duke,Checking was very easy. Great communication. Home was clean and so was the room. I would stay there again.
2118041,49456733,2015-10-04,20033258,Rochelle,"My boyfriend and I traveled to Monterey for the weekend and booked a room in Faye's home. She was very accommodating throughout the entire process! She even let us check-in and pick up the aquarium tickets early. Unfortunately, something came up and we weren't able to stay the night; but overall, we had a short, but pleasant stay at Faye's. "
2118041,66790690,2016-03-24,54374823,James,Faye is extremely friendly and welcoming. She was very accommodating and always provided quick solutions if anything came up. 
2118041,67958484,2016-04-01,59599435,Lindsey,"Faye was accommodating about our arrival time and the room was exactly as pictured.  Faye's home was clean and she made us breakfast every day.  We also loved the free pass to the aquarium, which we spent about four hours in!  "
2118041,69476690,2016-04-11,38300312,Denisa,"Faye was a great host, I really liked her and she was always quick to respond. We were excited to stay here as we had booked an entire house very close by for our family and this was going to be our sleeping room for the 2 of us. On the rules it says ""take your shoes off"" Being a clean freak that was a selling point for me because I'm assuming the house was clean and I was wrong. The room was not clean, there was cobwebs right behind the dresser. The furniture was old. My boyfriend killed 2 spiders in our 5 day stay. Bathrooms is outdated and dirty. Thank God we had another house very close by so we basically just went in to sleep and out early in the morning. I would not stay here again, I did not feel comfortable as it was not to my standards. Also, it says that the parking lot holds dozens of cars but we were told to park on the side of the road in front of the house and since we had a van it didn't really fit in there very well. I hope that Faye does something to keep the rooms extra clean as she seems like a very lovely lady. "
2118041,72448792,2016-05-02,58946472,Ronald,"fantastic staying experience with Faye. Host would talk with all the guests together, make friends among all the guests and connect all the guests together. What a really impressive stay there."
2118041,73270071,2016-05-07,9236041,Ana-Sofia,"Faye's house is very welcoming and we had a lovely stay. We were given clear instructions with a lot of leeway for arriving when it suited us day-of. She offers a complete breakfast each morning which helps to start the day more quickly so you can get off to enjoying the beauty of the area. Location is terrific. An easy drive to Carmel, Monterey (and the aquarium) and a beautiful walk to Spanish Bay. Faye is delightful and accommodating. She even played with our baby while we packed the car.  "
2118041,75208355,2016-05-19,40790847,Pam,"We booked our stay in Faye's home for its convenient location, but soon realized that the hidden gem is Faye herself. She is a very warm, friendly, kind and funny person, and by the time we checked out we had a new friend.

Faye's home is in a very convenient location in Pacific Grove, just outside the PG gate into 17 Mile Drive and just above the Inn at Spanish Bay. The dresser drawers in our room contained maps and brochures about the area, and she shares her aquarium membership passes with guests. We had a cooked breakfast every day, and if you are a coffee lover you will appreciate Faye's special brew. 

She is a tiny little Chinese lady who is working very hard every day to improve her English. We had an especially fun evening around the kitchen table with Faye, her tenant Andy and a bottle of Irish cream, with us teaching her English and Faye teaching us Chinese. We laughed so much during our stay with her, and we were truly sad when it was time to say goodbye.

We wholeheartedly recommend booking your stay with Faye. Do take the time to get to know her, and you will leave Pacific Grove with a charming new friend in your heart.
"
2118041,75508002,2016-05-21,4499474,Kimberly,"The location was great! We were very central to the aquarium, 17-mile drive, and fisherman's wharf. Our hostess was also very sweet, and welcomed us into her home earlier than I'd initially said I would show up. Although she didn't immediately orient us to her house/area, there were restaurants posted on her fridge with suggestions, and she was very responsive to questions.

As far as the amenities themselves, the bed was comfortable, and the closet very spacious, although the room was a little chilly at night; possibly a space heater would have been useful, or better insulation on the windows. Shared bathroom (with 2 other AirBNB guests) was sparkly clean! I didn't get a chance to try the hot tub, but the shower water was hot. It might have been nice to include soap in the shower; we brought our own, though.

Overall, a good low-key place to stay, although not the lap of luxury."
2118041,75868707,2016-05-23,6774823,Kenna,"Everything was wonderful about our stay! Faye was very friendly, made us breakfast, and the free aquarium passes were much appreciated. The room was very comfortable and we had a great time all around!"
2118041,77261886,2016-05-31,68259848,Christy,"My husband and I stayed here over Memorial Day Weekend to celebrate our 1st anniversary. We had an incredible time!

Faye was a fantastic hostess and was very accommodating! We were late for check in because the normal 3 hour drive actually took 6 hours but Faye was really flexible and didn't seem upset about it at all. 

The rooms looked just like the pictures. They were clean and I liked that our shared bathroom was right across the hallway. There were also other air bnbers staying there as well.

The location is ideal. It's just a 10 minute drive to the Monterrey Bay Aquarium and a 20 minute walk (5 min drive?) to the Spanish Bay Inn. We walked over to the Inn right when we arrived and there's a beautiful golf course and a great beach to walk along.

In the morning Faye made us a light breakfast: eggs and a bagel with coffee before heading over to the aquarium.

We will definitely be staying here again when we're in the area."
2118041,82017784,2016-06-26,2147485,Vera,"Increíble , como si estuvieras en casa . Genial !!! Great! Like at home!"
2118041,84065823,2016-07-05,44206023,Neha,Faye was an amazing host to stay with. Loved that she made breakfast which allowed us to meet other airbnbers visiting the area. I would highly recommend her place and its in a fantastic location. 
2118041,87660792,2016-07-21,2672680,Eduardo,We pass a wonderfull time at Faye hone.  And she is amazing.  Thanks for all.
2118041,92357876,2016-08-08,14804454,Frank,"Renter Beware!!  We were very unhappy with our stay here. There was a horrible moldy smell in our room. We couldn't use the drawers because of how musty there were. It would have ruined our cloths! We also were unhappy with how noisy the house was. She rented out 2 other rooms plus her stepson and husband live int house as well. At one time there were 10 people living in the house! The stepson played techno music at all times of the day and night. He woke us up many times. He would come home at 2am and bang around. He also took very long showers and sometimes we didn't have hot water when we wanted to shower. Her husband would blast the TV all day long. So we couldn't really hang out in the house anywhere. The kitchen was also crowded a lot of the time and we couldn't cook any meals. The fridge was to full and we couldn't find our stuff. Faye also had a dinner party with her friends one night until midnight. We had to go tell them that we are trying to sleep. The biggest problem here is that they act as if no one else is in the house. They go about their business like no one is there and you end up feeling like a big imposition. There is no regard for your needs or your well being.  We had a very unpleasant and miserable time there. We tried to find another place but nothing was available. So what we did was we tried to stay away from the house as much as possible. We would would leave early in the morning and come back late at night just to sleep. Which was also very unpleasant because of the smell and noise.  We ended up having to go out to eat more than we wanted to because we didn't want to cook in that kitchen. Some people just shouldn't run a service orientated business like a bed and breakfast. Unfortunately, Faye is one of them. "
2118041,93461987,2016-08-12,5555040,Heather,"Faye was a wonderfully sweet host and our stay couldn't have been better. The room was very comfortable with one of the coziest beds I've ever encountered in my travels. The bathroom was large and everything impeccably clean. Cannery Row is a 5 minute drive down the (Website hidden by Airbnb) convenient! It was also an awesome perk to be able to use the aquarium passes, which saved us a ton of money. Thank you Faye for your excellent hospitality! :)"
2118041,99377504,2016-09-04,76331752,Linda,"Faye was an excellent manager and very responsive before the trip, during the stay, and following our stay. I would recommend the location is great between Monterey and Carmel.

The communication with Faye and her family was pleasant and they gave us some good advices for our stay. The freshly prepared breakfast and the tickets for the aquarium were a great extra. We can absolutely recommend this accommodation. Thanks a lot for everything, Faye :) we had a great stay! "
2118041,101049415,2016-09-11,24405831,Matteo,"We stayed for two days at Faye's place. She has been very gentle and kind with us. In particular we appreciated the breakfast and the passes for the aquarium. 

The house is very close to the 17-mile drive, so it is a strategic position for tourists with a car."
2118041,102249653,2016-09-17,76577982,Lisa,"So I'm writing on behalf of myself and my female cousin (so 2 women). The location was great, close to beach and the city.  It was nice to have tickets to the aquarium.  I think this would be a great place for college students or someone who literally want to crash for a night
and not care about amenities or comfort (which i know is all relative) .  The host was nice, but not to sound mean, I couldn't understand her very well bc her English was not clear, very broken english, she said she would make breakfast for us  but neither days we stayed did we get breakfast.  She did make some coffee.  Over all it was an okay experience, this was my very first air bnb and it wasn't what I expected.  The room was clean, bathroom is across the hall which was shared with another man staying in the next room, who left the toilet seat up lol which was annoying, the shower door didn't close properly.   she did provide towels.  So basically,  if your just a passerby and don't really care about the things i stated then its a great place, if you want to stay at somewhere you may pay a little more but get a better overall experience and privacy, then i would keep looking, With all this being said this is MY experience and my perception and everyones view of what is acceptable and nice is all relative.  The star rating would be 2 out of 5.  "

2118041,124397407,2017-01-01,8478725,Debrup,Faye is a great host. She went out of the way to make us comfortable. 
2118041,126809305,2017-01-14,12338054,Nicole,"Loved the location of this airbnb. It was close to both downtown Monterrey and Carmel-by-the-Sea. It was easy to get to both by driving or taking cheap Uber. 

Faye was able to give us guest passes to the aquarium and we had a great time there! It was nice to be able to save so much money on admission. 

Parking was a small issue because we weren't too sure where we were allowed to park but found street parking easy enough. 

I would definitely recommend this place to stay! "
2118041,131758806,2017-02-13,107400516,Ed,Parking is limited. Parking on a dark street around the corner in the rain is a challenge. Walking at night on a very dark street could be a problem. The shower door is broken and held together with tape which obviously does not work. A new door is relatively a quick and cheap fix.Faye is a pleasant & friendly hostess.

Even though you can hear things from outside the room it was a good stay overall. She gave us the aquarium passes to visit Monterey bay aquarium which we enjoyed a lot.

2118041,148848119,2017-05-01,49565728,Rodrigo,Nice stay. Thanks Faye
2118041,154279412,2017-05-23,35082592,Kim,If you are looking for a bed and a bath this is your place. Faye is lovely and attentive.
2118041,154704948,2017-05-25,6862234,Gregg,Nice location. Very good breakfast! Nice host.
2118041,156510706,2017-05-30,113610426,Daniel,Very great hosts. Very close to the Monterey bay aquarium. Very clean rooms and Faye made us breakfast everyday! Can't recommend enough. 
2118041,159371507,2017-06-10,132650763,Jon,A nice quiet out of the way place in lovely Pacific Grove. Very clean and the hostess is very responsive. Close to Asilomar and other scenic spots. 
2118041,160379260,2017-06-13,56773324,'Martina,Thank you for a great stay and yummy breakfast. I appreciate the aquarium passes as it is a great value! Let's us use the kitchen and fridge to store leftovers! Great value and convenient to Monterey! 
2118041,161065960,2017-06-16,66121154,Sally,Faye's place is in a great location...right by 17 mile drive! The room is as she describes it. Bed is very comfortable and Faye is very nice. The bathroom was a shared space between other people staying at the house which I did not realize but it was kept clean. The breakfast was good!
2118041,162419126,2017-06-20,95779806,Andy,"Faye's place offered a comfortable stay and she was very accommodating as a host. She offered two guest passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which saved us $100 in value and made sure to arrange breakfast for us. Even with multiple guests in the house, we felt as if we had our own privacy. The neighborhood is nice, quiet, and just a few minutes drive from stores/restaurants/aquarium. Pebble Beach and the Big Sur scenic drives are easily accessible from Faye's place. She did a fantastic job making us feel right at home. "
2118041,163957657,2017-06-25,69203311,Brianna,"Faye's place was perfect for my trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium! It was only about a 6 minute drive into town to get there, and she kindly shares her annual passes with guests.  The neighborhood is quiet and calm, with lots of trees and cooked breakfast was simple, convenient, and really tasty! The other guests in the home give the place a pretty classic bed and breakfast feel."
2118041,165701113,2017-07-01,67762563,Patricia,"Although listed in Pacific Grove, I had hoped it would be closer to downtown or the Aquarium. It was not a long drive to those places. Finding a place to park at Faye's can be difficult.
The aquarium passes were a big bonus. Although specified a shared bathroom , I discovered I would have preferred a private bathroom.
Faye was a good host, who made great breakfasts and shared helpful information about local restaurants and sites.
"
2118041,166570205,2017-07-03,45693921,Irene,"Faye was a very nice, social, and caring host. She made breakfast for us and encouraged friendly conversation at the table with the other guests. Be advised that parking is offsite, street-parking. It is very easy to find and only 1 minute walk from Faye's home, but you will not be able to park in front of her house. The room was clean. Bring a sweater as Monterey can get quite chilly."
2118041,168635354,2017-07-09,132501475,Mary Ann,"Very clean home!  Location perfect for our site seeing agenda.  Faye and her husband were very friendly.  Casual level of conversation and in no way intrusive.  If in the area again I would stay again.  Bonus for us was a Starbucks 1/2 mile down the road.  Faye had coffee but we love our 'decked out' Starbucks coffee when on vacation.  Also, other general shopping in that area.  VERY close to 17 mile drive which is a must see!  Easy travel to Monterey and sites there.  "
2118041,170512762,2017-07-15,49371996,Avery,"Faye's hospitality was a warm welcome to CA. Breakfast in the morning was delightful, like a true bed and breakfast. "
2118041,247779543,2018-03-29,151575632,Rachael,Great place to stay with aquarium passes included. Faye was very accommodating and gave us great tips on where to go in Monterey. Very nice experience.

3029273,18404962,2014-08-26,5178614,Rebecca,"Jim and Nina were wonderful hosts. The beach house is clean and nice, with everything we needed for a great anniversary weekend. The house is two blocks from the beach and minutes from a great bike path that goes by the aquarium and then to downtown Monterey. We would definitely stay here again. "
3029273,18548564,2014-08-28,3923927,Dan,"We had such a great stay in Pacific Grove. Jim's description of the apartment and location were spot on.

A wonderful base to explore the Monterey area from, or just walk around Pacific Grove and relax.

We would definitely recommend Jim's apartment to anyone seeking a high quality apartment right near the water."
3029273,19041941,2014-09-05,17008,Rachel,"Jim and Nina's Pacific Grove beach house is an ideal home base for discovering the natural wonders of Monterey, Big Sur and surrounding areas. The cozy space is thoughtfully and beautifully designed, in addition to being spotlessly clean. The neighborhood is quiet and Pacific Grove itself is adorable and authentic, with excellent dining options from affordable to fancy; we actually preferred it to Carmel's upscale scene, although visiting Carmel is a must, and a quick 10 minutes away. But from Jim and Nina's place, you can enjoy a beautiful coastline walk two blocks from home, hiking galore, the 17-mile drive (by bike!), and access to some of the most amazing marine wildlife in the world. We very much appreciated the two guest passes to the famous, conservation-minded Monterey Aquarium; what a joy it was to then stop on a beach a few miles south of Carmel only to see whales swimming just off the coastline! On the home front, Jim was extremely responsive to a few questions we had upon arrival. It was clear they put a lot of thought into their guests' experience. 5 stars!"
3029273,19699463,2014-09-16,1182198,Ryan,"Jim and Nina's bungalow was perfect for our weekend at the beach. The location was perfect for walks to the water and short drives to downtown Pacific Grove and the Aquarium. The house itself was beautiful; appointed with high end appliances and clean, beach-y interior design. Parking was a breeze and the neighborhood was peaceful. We've already recommended the place to our parents for a getaway of their own. We'd love to come back."
3029273,20928871,2014-10-07,332218,Banning,"What a tremendous spot to enjoy Pacific Grove and a base to explore Big Sur. The apartment was everything described and more – Jim was kind enough to provide bathroom amenities, guest tickets to the Aquarium, visitor guides to the area, coffee in the fridge. The whole experience was so easy and would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the area."
3029273,22486757,2014-11-08,3393483,Dave,The place was great.  We loved Pacific Grove and the surrounding area.  There was even a washer/ dryer which is a luxury for us New Yorkers!  Aquarium passes were included and the place was clean and comfortable. Also loved the coded lock so arranging pickup wasn't a problem. Thanks!
3029273,22946816,2014-11-18,21492910,Brittany,This place was absolutely perfect for our mini vaca in pac grove. It was walking distance to the water and a very short drive to downtown. The inside of the place is exactly like the picture and it's extremely charming. Having the patio/grill in the back was wonderful as well. We were able to stay in and enjoy ourselves as if it were home. I would definitely stay here again! Plus having the free guest passes to the aquarium was a nice bonus :)
3029273,23363087,2014-11-30,6058571,Trent,"Very comfortable charming and clean place to stay.  I would defiantly stay at the property again. Everything was provided, just a quick stop at the store and bring your bags!  Jim and Nina have it down, highly recommend! "
3029273,24074576,2014-12-19,19732037,John,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was amazing. We took a risk and booked Jim's place for our 25th wedding anniversary. The place is beautiful, really clean and modern, private, and steps from the beach. We got engaged in this area and Jim's place was the perfect home base for our weekend. We couldn't have asked for anything better!"
3029273,24230308,2014-12-23,8926359,Lanye,"it is a wonderful experience for us! Amazing, amazing, amazing!!!!both Jim and Nina's cute bungalow and fantastic view of pacific grove! My family really enjoyed in this and we definitely will come back again( take my dad! After he saw our picture in here, he totally fall in love with here…) thank you Jim and Nina for all the wonderful host, hope we can see you again! And really good location!"
3029273,25108661,2015-01-06,19795415,Erica,"This lovely little guest house was a perfect retreat for our trip down the California coast. Jim was very communicative and the house was immaculately clean. We would definitely return in the future!!

3029273,25888489,2015-01-28,5097907,Duncan,"Lovely, peaceful, well equipped holiday rental. Highly recommend. Keyless entry made checking in quick and easy. The location is perfect for walking to the bay and the coastal trail, also for sightseeing in the area. Very quiet and comfortable, wish we had booked for a longer stay. 

Excellent use of the space. Appreciate the details that make this rental feel more like home: plants, tissues, comfortable bed, space to hang clothing, properly equipped kitchen. The brochures were helpful in planning our days and learning about the area. 

Loved Pacific Grove, a peaceful, clean and beautiful area. Had a brilliant stay and hope to return. Able to see whales, dolphins, sea lions, seals, and visit the monarch butterfly habitat all near by.  

Thank you very much for sharing your lovely home, it was the relaxing peaceful holiday we needed."
3029273,26007025,2015-02-01,16516,Cindy,"Jim's apartment is gorgeous, located a block from the pristine, secluded Pacific Grove coast. We couldn't have asked for a nicer spot for the weekend. All the amenities of home, thoughtfully designed and curated, and minutes away from Carmel and Monterey. Jim was responsive and flexible over email and by phone; a delightful host. Highly recommend for those visiting the area!"

3029273,29192176,2015-04-05,6880595,Brittany,"The apartment was amazing.   It is clean and cozy, and the hosts even paid attention to stocking small things like Q-tips, shampoo, etc.  We definitely appreciated these small touches that made it seem like we were at home.  They also provide guest passes to the aquarium, which is amazing.  It is located in a cute neighborhood right by the water, and only a short walk/drive to the downtown area.  Jim checked in with us a couple of times while we were there, just to make sure everything was ok.  We would definitely stay here again, and would recommend this apartment to anyone.  In addition, Pacific Grove is a great place to stay, and is very close to Monterey and Big Sur.  "
3029273,30668560,2015-04-26,27202931,Michael,"Jim's place is very tastefully decorated, clean, and spacious for 2 people. Jim was responsive and welcoming; we requested a late check out and he was accomodating. The neighborhood is quiet and close to the ocean. We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. Highly recommend staying here!"
3029273,30918307,2015-04-29,17917245,Martin,"Jim und Ninas Beach House liegt im Herzen von Pacific Grove in einer wunderschönen Nachbarschaft nur wenige Schritte vom Meer entfernt. Die Lage des Appartments lädt vor allem zu ausgedehnten Spaziergängen an der schönen Promenade am Meer entlang ein. Mit dem Auto ist das Monterey Aquarium, die Lighthouse Ave und ein Trader Joes (Supermarkt) innerhalb von 5-10 Minuten zu erreichen. Innerhalb einer halben Stunde ist die Lighthouse Ave mit vielen schönen Cafes und Restaurants aber auch zu Fuß zu erreichen.

Das Beach House ist ein sbsolut wunderbarer Ort, um einfach mal die Seele baumeln zu lassen und sich rundum wohl zu fühlen: Sauber, hübsch einegrichtet und super ausgestattet! 

Das Bett ist sehr bequem, die Schränke im Schlafzimmer laden zum Auspacken der Koffer ein. Auch die Küche bietet alles, was man braucht: Nicht nur mit verschiedenen Kochutensilien haben Jim und Nina das Beach House ausgestattet, sondern auch gleich noch eine Spülmaschine und Kaffeemaschine nebst Kaffeebohnen und Filtern bereit gestellt. Selbst Waschmaschine und Trockner stehen mitsamt Waschmittel zur Verfügung. In einer Ecke im Garten lädt eine kleine Sitzecke zum Genießen ein. Das Bad hat eine schöne Dusche und auch hier ist mit Föhn, verschiedenen Handtüchern, einem kleinen Nachtlicht, das den Weg weist, und verschiedenen Pflegeprodukten an alles gedacht. Die kostenlosen Aquarium-Eintrittskarten runden das Gesamtpaket ab (Regulärer Eintrittspreis wäre über 30,- Euro pro Nase). 

Bei all diesen kleinen Details hat man wirklich das Gefühl, dass sich Jim und Nina viele Gedanken gemacht haben, bei der Einrichtung selbst an die kleinsten Details zum Wohlfühlen gedacht haben und insgesamt viel Liebe und Leidenschaft in das Beach House investiert haben. Eine absolute Weiterempfehlung für alle, die ein schönes Plätzchen für ein bisschen Ruhe und Entspannung in Pacific Grove/Monterey suchen! Wir würden definitiv wieder kommen!"

3029273,31944271,2015-05-12,28577178,Sarah,"'Immaculate' would be the first word I think of when describing this adorable place. Everything was perfectly clean and brand new. We really enjoyed our time here and felt completely comfortable. 
The neighborhood is really quiet and safe, with just a short walk to the beautiful beach. 
So much to do in the area...Monterey and Carmel. We loved our stay and hope to return someday!! Thank you to the hosts for opening up your home to us! "

3029273,32690979,2015-05-20,13010247,Joe,This little beach cottage style back house was perfect for my husband and I for a weekend getaway. We spent most of our time in Carmel and it was a quick drive to get there. Everything was well stocked and so clean. We lived the sheets on the bed so much that we bought them for our house! Perfect for two! Definitely would visit again!
3029273,32963762,2015-05-24,13192544,Rebecca,"The bungalow is reached through a beautifully landscaped side gate. The kitchen and appliances are modern and new. There is ample closet space to hang and store luggage. The host is accessible, flexible and accommodating. "
3029273,33768556,2015-06-01,25463135,Tine,"We spent one week at Jim & Nina's bungalow. The apartment was very clean, the kitchen was well equipped (even fresh coffee beans in the fridge).

We highly recommend this place!

It's a close enough walk to the sea that your coffee doesn't get cold on your morning's journey.  The rooms are spacious and impeccably clean.  The kitchen is fully appointed.  The gardens are a delight.  We very much appreciated the off street parking and loved going to the Aquarium and taking care of the free passes.  We can highly recommend this venue."

The plants on the the patio create a wonderful outdoor oasis. I hope we have the opportunity to stay again. "
3029273,43398680,2015-08-19,38946645,Adam,Such a pleasant stay with Pacific Cove. The property was well situated and adequate for two people. The two aquarium tickets were a great added extra which we really enjoyed.

Door is an electronic keypad so no key was required which I like.  The place was exactly like the pictures.  Beautiful.  And if you want to cook while you're there, the kitchen is amazing!  (If you do cook make sure you turn on the fan because my boyfriend set off the smoke detector twice cooking eggs..lol)  The location was great.  You are only a couple of minutes walk from the ocean and within a short drive to tons of restaurants and Cannery Row.  It was a great place to spend my 40th birthday and I'd definitely return."

All communication and check-in/check-out was so easy (loved the keypad door lock as we didn't have to worry about keys!)  The bungalow was immaculate and so well decorated - very comfortable, clean and exactly as shown.  Pacific Grove was a great home-base for us as we explored the Monterey and Carmel areas.  We had a lovely morning beach-walk, enjoyed a delicious meal at Passionfish and took advantage of the aquarium passes provided by Jim!  Would highly recommend and hope to return someday! "

It has everything you need and was spotless upon arrival. We were able to have a lovely chat with Nina, and she provided us with some great recommendations for restaurants and places to visit.

3029273,50164076,2015-10-10,36529223,Sandra,"This listing is 100% as described. The location is fabulous--we walked the shore road to get dinner our first night. The bed is comfortable; the wifi works well; and the kitchen is well-equipped. There are little note on things like the coffee maker and skylight control to help you use them correctly. We loved the Monterey Aquarium and appreciated that passes were included with our stay. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we are very pleased."

3029273,56778628,2015-12-18,46175647,Aram,"We absolutely loved staying at this beach bungalow! I don't think we will go back to staying in hotels. Seriously. It had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable, pleasant, and fun. It had a full kitchen, including laundry, as well as a private bedroom, and a TV in the living room. We felt that we were in our own little house for the week, and we saved a lot of money since we cooked breakfast at home, and had a fridge to store leftovers. Everything was clean, as well as very nicely designed and furnished. It felt totally like a modern, but cozy Beach bungalow at the same time. We loved that we were walking distance to the walking and bike trails near the coastline, and we took full advantage of that. The bungalow is located in a nice neighborhood, and  we felt safe the entire duration of our stay. We also took advantage of the aquarium passes that were provided which made our stay that much more enjoyable, and loved that we were a couple blocks away from the 17 mile drive which we also took advantage of. We would definitely come back and stay in the same place if we visit Pacific Grove again, and we really enjoyed our honeymoon this entire week!!!"
3029273,56930498,2015-12-20,3799175,James,"We arrived at winter solstice and what a warm home to visit. Not only was the heating welcome to us on a cold, rainy wintery night, but also the space was so inviting and welcoming that we had trouble breaking away to meander the coastal paths. We spent nearly an entire day inside, with the minor excursion to the waterfront to catch waves crashing upon the jagged coastline. But the next morning we meandered further from what we wished was our pied-à-terre down the coastal path for a seven-mile run. What better way to spend an anniversary weekend? Can't think of it. We've been to numerous AirBnB offerings and this is is one that I would considering returning to and would recommend to family and close friends. "
3029273,57220821,2015-12-23,85728,Satva,"What a great experience staying at this place. The location is perfect, right around the corner from the ocean, modern appliances, super comfy bed, and great communication from the host. I highly recommend staying here!"
3029273,57421336,2015-12-26,38269207,Andrea,We loved the beach house. Very well equipped and cosy in a peaceful location in a very beautiful part of California. There was nothing we could suggest for improvement it was perfect 
3029273,58536168,2016-01-03,15334987,Scott,"Great place to stay, cozy atmosphere. Close to many things in the Monterey and Pacific Grove areas. The beach house is well maintained and all appliances are up to date and operational. Located in a nice neighborhood and not far from a walking park. The aquarium passes were an added bonus. My wife and I would highly recommend staying here!"
3029273,59206616,2016-01-08,29953350,Kelsey,"The Beach House was nice and spacious. Furnishings and appliances were modern and easy to use. The best thing was the skylight! Monterey is an easily navigable city, and finding/driving to/parking at the Beach House was a breeze. Less than a 10 minute drive to the aquarium or anywhere else in Monterey. "
3029273,60016672,2016-01-18,1962569,Brian,"The place was perfect for an extended weekend getaway. Amazing location, and it was a great place to relax in between all the outdoor activities Pacific Grove & Monterrey have to offer! Highly recommend it!"
3029273,60333489,2016-01-22,1374520,Marian,"This is a perfect example of what AirBnb is all about. The apartment was exactly as described, extremely clean and comfortable! We had an amazing time in Monterey!  Jim was very responsive and we highly recommend him as a host! Thank you for everything;) 
Marian and Lon"
3029273,61556259,2016-02-06,11149906,David,"The place was perfect! Clean, spacious, comfortable, close to restaurants, modern, fast internet, and half a block from the beautiful waterfront. You can even hear the waves from inside the house. A huge selling point that was not in the description is that this place was built as a guest house and doesn't feel like you're in someone's lived in home.  I'd book again in a heartbeat. "
3029273,61866258,2016-02-08,18412279,Rob,"Jim and Nina are attentive hosts who also respect your privacy. Their place was lovely and located in a great neighborhood just a short walk from the water. It was quiet, wonderfully clean, has a really comfy bed, complete modern kitchen, tidy bathroom, and cozy sitting area. The outdoor seating is perfect for having your coffee in the morning sun. We also appreciated the use of their aquarium passes for a nice day trip. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely choose their place for a return visit.
"
3029273,62154610,2016-02-12,12840550,Jana,"During the Pro Am at Pebble Beach my husband and I stayed at this modern quiet apartment in a serene neighborhood just blocks from the beach and an easy walk to town - it has all the amenities of home. A large eat-in kitchen with dishwasher, range oven, microwave, full refrigerator and washer dryer.  A super clean bathroom with a great hair dryer (I wrote down the model because I liked it so much)...Suitable for longer stays the separate bedroom has open closet space with ironing board and iron and French doors that open out onto your private patio where you could find us every evening resting our tired legs from the Pro Am and drinking wine and listening to those waves..."
3029273,70825731,2016-04-21,58734993,Doris,Lovely home! The skylight was beautiful! Fixtures and furnitures were a perfect match to the house. Very clean and organized! It had everything we needed for a mid-week getaway. Walking distance to the beach and to lovers point park. About 8 minutes drive to monterey aquarium and cannery row. Already thinking about booking this again for parent's anniversary!
3029273,71819257,2016-04-28,43302768,Robin G.,"Jim's house is exactly as described. The location is great, and only a few steps to the ocean side. It's neat and tidy, the facility is in very good condition. 
It's a good place to stay in Monterey area, and I'd like to recommend Jim's house for visitors here.
 "
3029273,72888345,2016-05-05,20588811,Toni,"Great location, clean cozy and comfortable apartment, two blocks from the beach in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. Thank you for the aquarium passes - such an awesome treat!"
3029273,73716572,2016-05-09,58639134,Lauren,We have an amazing time during our stay. The house was amazing and the views of the water where spectacular! Jim was great and answered any question we had! We would definitely stay again! 
3029273,75939712,2016-05-23,8953831,Jessie,"Jim's place was just perfect. It's right by the water in a beautiful neighborhood. Jim and Nina greeted us warmly when we arrived and oriented us to the space. The space is clean, beautifully decorated, and feels private, even though it is attached to the main house. The amenities inside seemed very high quality and new, which was a big plus. We really enjoyed sitting in the backyard for breakfast, using the free passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and cooking in the kitchen, which was nicely stocked with most of the tools we needed. I would highly recommend booking with them if you are looking to stay in the area. We'd looked at other places that didn't look nearly as nice but cost just as much or even more. I'm so glad we found this spot for our mini getaway."
3029273,76390516,2016-05-27,46502780,Amy,"We had an awesome visit at Jim's place in Monterey. The aquarium tickets were perfect, my mom and I spent all afternoon there. The location was ideal and we were able to walk to a lot of places. In addition to the comfy bed and couch, we throughly enjoyed the deck and had breakfast and lunch out there everyday. If you are visiting Monterey, this is place to stay! Thanks so much Jim! "
3029273,76632072,2016-05-28,53285285,Erin,Jim's beach house was so perfect for our road trip to the Big Sur. It's in the perfect location with the 17 mile drive being so close. The place was easy to find and entry was simple. Jim was always quick to respond and even let us arrive a little bit early and use the driveway. We arrived on a cloudy day so the aquarium passes were a wonderful addition. The house is very clean and we loved it! Thanks Jim
3029273,77060630,2016-05-30,1718024,Sasha,"I would definitely recommend this place. Jim/Nina deserve their 5 star review. The place is really clean, private, quiet and the bed was comfortable. I was really impressed with their landscaping and all the native California plants in their yard. The beach is a very short walk away.  We used the aquarium passes and walked to the aquarium - the walk there is about 30 minutes and lovely. It was our wedding anniversary and Jim and Nina left us a card, wine and filled their vase with flowers - so nice!!!! 
The only thing I would tell future guests is to bring an eye mask because the carbon monoxide detector in the bedroom in the bedroom emits this stressful white flashing light every few minutes only during nighttime that is almost like a strobe light (no joke)- not like the typical soft green or red light. My husband and I were completely perplexed by it...we have never seen anything like it on a smoke/Co2 detector. But all in all, excellent experience. "
3029273,80121699,2016-06-16,5685523,Cynthia,"Jim greeted us as we pulled up and made us feel right at home.  The Beach House was exactly as pictured.. bright, clean and comfy. Perfectly located with just a short walk to the shoreline and minutes to the aquarium.  We would rent the unit again in a heartbeat! We will be back!"
3029273,82080453,2016-06-26,6306939,Brittany,The place was beautiful and Jim is a great host!! Would absolutely recommend him. 
3029273,82920731,2016-06-30,73667052,Kelli,"Clean, comfortable and quite.  Nice walk to the aquarium, dining and shopping.  Would definitely stay again.  "
3029273,83094789,2016-07-01,26326895,Lindy,We really enjoyed our stay in Jim's guest house! It was beautiful and in an ideal location. We had everything we needed and were pleased with how clean and tidy it was! We would love to stay again the next time we are in the area.
3029273,83978554,2016-07-05,68460733,Britt,"Had the best 4th of July weekend thanks to Jim and his beautiful Modern Beach House! The private condo, just a two block walk from the beach, was inviting and the perfect retreat for a weekend in Monterey. The Aquarium passes were definitely a plus and made for a fun day on Cannery Row! Jim is a gracious host and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. If you're thinking of staying in Monterey, look no further!"
3029273,84313562,2016-07-06,61676372,Rahmon,"We loved staying at Jim's place!  It is a beautiful apartment with a lovely patio out back to enjoy.  It is minutes from Cannery Row and the 17 mile drive.  On our Pacific Coast Highway vacation, this was our favorite place out of all that we stayed at.  Highly recommend!"
3029273,84684689,2016-07-08,64230225,Jason,"Jim and Nina did an amazing job of informing me of everything and also giving very specific instructions upon arrival.  I love the unit, location, and accommodations...I would def stay here should I make another trip to Monterey.  Great place!
"
3029273,85560394,2016-07-12,4339470,Rafael,"WOW is the word that comes to mind regarding Jim's Modern Beach House.  Excellent location, great accommodations and great host...  The house is walking distance to the bay front trail and in a quiet neighborhood.  The added benefit of the Aquarium passes was fantastic.  In my opinion this is one of the best Aquariums in the country with great guides and an unrivaled location.  Looking forward to visit the area again.  Thanks Jim and Nina..."
3029273,86120004,2016-07-15,50088083,Jill,"Jim, reached out to me prior to my arrival with very specific instructions regarding access and location.  The neighborhood is a perfect location for someone who likes to experience an organic neighborhood.  The restaurants are local and offer excellent food and service.  The shops, grocery stores, clothing stores etc. are owned by small business members invested in PG.  This is very cool place to simply let go and breathe!  "
3029273,86797749,2016-07-17,53963983,April,We loved Jim & Nina's cottage. It is in a great location just a couple of streets from the beautiful shoreline. The house itself is very comfortable and has everything you would need for a short or long stay. Also close to great restaurants and shops. We really enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium. Thanks for everything and the use of the passes. 
3029273,87096619,2016-07-18,46019810,Matthew,"The apartment is absolutely adorable, and the entire process was very smooth. For that he gets 5 stars. Two items to note: 1) If you plan on visiting the aquarium on the last day of your visit, make sure you get up early. I was hoping he would be flexible on returning the passes as long as we were ""checked out"" already, but we were given a strict deadline of noon. 2) If you use Airbnb to meet different people, or have any interaction with your host, this probably isn't the place for you, as Jim's place is very much run like a business. Neither of these items are complaints, but I just thought they were worth noting. I would totally recommend staying here. "
3029273,87547583,2016-07-20,42323080,Haley,"Excellent host with a gorgeous home in the perfect location for playing at the beach, renting bikes, and exploring the aquarium. We loved staying here and would highly recommend to anyone else looking to visit Pacific Grove. "
3029273,91387731,2016-08-05,1132882,S,"Jim and Nina's lovely apartment is absolutely perfect. It's well appointed, clean, comfortable, spacious, quiet, and, most delightfully, it's about a 3-5 minute walk to the water. What an ideal place to get away to relax but also to have all the activity of the Cannery Row, Fisherman's Wharf, the wonderful Monterey Bay Aquarium, the shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove. It's most definitely our kind of place. 

Thank you for creating such an inviting space, Jim and Nina.
We'll surely be back (again)!!
"
3029273,92160990,2016-08-07,60065219,Tristan,Very communicative and welcoming. Would Definitely stay here again!
3029273,94649484,2016-08-16,28250272,Kathleen,"This place is a wonderful spot to relax. My only complaint was that we didn't stay longer. The space is on the same property as the main house, but it's completely separated with its own entrance. We really enjoyed being able to see the aquarium, which was the main reason we were in Monterey. Overall, it was a great experience I'd happily repeat. "
3029273,97662436,2016-08-28,75215840,Andrew,"Jim was very responsive. He always answered our calls and responded to our messages. 
The place was very clean, bright and welcoming. 
My wife and I enjoyed the back patio immensely and felt very at home here. Great kitchen to cook in; they provide all essential cookware.
We would definitely go back if we were ever in the area!"
3029273,98235922,2016-08-30,28401216,Max,This place was ideal for our short stay. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the sunshine in the pretty garden. Everything was very easy on arrival. Would recommend.
3029273,99885133,2016-09-06,16421554,Valerie,"Lovely, clean, and comfortable space. Loved the skylight. Aquarium guest passes were a nice added bonus. Great location to take a long walk to Cannery Row or to Asilomar State Beach."
3029273,100143232,2016-09-07,53225017,Kevin,This place was horrible...said no one ever. This was the best place we were blessed to stay at. Steps away from the Pacific Ocean and very close to Cannery Row. The aquarium passes were a bonus and the place was amazing. The keyless entry worked seamlessly and anything we needed was provided just as if it were our home. The property is very beautiful and the only thing we wish was to stay longer. You need to book this place now. 
3029273,101106079,2016-09-11,71029349,Cynthia,"Tucked away neighborhood, but still a stones throw from everything - Monterey, Carmel and Pebble Beach.  So convenient, modern and cozy.  Loved the decor and the succulents peppered throughout the front and patio of the property.  My mom exclaimed she could easily stay for a month!  All the luxuries/essentials, tissues, coffee, ziploc bags, cotton rounds, q-tips, salon quality hair products, umbrella, yoga mat and even a board game.  There was even a fold out, if you choose to sleep separately.  So nice to have the aquarium passes, entry for adults are retailing $50ea!  The automated the skylight and nightlight feature in the bathroom were such a fabulous touch.    Have it bookmarked for any future stay in the area!  Thanks Jim!"
3029273,101378236,2016-09-13,31790709,Anastasia,"This is a gorgeous and clean airbnb listing- and the hosts, Jim and Nina, are a pleasure to reach out to. The space is filled with light and looks newly built. The location is ideal, about 2 minutes from a beautiful beachside walking trail ""Lovers Point"", 7 minutes' drive to the aquarium. The scenic 17 Mile Drive is also minutes away. Very happy to have stayed here."
3029273,101706835,2016-09-14,65093224,Amy,"It was such an amazing place to stay. Very nice and clean, had everything we needed for our stay. Neighborhood was quiet and in such a great location. The keyless entry made it easy to get right in and settle. Enjoyed a nice visit to the aquarium with provided passes and walks around the area. Wish we stayed longer!  Definitely recommended. Thanks Jim & Nina."
3029273,103704886,2016-09-23,56092086,Michele,A very relaxing and lovely stay at this beautiful and quiet retreat.  There were hummingbirds in the garden every morning.  Pacific Grove is a friendly and welcoming community and a great location for seeing the beauty of Monterey and surrounding areas.  We especially enjoyed Point Lobos.  Thanks for providing such extraordinary accommodations!!
3029273,106353951,2016-10-05,45883011,Keiron,"Lovely stay, wish we had stayed longer to appreciate the little touches the beautiful home offered. 
The modern beach apartment offered beautiful views of the pacific that you could lay in bed and hear at night. 
Everything was at hand all amenities, including those you hadn't thought of. 
Although being English we do like a cup of tea and unfortunately forgot the milk. 

Sadly we only stayed overnight, but I would recommend saying here with a good book and finding a spot to just sit and enjoy one the famous valley wines. 

Thank you for a wonderful relaxing stop Jim and Nina. 

"
3029273,107612182,2016-10-11,76009530,Linda,"What a fantastic location.  We were one and a half blocks from the coast.  We walked the path that runs along the coast every night.  This path runs all the way to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and we walked it enjoying the sea otters, harbor seals, sea lions and a variety of sea birds along the way.  An Uber cost us only $8.50 for the return.  We used the aquarium guest passes twice, what a great perk.   If you go to Pacific Grove you simply must go to Pavel's Backerei.  Go early before the line forms - yes, it is that good.   This rental was a fraction of what a hotel would have cost us and a perfect choice for us.   We would recommend this place in a heartbeat!  "
3029273,108139428,2016-10-14,31750865,Buck,Great stay! Perfect location! Thank you all so much.

3029273,108670971,2016-10-16,85550571,Carly,"Great place! Very cute, pictures accurately represent it. Beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Just a couple blocks to the beach. Comfortable bed with really soft sheets. We were able to make good use of the aquarium passes, which was a great perk with staying here! We had great communication with Jim. This was my first experience with airbnb and it exceeded my expectations. Would definitely love to stay here next time we visit Pacific Grove. Thanks again, Jim!"
3029273,109000535,2016-10-18,27469078,Carla,"Loved our stay!  The neighborhood setting is a short walk from the ocean front, which has a great path long it for walks.  The apartment was clean, comfortable, with everything as described.  Perfect for two people and  patio space if you want to meet friends for drinks.  Just be aware this great spot is a private apartment at the back of the house.  The picture of the balcony is part of the main home, not the apartment so there are no ocean views from the space.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
3029273,110109549,2016-10-24,5727777,Keli,"Cute, cozy, and modern. The apartment looks just like it does in the photos. We did not have any interaction with the owner, however he emailed me with clear instructions. There was a keyless entry lock on the door, which made checking in a breeze.
The apartment is beautifully decorated, was super clean, and only a block from the ocean! You can literally see it from the driveway. Jim provides space to park that is off of the street, which is an added bonus.
There were full sized appliances, cooking utensils, glasses, a coffee maker, washer/dryer...everything that you need. The property is beautifully landscaped with flowers and succulents. 
Great location for some relaxing beach time. The Pacific Grove area is minutes from Monterey. There are several cute restaurants nearby as well. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks for having us!"
3029273,110779256,2016-10-28,35790582,Melanie,"This is an amazing find. We stayed at the cottage for 4 nights, and were so sad to leave! It's situated perfectly just one block from the beach, the hosts are very easy to communicate with and friendly, and the place is the perfect size... not to mention super clean! We absolutely loved our stay, and would highly recommend this rental."
3029273,110987878,2016-10-29,22594307,Zeeshan,We had an incredible time staying at Jim's beach hour for the night. Everything was as expected and the space was incredibly private. The proximity to the water was amazing and we really appreciated Jim's flexibility for our check-in and check-out. 
3029273,111775780,2016-11-01,68845172,Nina,Jim was super-responsive and the place was lovely. Aquarium passes were a great bonus!

3029273,112949932,2016-11-09,70784443,Sean,"The bungalow was fabulous!!  Perfect location, clean and comfortable and the Aquarium passes made us feel like VIPs.  We also left an item in the bungalow and Jim and his wife were very accommodating in helping to get it back to us! "

3029273,117076551,2016-12-04,102385645,Isabel,This little gem in Pacific Grove is as beautiful as the photos show. A million times better than staying at a hotel. It was sad having to say good bye as Jim made sure this little place felt like home. 
3029273,120948032,2016-12-12,61702524,Tracie,We had an amazing stay in this adorable private getaway! 
3029273,121152942,2016-12-14,16867969,Audrey,"We had a fun 2 night stay in Monterey, the owners have done  a wonderful job decorating their modern beach house. The space is so comfortable with everything you could need including a secluded little back patio. The decor is just lovely with a modern beach vibe. Everything was spotless and the bathroom was spacious with a great shower. Even though it is attached to the main house it feels amazingly private. The neighborhood is lovely and we really enjoyed the walk along the coastal path to the aquarium where we used the guest passes, just wish we could have stayed longer - thank you!"
3029273,121762456,2016-12-18,99362901,Joshua,Great location!

Clean, compact and cozy place, quiet neighborhood. The hosts gave clear cut instructions & the communication was great too, though we did not have the opportunity to see them personally. "
3029273,123318515,2016-12-28,26690591,Mitch,"This space was conveniently located near Monterey, Pebble Beach and a short drive to Carmel.  The location is very good and the amenities were all we needed.  It is a small cozy space, very clean and up to date.  We would stay here again."
3029273,129237733,2017-01-29,52011883,Chris,"Super clean little place, right by the beach, full fridge, dishwasher, stove...everything we needed was there and will totally be back soon!!!"

3029273,138680402,2017-03-20,40842608,Shane,"Great place to stay and a perfect location for visiting the entire area. About a 10 drive to downtown monterrey, 15 minutes to carmel, and 5 minutes to all the restaurants in Pacific Grove. A block away from the coast and a trail the runs along side of it. Very private and quite area had a great time while I was there.

"
3029273,138981574,2017-03-22,25419181,Jessica,We highly recommend Jim & Ninas!!! Beautiful & so close to the beach! They were so hospitable & surpassed all our expectations!

3029273,141575436,2017-04-03,25356266,Joseph,"Nice and private. I was able to store my bike in the back out of sight. Love the light and airy interior. All in all, a great weekend."
3029273,142347959,2017-04-07,63491239,Brandelle,"A very nice, clean place to stay! Located behind the main property, you have your own entrance and it's completely private. Easily walkable to the coast. It's about a mile from the main part of town and the aquarium. Lovely residential area.

The only thing I might recommend is to have wash cloths, but other than that, everything is there that you need.

Having Netflix on the Smart TV was nice. Everything is so thought-out and check in and out was a breeze. We (husband and I) have stayed at many AirBnBs and this was a nice one. Plus, you can't beat the aquarium guest passes (avoid the line at the aquarium with the guest passes!)"
3029273,146734744,2017-04-23,5508960,Don,"A perfect getaway tucked just a few blocks from the ocean. Very clean, well-appointed and comfortable. Nice back patio as well. Would definitely return. "
3029273,147582282,2017-04-27,72587993,Jack,Great place. Close to all the Pacific Grove and Monterey sites. Don't miss the 17 mile drive through pebble beach and coastal highway. Unit is cute and walking distance to ocean. Two short blocks. 2 minutes. loved it.
3029273,150298342,2017-05-07,40998482,Liz,"The place is great and accurate as described. Clean, comfortable, and quiet. You can even hear the ocean when the window is open. We had a great stay and would come again."
3029273,150891611,2017-05-09,120104703,Emily,"Fantastic beach location for a quiet getaway. Everything was just as stated - very clean and great attention to detail. Easy, secure, private. "
3029273,152319996,2017-05-15,54491165,Peng,Very charming and cozy spot for one to two people. Quiet neighborhood and really close to the ocean. Superb for relaxing and taking walks by the beach. You can even hear the ocean waves at night. Jim and his wife even greeted us upon arrival. A wonderful stay. 
3029273,154252544,2017-05-23,32628903,Nadia,"If you plan to visit the Monterey area and want to stay in a charming, private bungalow but be close to the beach and all the main sites, Jim and Nina's place is where you want to stay! "
3029273,155178135,2017-05-27,56069914,Seth,The beach house was clean and comfortable. Checking in and out was super easy. The owner was very communicative and flexible. My wife and I came here with our 18-month-old. We brought our own Pack 'n Play and there was plenty of room for it. The property is close to the coast and not far from downtown Pacific Grove with several dining options. The included aquarium passes make for a great deal. 
3029273,156094478,2017-05-29,26436412,Sara,"Jim's place was a great spot to stay for a wedding. The location was great, very quiet but within walking distance to shops and restaurants. We took the recreation trail to the aquarium, which was about a 30-35 min walk. 

The apartment was clean and spacious and well appointed with kitchen gear, beach gear, etc. We would definitely stay again! "
3029273,159104376,2017-06-09,131904203,Dimitar,"The beach house was outstanding. Everything was top notch! We wanted to move in for good, that's how great this place was. Would love to come back one day! Thanks again Jim! "
3029273,159338428,2017-06-10,22386538,Andre,We really enjoyed our brief visit. Very clean and tidy. Jim was very responsive and available in his communications. This rental is ideal for beach lovers... less than 2 blocks away from a wonderful scenic view. I highly recommend this location if you need a home base for exploring the bay.
3029273,161033015,2017-06-16,22965447,Molly,"We had a great stay in Pacific Grove! The place was clean, comfortable and an easy walk to the beach. Would definitely recommend!"
3029273,162129796,2017-06-19,34810913,Teri,Jim's place was just perfect.  It was a block from the beach and you could walk along the path to the downtown area very easily- and it is a beautiful walk!  The bungalow was bright and very clean.  It had a lovely garden porch area that was perfect for morning coffee.  We would definitely stay there again.  
3029273,163095564,2017-06-23,75211118,Peter,"This place has a great location, very close to the bay for oceanfront walks. It is cozy, quiet, and comfortable.

Minor complaint: It had not been cleaned when we checked in. Jim remedied this very quickly, but blamed the failure on the cleaning crew, who forgot to show. We were exhausted from a day of traveling and just wanted to nap, but had to go out for another hour or so before we could return to a clean place with a made bed. Ultimately, it is the owner's responsibility to ensure their property is ready at check-in. At this price point, it would've been nice to get a discount for one of the nights or a bottle of wine or something to comp us for the inconvenience (after all, we paid for time in the place that we couldn't use). 

Also, the body wash bottle in the shower was empty and clearly hadn't been checked in a while. If you're going to provide guests with soap/shampoo and other amenities, they need to be kept stocked/usable."
3029273,163952680,2017-06-25,112313252,Carly,Great location and cute place to stay! Hiking at point lobos was perfect. And we really enjoyed the tickets to the acquarium! 
3029273,166096328,2017-07-02,47299506,Genevieve,Jim's place was great. The aquarium passes were a nice bonus. We had a lovely stay.

3029273,168090575,2017-07-08,3355583,Cindy,"My boyfriend and I loved staying at Jim's place! We were thoroughly impressed with the home, the location (short walk to the beach and about 2 miles to the aquarium), and very happy to use the passes provided to see the sea creatures. Would not hesitate to recommend his place to anyone visiting the area. "
3029273,169737430,2017-07-13,27810518,Scott,"Perfect place for our stay in Pacific Grove. Beautiful, clean, and a great location. Use of the aquarium passes was also an added bonus. Would definitely stay here again."
3029273,172084764,2017-07-19,2322404,Kyle,Jim's place is great...exactly as described and shown in the pictures. We'll be back!

3029273,191243444,2017-09-06,41305436,Isaiah,"Jims apartment was a great getaway home! Checkin was the easiest I have experienced in a airbnb and the neighborhood is truly idyllic and relaxing. The neighbors were friendly and spoke highly of Jim and his wife. :) The beach is just a block down the street and great resturants are within a very short drive. The location is amazing with great accomidations! A full kitchen and our own washer and dryer were wonderful. If you are looking for a place in Monterey, look no further!

Jim made us feel at home and provided a fan and updated the curtains for us as the area was having a fluke hot spell during our stay. Thanks so much!"
3029273,195541570,2017-09-19,166929,Josh,"Great place, and great host!  It was comfortable and clean, and all the details we needed to know about the home were provided for us. We got to use the aquarium passes and we were close to a lot of other good places to explore in Monterey."
3029273,196035804,2017-09-21,25224172,Emma,Great location to the surrounding areas of Monterey. Loved that it was soo close to the beach ( great area to see the sun rise).  The aquarium passes were a great treat!  I absolutely recommend this home  if you're looking for a place in Monterey.
3029273,202079470,2017-10-09,144094540,Laura,"This is a lovely, private place to stay. I highly recommend it! We had a great time here."
3029273,205808846,2017-10-22,5173871,Noelle,"This place has absolutely everything you could need. Even though we stayed one night, it would be a great place to stay multiple days. Quiet and cute neighborhood. Jim quickly answered when I emailed. Will come back!"
3029273,210708973,2017-11-10,80429928,Steven,"Location, location, location! A short, lovely walk to the beach, past beautiful homes and stunning landscapes and tress. Parks everywhere. Low traffic and easy access to anywhere you want to go. House is modern, comfortable and inviting, especially the back patio. Little touches like the footstools for the couch and beach towels were appreciated. Aquarium passes were a nice bonus. Off-street parking a plus too. Do some restaurant research before you go. Highly recommend Passion Fish and the wine bar on Lighthouse."
3029273,214103222,2017-11-24,58939840,Stuart,Everything was great! Would stay again!
3029273,215608542,2017-11-30,149998613,Ben,Very nice! I would love to stay here again!
3029273,225507066,2018-01-06,2351534,Amanda,"This unit is perfect: great little 1 bedroom, located behind what appears to be a beautiful home, in a neighborhood that is one block from the water. We absolutely loved the unit and the neighborhood, and would love to return soon. Jim was very responsive throughout the entire stay."
3029273,227392474,2018-01-14,19650926,Ashley,"Nice, cozy bungalow. Exactly as described. We loved the outdoor space. Succulents everywhere!"
3029273,227723384,2018-01-15,165653098,Lily,Loved our stay! Just a short drive to the aquarium and loved that the host provided guest passes.
3029273,229460123,2018-01-23,34350556,Elizabeth,"Perfect for a stay in Pacific Grove - close to downtown, aquarium, and beautiful ocean views. PS - eat at Hula's!!"
3029273,232399305,2018-02-04,30943964,Katy,"Honestly, you truly can't get better then Jim's place in Monterey/Pacific Grove.  After we came back, I immediately went to look at booking next year, and price-compared.  For the amenities, location, adorableness, and Aquarium passes included, this place is the best deal for miles.  

We LOVED walking from the place to the Aquarium and Cannery Row.  It's about a 30 minute leisurely walk, and worth every second.  The walk is beautiful, and there were moments that I was literally (this is kind of embarrassing) brought to tears by how pretty it is there.  A 7 minute Lyft ride back costs maybe $10 (if you're eating late and don't want to walk).  We walked home in the dark the second night and felt safe... there were lots of other couples on the trail.  The AirBnb is beautifully outfitted with everything you could need.  Good airflow, light, the bed is comfy, the bathroom is big, there is a full kitchen, and the TV has lots of entertainment (with a comfy couch to boot).  The place is sparkling clean (and I am SO nit-picky about that).  There were a few ants, which is to be expected when you are at the coast, but not many.  Would it be weird to say that they were the cute kind of ants?  Probably.  Well, they were.  We felt safe, tucked away, quiet, and relaxed.  This is the perfect couple's getaway.  I truly could not recommend Jim's place more."
3029273,235442689,2018-02-16,167970544,Martin,"We are first time airbnb folk and it was a great introduction.  Jim very helpful and responsive, although we never met and all went very well. Everything as advertised and no surprises.  If Jim had anything to do with the weather, well done!"
3029273,238967882,2018-02-27,1360118,Michael,Very comfortable and quiet.
3029273,241097402,2018-03-07,174842887,Ashby,Our stay was amazing! We couldn’t have asked for a more cozy place to stay. It’s within walking distance of Lover’s Point and a short drive to the Aquarium! We loved that there were 2 guest passes to the aquarium which was a $100 value alone. Thanks so much Jim for the amazing place to stay!
3029273,242309893,2018-03-11,2497029,Ben,"Jim's beach house is the perfect place to stay for anyone looking to explore the Monterey + Carmel + Big Sur area. It's cute, clean, quiet/private and extremely comfortable, not to mention a short drive (or walk/bike ride) away from the water and gorgeous views."
3029273,244866241,2018-03-19,171830034,Phillip,"Great pacific grove location a block from the bay, quite neighborhood. The house was clean and cozy.  Loved the aquarium passes. Stress free stay."
3029273,245079695,2018-03-20,177731447,Anthony,Great place really nice definitely would like to come back
3029273,246103664,2018-03-24,35293496,Chuck,"Jim is a very responsive host.  Check-in was a breeze. The pictures are spot on accurate, the place is new and very clean.  Washer and dryer was a huge plus!  The location is perfect, quiet neighborhood steps away from the coastal trail.  Feels very secluded but onl (Website hidden by Airbnb) minute drive to Monterey restaurants, Aquarium, Cannery Row, etc.  Would definitely book here again.
Thanks Jim!"
3029273,246650870,2018-03-25,19471663,Divya,"Jim was a great host, and his Airbnb was in a beautiful location just a block from the ocean. The House was clean and well maintained, and Jim was a very responsive host. He also allowed us to use his Monterey aquarium guest passes, which was a bonus! Thanks Jim, we’ll definitely try and come back!"
3029273,247817698,2018-03-29,60136667,Carl,"Jim’s place is awesome, and perfectly situated to explore the Monterey and Carmel areas. Location! Location! Location!"
3029273,248157015,2018-03-30,178050882,Karis,"The space was very open, easy to figure out, and all over beautiful and comfortable"
3029273,249184048,2018-04-01,24660226,Taylor,"We would definitely stay here again! Although the address is in Pacific Grove, it's about a 10 minute drive to Monterey, which was perfect for us. Jim's place was tucked back in an adorable neighborhood and the listing is attached to the main house (of which was not in use while we were there).

The listing was portrayed accurately and we feel it was a great value. We appreciated how clean it was as well as the beautiful garden / back patio area. It was also helpful having a washer and dryer available.

Jim was very quick to respond to any questions and provided all of the information we needed to check in and make our stay easy.

I would highly recommend booking this listing.

Thanks Jim!"
3029273,249769172,2018-04-02,8073242,Erin,We had a wonderful time staying at Jim and Nina's bungalow. Communication was prompt and thorough. Everything was as advertised. The included aquarium passes made the stay a great value. All expectations were met. 5 stars!
3029273,250962960,2018-04-06,81020041,Andrew,"Great stay! Clean, great decor, quiet, and located in a great area...walking distance to the water. I would definitively recommend staying at Jim’s and I will keep his place bookmarked for future stays. 

FYI: If you plan on using the included-Aquarium passes, just make sure you plan on going to the aquarium on any day other than the one check out."
3029273,254935538,2018-04-18,36027150,Diane,"We loved the location & space and were delighted to see a pair of humming birds in the garden. Also, it was a great bonus to use the passes for the aquarium. We hired bikes for the 17 mile scenic drive and enjoyed eating at the Beach House. Lovely walks along the coast. Would recommend."
3029273,255506745,2018-04-20,80912089,Rob,"A clean, well equipped and comfy place. Great location. 17 mile drive and then down highway 1 into Big Sur was easily done in a day trip to see a stunning coastline. We arrived earlier than expected and Jim was quick to respond to our request to pick up the aquarium tickets before normal checkin time.... so trip started with an afternoon of close up views of sea otters.... that you can then see in the wild after just a short walk from Jim and Nina's place."
3457025,234141658,2018-02-11,68007789,Lauren,Karen was a superb host. Communication was excellent and prompt. The place itself was spotless and had everything one would need to feel at home. Beautiful location near the beach.
3457025,238437757,2018-02-25,11041732,Casey,"I reached out to Karen  about a week before I needed to secure a spot for my boyfriend's mother's birthday and Karen was not only quick to respond, but she was SO nice. Upon entering the home, we found a birthday card she left for my boyfriend's mom with fresh flowers-she LOVED this.  Her communication was superb, check in was flexible-which gave us more time to explore-check out wasn't until noon the next day and she left a binder with all of the house information & local hot spots. Her house was beautiful, stylish and so clean!! Space heaters in the common locations and ceiling heaters in every bathroom ( I love heaters). So much natural light, french doors that opened to an outside seating area with adirondack chairs and the views were incredible from the upstairs balconies. Two blocks away from a strip of cafes, antique shops, restaurants...you name it!  A 5 minute walk to the local grocery market and a 10 min walk to the ocean (Lover's Point). Short drive to the aquarium and cannery row, but enough away from the madness to considerate a peaceful escape. Highly recommend this space. Cozy, comfy and a successful surprise! Not too mention her huge picnic style table that our family played cards on into the wee hours of the morning and had a delicious dinner on. So great! Thanks, Karen!!!"
3457025,246578909,2018-03-25,113817022,Selma Akemi,"We spent a few days with my family. The house is beautiful, clean, well equipped and with good location. Karen was extremely helpful, left a folder with tips and events of the region. She also left some candy for us. Very sweet!
Thank you so much Karen for the wonderful days!"
3457025,248101055,2018-03-30,171515756,Jocelyn,"The house was sparkling clean from top to bottom! Karen was easy to communicate with and was a great host. The home is in a good location and was in a very pleasant, peaceful surrounding. We had an amazing time. Couldn't have been better!"
3457025,250063387,2018-04-03,18220658,Kyle,"Karen's place was outstanding! It was clean, relaxing, stylish, crazy organized, and full of every amenity we could need. She knew we were coming with a 2-year-old and had a brand new booster seat and stair gate ready, not to mention left new milk in the fridge. She was quick to respond to messages. We were able to walk everywhere, and there's a great office that opens into a bedroom perfect for sticking a pack n play within earshot but out of the way. Will stay again!"
3457025,251902690,2018-04-08,38379691,Sarah,"The photos online do this house no justice - it is absolutely gorgeous! Karen responded to every message almost immediately. The house was immaculate, stocked with everything we could possibly need, and there were even treats for the kids on our arrival. Don't miss this gem in monterey!"
3457025,253531235,2018-04-14,179164456,Kiirsten,"We loved staying in Karen’s beautiful home!! It was in a quiet neighborhood, yet the perfect location for access to the aquarium, the beach, the wharf, and a short drive to Carmel. It was a great set-up for families—large enough for everyone to spread out yet also nice to have all 3 bedrooms upstairs (important to us as we had young children). Karen was so thoughtful to anticipate the needs of families with kids—she had a nice stroller, baby/toddler booster seat, pack n play, baby gate, and a basket full of children’s books. The snacks were a fun touch, as well! House was sparkling clean, extra cozy and beautifully decorated, had everything we needed and more (including the beautiful kitchen!). Being a historic home, it was full of charming details. The backyard was also so peaceful and perfect for relaxing in the sun. Karen was a wonderful, thoughtful hostess, got back to me immediately with all my questions, and made our first experience with Airbnb a wonderful one. Will definitely return in the future!"
3821616,19013674,2014-09-04,20042602,Robert,"We loved our stay! The cottage was just a block away from restaurants and shopping, and a very short walk to Lover's Point. Alka was very available in case we had any issues, definitely will be coming back!"
3821616,19436117,2014-09-12,20451430,Alain,"Coquette petite maison très bien située pour visiter l'Aquarium de Monterey (merci pour les passes), Cannery Row et pour faire la promenade du 17 miles drive. Nous sommes aussi à quelques pas de la rue Lighthouse avec ses magnifiques boutiques et restaurants. Bien qu'Alka ne soit pas présente sur place, les communications sont faciles et rapides. À noter qu'elle parle très bien français. Je recommande cet endroit à ceux qui désirent un endroit très tranquille tout près des attraits touristiques de la région de Monterey."
3821616,19555078,2014-09-14,1653443,Keenan,"Alka was a great host. She was communicating with us well before the trip and during our stay to offer useful tips and advice for the area, as well as detailed information specific to our family's needs. The house is so comfortable and charming. We ended up retreating back to the house after a tiring day out and it was the perfect place to rest and relax."
3821616,19752208,2014-09-17,21025170,Scott,"What a wonderful cottage! I am just disappointed that I couldn't rent it longer. I highly recommend it, with a great location for easy access to shopping, restaurants and the beautiful Monterey Bay. 

Everything was clean, organized, and easy to find.

The neighborhood is very quiet, with the only noise that of seagulls on their early morning routine.

Alka is a great communicator and made me feel comfortable on my first Airbnb. I'll keep coming back--to this cottage in Pacific Grove and Airbnb!"
3821616,19842292,2014-09-19,3121420,Michelle,"The cottage was great for our needs. We went to Wholefoods and bought some cioppino and extra seafood and some crusty bread and had a wonderful dinner at the cottage! We were pleasantly surprised to find Aquarium tickets when we arrived. Great proximity for everything. Trader Joe's is just up Forest Rd a little and we were very close to start the 17 mile drive. Recommend stopping at Pebble Beach Lodge for a walk around and a drink on the deck. Very nice shopping nearby off Solidad as well as Cannery Row. Bathroom was an ensuite which was fine for my mother and me. The couch was very comfortable so I did not use the loft. 
Thanks again Alka"
3821616,20037573,2014-09-22,20741171,Julia,"We had a lovely time at Alks's cottage.  Just blocks from our favorite restaurants and walks, its location can't be beat for us. This dog friendly place was clean, bright, cheery, and comfortable. Also had great style. It is small but we never felt cramped save for the bathroom which is a little  snug. Nice family neighborhood. I also liked that bags for the farmers market are provided. So cool.
Alka was so nice to go out of her way and ensure we got guest passes for the aquarium, which saved us $80! The fresh flowers were a nice touch too."
3821616,20155909,2014-09-24,17792274,Emily,My wife and I stayed here for a couple nights on our honeymoon road trip. We had an amazing time! The cottage was so cute and the beach is a 5min walk away! We saw sea otters and seals! We highly recommend this beautiful place!
3821616,20270991,2014-09-26,3244608,Nikolas,Cute and beautiful apt which could accommodate my whole family (5 people). The location was good as well. The flat and the host were perfect!
3821616,20358434,2014-09-28,13893649,Daniel,"We loved staying here! Alka was awesome, had great communication. The home itself is very very clean. We fell in love with house. Easily one of the nicest we've stayed at on airbnb. And what a great location. We were able to walk to Lovers Point two blocks away. The path along the coast from Lovers Point to Monterey aquarium was only about 1.5 miles and we saw beached harbor seals and otters. Very cool. Would have been perfect for a run. Try renting a bike to cruise the coast too! Pacific Grove has great stores, breakfast cafés, and awesome restaurants. Great place for a stroll. If you are reading my description of Alka's cottage and think ""maybe I should?"" Do it! You will not regret staying here"
3821616,20613814,2014-10-02,20023839,Jamie,"The house was great and spacious! It was just off of the main road in Pacific Grove which has tons of restaurants, shops and bars. The beach is only about 3 blocks away and everything is within walking distance. The house was bright, clean and comfy. Everything worked properly and all amenities included were used. We brought our bikes and biked from the house to the aquarium within 5 minutes and kayaked in the bay. House stayed cool with open windows and the ceiling fan. I would definitely love to stay here again and would recommend it. Alka and her husband were easy to reach and were greats hosts. 
"
3821616,20758072,2014-10-05,20812705,Kristine,"The cottage was absolutely wonderful! It was clean, beautifully decorated and was less then a block from the little downtown area lined with shops and restaurants. It was a quick 5-10 minute walk from the beach as well.  Alka was fantastic! She gave us great suggestions for restaurants within walking distance, and checked in on us to make sure we were settled in. "
3821616,21037884,2014-10-10,16568460,Kristine,"Where do I begin? Alka was a lovely, thoughtful and kind host. The adorable cottage was perfect for a relaxing getaway before our wedding weekend in Big Sur. The cottage is airy and fresh with everything you will can need for a perfect stay. It is just a few short steps to the downtown area where every morning we started our routine at the Bookstore cafe for coffee and then the Red House for a delicious breakfast and ended our evening with a stroll down the tree lit downtown. You can walk everywhere in Pacific Grove and it is just a very short drive to Monterey, where my son is attending school.  The loft was great for our 14 year old daughter who had plenty of room and felt like she had her own space. Overall the experience was perfect. Thank you so much Alka for opening up your home and for an incredible stay.

After I booked her place she sent me recommendations for the surrounding area and was quick with her replies when I had questions. She texted me throughout my stay with more recs and just wanted to see how we were doing. Accurate description of her place and neighborhood, easy to follow instructions, and everything was as expected. Her cottage was in a great location - walkable to Red House Cafe and Passionfish. Both were highly recommended. I was a little cold at times but she had extra blankets so we used them! Loved that she had shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a hair dryer."
3821616,21383540,2014-10-16,17480299,Miriam,"My host at this place, Alka, was very attentive and helpful.  At some point we had a plumbing issue, but Alka resolved it effectively and timely.  She even gave us a gift as a thank you, which was a very sweet touch.  The little house is bright and cozy/comfortable.  The bed is comfortable, with good pillows.  Do mind getting in/out of the high bath tub, as it is slippery.  The location is great, near restaurants, the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium (walking distance).  I recommend a hike in the Point Lobos Park as well, as the views are spectacular.  I had a wonderful time unwinding from the crazy busy life I live.  Thank you, Alka, for the place and your attention and care that our stay would be very comfortable."
3821616,21516242,2014-10-19,20708466,Ralph,"We enjoyed our stay here. Our host, Alka, stayed in contact by text message and email and gave us a number to call if we had a need. We did not need anything because everything was just as promised and the location is delightful, just a short walk from shops and good places to eat.  Alka said it was a quiet street and I was pleasantly surprised how quiet.  Very peaceful. Pacific Grove is one of our favorite places to visit and staying here made it even more special.   "
3821616,21744032,2014-10-23,20869592,Kirk,Great stay at a cool little place in a great location. Very easy to get to the best spots in PG. The cottage was as described. We did have one issue that Alka responded to with much care and interest in resolution. Very impressed with the responsiveness and hospitality! Has our recommendation.
3821616,21952147,2014-10-27,21067270,Claudia,"Wow! We loved waking up in this bright and cheerful house!  It is in a perfect location in a wonderful, laid back little town....we walked to everything.  The house is located on a one way street, and there was virtually no traffic....I haven't slept like that in years!   
What a great vacation!  Wish we could have stayed longer!"
3821616,22248798,2014-11-02,10355488,Nan,"Alka was a remarkable hostess. She was very helpful in helping us pick out places to visit, she was extremely friendly, and even left us a gift for a special occasion!

The house is exact as pictured - very cozy, nestled in downtown Pacific Grove. It's within easy walking distance of quite a lot of restaurants. You can even walk to the aquarium on a nice day.

The amenities were great. Everything was clean and well organized."
3821616,22361985,2014-11-04,3311508,Justin,"Alka's place was amazing.  Plenty of natural light, which was nice since we don't get much in our apartment in downtown San Francisco.  Our Shih-Tzu, Charlie, was super comfortable with the blankets she provided.  The cottage was a block away from cafe's, restaurants, and some really nice antique shops.  And if you don't mind walking, its a relaxing stroll away from the Aquarium (a little less than 15 minutes).  I highly recommend Alka's place.  "
3821616,22486244,2014-11-08,16395572,Beth,We had a wonderful stay in the idyllic town of Pacific Grove and the cottage was perfect in every way! So much to do and everything so close. Such a darling cottage on such a quaint street. What a find!
3821616,22657005,2014-11-11,21175504,Kellie,"The cottage was so cozy & the pictures do not even do it justice! Alka was extremely accessible prior to our trip down providing recommendations for dining, entertainment & transportation. She also checked in on us part way through our stay to make sure everything was going well. The cottage is centrally located & just a couple blocks from lovers point. The bed was also super comfy! Always a plus :) "
3821616,22735348,2014-11-13,20946840,Brittany,"We had the most lovely time at the cottage in Pacific Grove! The cottage was so bright, airy, clean, and just adorable! It was only a half block walk to the main street in PG and only a couple more down to the water. Alka was such an amazing host- leaving passes to the aquarium, delicious coffee in the fridge, and countless recommendations which were all so much fun! If we ever find ourselves back in the area, which we almost certainly will because we fell completely in love with PG, we will definitely be looking up Alka and this cottage again!"
3821616,22827645,2014-11-16,1440382,Alex,"Alka was a great host! She was very good about providing all the information we would need for our trip, and gave some great recommendations for things to do / places to eat.

I highly recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a nice, clean place to stay that's centrally located in Pacific Grove. It was a very short walk to a ton of restaurants and lover's point. 

I would definitely book this place again."
3821616,22945945,2014-11-18,9376317,Hanna,"Thank you Alka!!! Such a wonderful cottage. We had a wonderful time getting away and enjoying Pacific Grove and Monterey. The cottage is so clean, comfortable and modern. We loved walking around pacific grove. We are already planning our next trip"
3821616,23026193,2014-11-20,3739531,Marijane,"It began poorly. We arrived after dark with only cell phones for flashlights. The lockbox numbers were black-on-black and there was no light on over the door: we highly recommend a motion-sensing light. We never met Alka.
Huge plus: she allowed me to bring my two collies, even though she had just that day decided not to allow pets any more.
Another huge plus: the decorating. The apartment is beautiful in a clean, Scandinavian way. The way the bathroom lurks behind the bedroom is not so good for non-couple visitors. But we did enjoy our stay very much."
3821616,23099512,2014-11-23,3406397,Brenna,"Alka's cottage was just perfect! My boyfriend and I planned a trip from LA up north and immediately fell in love with the cottage listing- we even planned our trip around the availability of the cottage and it was well worth it!  Alka was extremely helpful- she responded quickly to all messages, gave great recommendations, and checked to make sure all arrangements were to our liking for our trip.  

The cottage is in a great location- local eateries and shops within walking distance and super close to the Monterey Aquarium, which she graciously provided free passes for.  The cottage is in a residential area, but we never had an issue parking (unlike LA!). During our stay, we visited the aquarium, drove to Santa Cruz for the evening, walked around the local shops, ate at Gianni's Pizza (great pizza and gelato!) as well as Trailside Cafe for breakfast.  This cottage could not be cuter and gave us lots of future ideas for our own home (my boyfriend is demanding a loft in his next home :))

We would definitely love to make a trip back to the cottage and would recommend to anyone visiting Pacific Grove."
3821616,23240304,2014-11-26,2622323,Kaya,"Alka's cottage is so cute, perfect size for a small family or a couple. It's spotlessly clean, the living area is spacious, and the cottage stayed warm at night even though it was cold out, and bright during the day (though bedroom blinds closely and kept the bedroom shades for a nap!) the tub is great for soaking and the towels and bedding are lush. 

The location is amazing - walk to the beach, walk to cafes and shopping. And a few minute drive to the Aquarium. The tickets were a great touch and allowed is to go to the aquarium twice during our three day stay. 

Alka was very available by email, phone and messaging and gave us lots of local suggestions - including a babysitter - she checked in with is before and during our arrival to make sure we had what we needed. "
3821616,23290663,2014-11-28,9892834,Jennifer,"We would definitely go here again.  The location was central to incredible beaches, Monterey and the quaint village of Pacific Grove.  We felt like locals on an East Coast island.  This clean, fun and thoughtfully styled cottage was very quiet and comfortable.  Both my family and our pets felt completely welcomed.  "
3821616,23359692,2014-11-30,9741906,Anne,"Alka was so hospitable and helpful and available for any needs we might have.  The cottage was lovely!  A great location right off the main road in PG, immaculate and cozy.  We hope to return soon! "
3821616,23636365,2014-12-07,23215113,Penny,"The Pacific Grove cottage was in a great location on a quiet street just off Lighthouse, the commercial district.
It is well equipped.   It is light and airy inside.
"
3821616,24050337,2014-12-18,20786277,Nokkie,They sent us a welcome msg &reminder about how to get into the house. The coffee &milk in the fridge was also very well appreciated!
3821616,24403137,2014-12-28,20870586,Jennifer,"Perfect!  Perfect vacation, perfect location, and perfect place.  Simple but so thoughtful, I had real coffee, creamer and sugar available for the time of my stay.  There's also few different options for how to prepare your coffee.  The cottage is cozy and perfectly decorated.  All the right amenities are provided.  And, it's in a great location.  I enjoyed walking to the rec trail, restaurants, aquarium, shops, and Cannery Row.    "
3821616,24521766,2014-12-30,919289,Vicki,"Goddaughter wedding in pacific grove post Xmas, with dog. we got so lucky to find alka.s brilliant cottage, within walking distance of all the festivities and the village. full of light, fully equipped and stocked, entirely comfortable and immaculate. Duncan the puppy was so welcome, w special dog amenities. having thoroughly enjoyed her san francisco flat, we looked forward to alka.s style in PG: comfy beds and linens, great reading lights, sense of design,  original art and stocked pete.s coffee. the aquarium passes were enjoyed, we rode our bikes for hours soaking up the stunning coast,  visited the monarch sanctuary, caught up with friends and totally relaxed and enjoyed each other. dream days to savor, dream place to return to. thx alka and brad!"
3821616,24640529,2015-01-01,21895568,Trish,"Quaint-as-can-be town!  The location of this home is amazing - a few blocks from the beautiful coast and only 1/2 block to a gorgeous downtown filled with amazing places to enjoy food/coffee/wine/dessert/etc.  The owners of the home were VERY generous with two passes to the impressive Monterey Aquarium and a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our anniversary!  
The home was very clean and very organized - bright and sunny too!  Alka was very responsive - and had lots of wonderful recommendations for ways to spend our time in the area.  "
3821616,24915663,2015-01-04,14513659,Kristin,"Alka was an excellent host and her cottage was the perfect base for our Monterey family vacation.  The cottage was clean and well laid out, and the inclusion of the Aquarium guest passes was an awesome perk.  Thank you Alka for your hospitality!  We will be back again soon!"
3821616,25170340,2015-01-08,23190267,Lingyi,"Alka is a wonderful host! We enjoy our stay at the lovely and cozy cottage. Location is great! The cottage is close to the Monterey Bay aquarium and the sea, only few minutes of driving. Alka prepares everything well before we arrive. Her great hospitality makes us feel like at home. Also, Alka recommends a lot of great places to go just for relax. We especially enjoy our breakfast at the Red House Cafe. I'll definitely come back again if I visit PG."
3821616,25271712,2015-01-11,6530082,Susan,"Lovely cottage small but neat and clean. Near to all restaurants , Red House cafe which Alka recommended is a must try yum yum !  Free aquarium pass is the plus to the trip. Thanks Alka! "
3821616,25461736,2015-01-17,21835408,Nicole,"We had a great stay at Alka's Pacific Grove cabin. There were 3 of us, all grown adults, and we fit in the cabin perfectly, even with one of us sleeping in the loft. The kitchen is beautiful and well-equipped, and there's so much natural light that comes into the space. I wish I could live in this cabin! The cabin is clean and adorable, and feels really homey. I really liked that Alka took the time to give us suggestions for restaurants and places to visit during our stay, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes were much appreciated. The location could not have been better, with only a minute walk to the main street in Pacific Grove, and less than an 8 minute walk to the ocean. We were also able to walk right into Monterey using the Recreation Trail right along the water which was great--an awesome spot to see tons of basking harbor seals! The cottage is also within a 30 minute drive to Point Lobos State Reserve, which was my favorite hiking spot on our trip, and definitely one of the best places to experience the beauty of the West Coast. We really couldn't have had a better time at Alka's cabin, and we all agree we'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
3821616,25917356,2015-01-29,6885017,Andrea,"Both of us arrived with bad colds to our midweek getaway at Alka and Brad's lovely and light filled cottage. It was such a sweet place to land and we loved the space and the neighborhood. We definitely want to come back! We had a little trouble with getting hot water for a bath and Alka and Brad responded immediately and sent someone right over in the morning. I felt we could call on them for anything we needed. 

Thank you both for sharing your space with us and for being so attentive! We hope to stay longer next time.
"
3821616,25974457,2015-01-31,14764717,Rolanda,"What a TREAT!! Fabulous location, precious little cottage. Very comfortable and relaxing, never once missed having a TV. Thank you so much for the aquarium tickets it was incredible!! Pacific Grove is nature at its best and the 17 mile drive is a MUST well worth the $10. Also, as everyone else has said the The Red House Cafe if probably some of the best food I have had in a very long time not to mention the excellent service.  I cannot say enough about our quick trip and our hosts Alka & Brad. Thank you for an unforgettable stay and hope to visit again. "
3821616,26069609,2015-02-02,26271466,Evann,Alka was extremely responsive and helpful during the initial booking and throughout our trip. We absolutely loved the house and the neighborhood and can't wait to visit Pacific Grove again! 
3821616,26159403,2015-02-05,25769124,Margaret,"We had a wonderful time at the cottage.  Everything was there for us.  The kitchen had all we could need and so did the bathroom.  The furniture, especially the bed, was so comfortable.  Lots of room to put our stuff.     Every room had excellent lighting.  I never had to contact Alka, but felt that she was very available, by email.  Parking was never a problem.  Thank you so much, Alka."
3821616,26218668,2015-02-07,256933,Ellen,"Alka's beautifully designed cottage was perfect for our winter getaway in Pacific Grove. I'd forgotten how peaceful this little town is, and really enjoyed our off-season visit. Most of the Yelp top restaurants were within 3 or 4 blocks.  A 10-minute walk took us to the beach with miles of walking trails and beautiful ocean views.   We saw whale blows, sea otters in kelp beds, a string of dolphins and a variety of shorebirds from the Asilomar Beach trail (with binoculars). This was definitely a good find for us, and the inclusion of Aquarium tickets made it even more of a treasure.

3821616,26295846,2015-02-09,9806319,Blake,"Wow! What a wonderful trip! This cottage is clean, charming, and very special. It is in the perfect location. The communication with Alka was very easy. Make sure you listen to Alka's recommendations. If you go anywhere, go to the Red House Cafe. If you play golf, don't leave without playing the back nine at Pacific Grove Golf Links. Pacific Grove is a magical little town and you really get to experience it when you stay at this exquisite cottage. This stay was an 11 out of 10."
3821616,26464466,2015-02-13,23625412,Johan,"Alka was very professional, communicating before, during and after our stay to ensure that everything worked out fine for us. The cottage is an amazing place for a couple or a small family, as is Pacific Groove. Our only regret is that we only made a two night reservation on our road trip going south on Hwy 1. I would love to come back again and stay a bit longer since the whole family fell in love with both the cottage and the little town."
3821616,26516709,2015-02-15,20008517,Ye,"Alka, thank you for your hospitality! You always answered our questions patiently. We all love your adorable cottage. It's clean, cozy and comfortable
. Everything is amazing. Thank you for your coffee, milk, butter and aquarium pass. We all enjoyed them. It's a wonderful experience of Airbnb. I'll recommend the beautiful Pacific Grove and this cottage to my friends. We'll be back again. Thank you again!
"
3821616,26902819,2015-02-22,5446821,Sophie,"We spent a very great time at Alka's. We were 3 adults and 2 kids and it was really comfortable for the 5 of us. The cottage is very clean and exactly as it looks on pictures. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely, Alka gave us very goods advices so we could enjoy it as if we've always come there.
We mostly like visiting the Monterey Aquarium and spending a day in Big Sur's beautiful Pfeiffer Beach. We've loved our stay in Pacific Grove and definitely recommend it."
3821616,27093498,2015-02-25,25401868,Judi,"Alka and Brad have lovingly restored this little cottage, so that its modern amenities and personal mementoes provide a welcoming, comfortable, and interesting home away from home. Over our stay of four nights, it has been ideal for the two of us, with plenty of storage, lots of towels, supplies of coffee, and creamer to ensure a nice start to the day. Guest passes to the Monterey Aquarium were a generous touch. We found the neighbourhood quiet, friendly, and safe. Street parking was easy the first two days, a bit tricky the next two. Alka is extremely knowledgeable about this area, and her recommendations for places of interest and local restaurants highlighted the best representation of Pacific Grove. This is a lovely community with many outdoor pursuits easily available, and this little cottage has been a great home base. Alka made herself readily available in the event we needed anything."
3821616,27159869,2015-02-27,9336538,Richard,"Alka and Brad's flat was just lovely! It's filled with lots of natural light, close to the ocean and decorated beautifully. Pacific Grove itself is a great little town with lots of good bakeries (one at the end of the road) and restaurants. It's also perfectly situated for visiting Monterey, Big Sur and Carmel.

Alka was great to deal with - communicative, very friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back!"
3821616,27246801,2015-03-01,16477712,Louie,"We enjoyed our stay at the Bright Beach cottage. Alka was a very gracious host. The location was perfect, half a block walking distance from the Pacific Grove strip. The accommodations were just right for my wife and I. The place is very clean and decorated just right for the size. We would definitely stay at this location again."
3821616,27570728,2015-03-08,4168982,Tom,"Great location. Very easy to get to, find parking, and get into the place.  Clean cottage and all the things you need to be comfortable.  Highly recommended! "
3821616,27755191,2015-03-11,23128698,Don,Cottage was lovely and very close to Community Market and excellent restaurants.  Neighborhood friendly and quiet.  Parking was not a problem.  Retail just steps away!
3821616,27919246,2015-03-15,6077048,Dori,"We didn't get to meet Alka, but she was a terrific host!  Before it even occurred to me to wonder how we would get into the cottage, she sent a terrific email with all of the info we needed.  The cottage was adorable and just the right size for two of us, though monkeys (or good climbers ;-)) could be happy on the loft futon.  The bathroom is tiny, but I loved the charming clawfoot tub.  The bed was very comfortable, which, in my experience, is unusual in AirBnB rentals--they tend to be too hard for us, and I really appreciated the fan in the bedroom, since it's hard for me to sleep without moving air.  Parking is on-street, so sometimes it was a bit of a challenge, but we always found something.  Mostly, we walked everywhere, since so many things were so close by!  We appreciated tips for where to go and where to eat and had a lovely dinner at Passionfish just 2 blocks away.  Loved the aquarium, too.  Can't wait to come back!"
3821616,28158507,2015-03-19,8627446,Levi,"Alka was an amazing host.  I booked the cottage for my parents while they were visiting NoCal.  Alka was extremely accommodating, gave great recommendations on things to do/see, provided excellent directions for check-in and check-out, and made sure to touch base during the stay just to make sure everything was ok.  My parents had nothing but praise for the cottage - perfect walking distance to everything in town, great restaurants nearby, they absolutely loved it!  Would book again in a heartbeat."
3821616,28377525,2015-03-23,24040914,Stefani,"We enjoyed our stay at Alka and Brad's adorable cottage! It was perfect for our weekend full of wedding festivities. My husband calls the cottage our ""new home away from home."" The location is great, walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove, little bit longer walk to the ocean, 5 minute drive to Cannery Row, 20 minutes to Carmel. Everything you need to including a full kitchen to make you feel right at home. Wonderful hosts!! "
3821616,28512559,2015-03-25,24631660,Chela Rae,"Alka was so great in communicating with us and making sure that our stay was great! Everything about this place was perfect - from clean, bright rooms to the nice airflow from all the windows. We cooked the first night in the kitchen and it was stocked with everything that we needed. The couches and bed were extremely comfortable and we did not have any trouble getting a good night's sleep. We loved the loft area! We went up there just to play cards under the skylight at night! Kids would love this - its like a little clubhouse! The included aquarium tickets were also a wonderful addition that brought back nostalgic memories. 

Pacific Grove is such a beautiful little town and is just close enough to Monterey that you can walk. We walked from Lover's Point to the Aquarium in about 20-30 mins - of course stopping along the way to take in the gorgeous scenery. We would recommend this cottage to anyone staying in Pacific Grove/Monterey area - just perfect! 
Thank you!

Chela and Andrew "
3821616,28620213,2015-03-27,1760217,Lauren,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I couldn't have been happier! The pad is so awesome and stylish. I wanted to live there! It's just a few blocks from the ocean, beach and trail that take you straight to the aquarium. How wonderful! We enjoyed cooking in the sweet kitchen and had all the windows open letting an ocean breeze glide through. It was perfection. This place will bring a smile to you face and you won't want to leave! I would eventually like to come back here just to work it was so relaxing (I work from home). Thanks Alka!"
3821616,28693689,2015-03-29,1715690,Kathryn,"My husband and I already can't wait to come back here! Alka's cottage was so well thought out, decorated so nicely, and so relaxing and comfortable that we didn't want to leave. Usually when we've done Air BnB, it's about the city we're staying in, but this cottage was a destination in and of itself for us. It was wonderful to have no TV or computer glowing at us and the charming neighborhood was very quiet, despite the houses being older and close together. The entire experience was just wonderful and made us take big sighs of relief to be on a short vacation."
3821616,28863704,2015-03-31,541508,Philip,"This was one of the best Airbnb stays we have had!  The cottage is spacious, immaculately clean and well appointed with all the amenities you could need.  Alka was a great host and communication was always detailed and timely. If you are planning a stay in Monterey this is the perfect place to base yourself!"
3821616,29158158,2015-04-05,5245398,Kristen,"The perfect little beach bungalow in PG. Loved every minute we were there! My husband, father-in-law, and my 1 year old all had a blast! We hit up the beach, aquarium a couple times, and all the local restaurants. Alka was so warm and welcoming...and spot on with the restaurant suggestions! The cottage was EXACTLY as I had viewed online which was awesome. Thank you for having us!!!"
3821616,29635090,2015-04-10,2984535,Jared,"Such a beautiful house and on a quiet picturesque street.  Within walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove and a short hop to Lover's point, Monterey Bay Aquarium and 17-Mile Drive.  We stayed with my mother, wife and 3 year old daughter and had a great time.  House is very clean and well maintained; it suited us well.  Our one critique is that the hot water heater is only 30gl, which is fine for a shower, but not so great for a bath.  There's a photo of the nice claw-foot bathtub in the listing, but the amenities do not list a bath as being available.  We called Alka when there was no more hot water and we were left with a lukewarm bath.  She told us the situation, which was unfortunate, but understandable.  I'm glad she was easily reachable, but it would've been helpful to know about the hot water situation beforehand so we could plan accordingly.  "
3821616,30065237,2015-04-17,25822016,Gus,"We had a great experience at Alka and Brad's cottage. From the moment we booked the place in January, Alka was extremely helpful and accommodating. She went out of her way to recommend restaurants and activities in the Monterrey area, many of which we tried and loved. In particular, cocktails around the patio fires at sunset at The Inn At Spanish Bay was one of the best moments of our trip. 

The cottage was fantastic. All appliances worked, and the whole place was spotless. It's in a great location as the coast of Pacific Grove and many great restaurants along Lighthouse Ave. are easily accessible by foot. Carmel, Monterey, and Pebble Beach are all within, at most, a 15 minute drive. Parking was no problem along the street at the cottage. It was very easy to get into upon arrival. 

The booking came with 2 tickets to the Monterey Aquarium, which was incredible. The aquarium is one of the best we've visited, plus there was a ton of Humpback Whale activity out in the bay about 100 yards from the Aquarium viewing deck. So cool.

I highly recommend staying here for a vacation on the Monterey Peninsula. There is no TV, but we felt it was for the better, since there is so much to see and do in the area.  Free wireless is provided so you can always stream movies on your ipad or laptop if needed. "
3821616,30188499,2015-04-19,22579163,Christina,The beach cottage was so cute and quaint. The perfect space for our romantic weekend getaway. The beach and great food were all within walking distance. We hope to visit again soon!
3821616,30543366,2015-04-24,25554504,Chris,Had an amazing stay in pacific grove and highly recommend this beautiful cottage. It is our first big holiday with our 9month old daughter and we loved having our own space and a place to cook (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a fantastic location just a few blocks from the gorgeous coastline-highly recommend a morning run to watch the (Website hidden by Airbnb) is also great to explore the 17mile drive to Carmel and it's beaches as well as a lovely stroll along to Monterey aquarium and cannery row.the aquarium tickets were just another great thing the gracious hosts offer as well as lots of recommendations. We even saw seal pups on the beach. Thanks again for a fantastic stay!
3821616,30853995,2015-04-28,18174921,Jessica,"We chose Alka's cottage as our home base for the Big Sur Marathon this past weekend. We could not have picked a more inviting and relaxing place for our first AirBnB experience! The location is perfect - whether you want to explore the Monterey Bay Aquarium (the passes were a huge perk!), take a trip down gorgeous 17-Mile Drive to go shopping in Carmel, or simply enjoy an evening cuddling on the couch (the Wifi was plenty speedy for streaming Netflix). I loved that there was so much closet/drawer space, and because they were labeled, I never had difficulty finding anything. We had the chance to both cook in the cottage (she thought of every essential we might need) and use Alka's restaurant recommendations (Red House Cafe and Passionfish were outstanding!). Parking was on the street, but the neighborhood was quiet and we never had trouble finding a spot. If you are considering staying here, do yourself a favor and book it already. We can't wait to go back! "
3821616,31172805,2015-05-03,2839646,Brittany,We had a great stay the bright beach cottage. It looked exactly like the photos. The furnishings are nice and very comfortable. The cottage is very clean and the abundance of windows makes it very bright and cheery. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends. Communication with the owner was very easy and she responded to my questions very quickly. 
3821616,31626210,2015-05-08,3233802,Katie,"My husband and I spent a week here to relax and do some hiking. We had a wonderful time! The home had everything we needed, from kitchen utensils to extra blankets, and more. Plus it was a convenient walk to great coffee shops, restaurants, and running paths, and a short drive to fantastic hiking. We can't wait to return!"
3821616,31762337,2015-05-10,3240556,Veronica,"This place is amazing! The cottage is clean, bright, and so comfortable. It's also beautifully decorated and so pleasing. We had no trouble finding things around the cottage as items are clearly labelled, and Alka is only a text away if you need to contact her. 
There was plenty of parking on the same street as the cottage. Downtown Pacific Grove is a great alternative to all the hectic tourist activity on Cannery Row. Here, there are plenty of delicious places to eat and entertainment within walking distance. We even walked to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the American Tin Cannery shops. 
Three of us slept quite comfortably: one in the lovely queen bed (who didn't mind being en route to the bathroom), one on the comfortable and surprisingly wide couch (with a couple of blankets from the storage), and one in the loft (with a skylight that opens if it gets too hot). 
Definitely plan on staying here again!"
3821616,31902342,2015-05-11,5382980,Jane&Ben,"Wow, what a place!!  The only regret was only having one night to stay there.  It really is as lovely as it looks in the pictures.  Alka sent through fantastic instructions and local recommendations, including checking in with us the day before we arrived.  And sleeping in a loft is so much fun!
On our previous visit to Monterey we hadn't visited the Pacific Grove area.  Is now our area of choice :)  Lots of lovely little shops and restaurants within a short walk.  And there is a Trader Joes and Safeway within five minutes drive, which we made the most of to enjoy dinner in the lovely kitchen.  Having the two Aquarium passes to use offers great value. 
Hope to get the opportunity to come back! :)"
3821616,32158544,2015-05-15,2929661,Debbie,"Alka was really easy to work with in renting her Pacific Grove cottage.  The cottage was neat, clean and conveniently located to everything we needed.  I especially liked the list of recommendations for restaurants and activities that Alka left.  The Monterey Aquarium passes were an added bonus.  We arrived after dark and her instructions for the getting the key were easy to follow.   When we left, we accidentally put our house key back in the key box instead of her key, but Alka quickly notified us before we left town so we could make the switch which showed me that she closely monitored the change over from one quest to the other so things would not get overlooked.  guests. This cottage was quiet and bright and I would recommend it to anyone visiting the Pacific Grove area.
"
3821616,32448751,2015-05-18,25857204,Shayna,"Alka did a great job of orienting us to her lovely cottage and the area.  We found the keys and settled into our home away from home easily.  Great, great location; Pacific Grove is by far the best place to be in the Monterey area.  Lots of restaurants as well as the beach in easy walking distance (a few  blocks).  Clean and tidy digs, lovely historic beach bungalow.  Small and cozy, perfect for a couple."
3821616,32751678,2015-05-21,17881200,Rachael,"My mother and I stayed here for 3 nights in May to see Monterey and Carmel. We loved it! Super cute neighborhood with lots of good food, close to everything. And Alka made sure we knew she was available anytime to help out with anything we needed. Great place to stay!"
3821616,32904731,2015-05-23,24681253,Will,What a beautiful house! I'm very happy to live in here. Everything is great and clean. 
3821616,32998329,2015-05-24,2074159,Elaine,"Alka is a terrific e-host, always available to respond to queries and help out.  We had a mishap with the reservations early on, and it was so easy to fix, I suspect because we had similar (very) positive attitudes.  The street was adorable, the cottage was incredibly well kept, the thoughtful touches like window box flowers,  farmers market bags hanging on the hooks, coffee and milk available and soothing interior decor colors.  My family asked when can we return...you betcha!"
3821616,33491375,2015-05-29,6787472,Edward,"The cottage is really cute and in a great location. Alka and Brad gave us loads of great hints and tips for things to do and even left us their passes for the aquarium. There's lots to do in Monterey - our favourite was the whale watching when we saw about 30 humpback whales. 

Alka was really quick to respond whenever we had a question and was really helpful. 

Great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone. "
3821616,33643071,2015-05-31,459434,Lynn,"My mom and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bright Beach Cottage in Pacific Grove. Cute and clean and tidy. Comfy beds. Airy and filled with light even on overcast days. Took a nice nap in the loft. Woke to a fun seagull squawking through the skylight. He landed both early evenings outside the skylight like clockwork at 7 pm.

The cottage is very conveniently located to walk to restaurants
(Passionfish & Red House highly recommended) and shops in PG. We took MST transit bus into Monterey to go to the Aquarium and back. Bus stops right nearby. Aquarium membership also gave us 10 % discount in the giftshop so if you need a stuffed toy shark, use the card!

Would definitely come again to Bright Beach Cottage. Thanks Alka and Brad for providing a delightful place to stay."
3821616,33980059,2015-06-03,18410681,Chelsea,"The cottage was incredibly cute, bright, open, and perfectly situated. While driving down to the house you can see the ocean and the aquarium is very close by. The member passes are also very convenient, we didn't have to wait in a line at all. The bed is very comfy and the loft makes a great place for movies at night. Although the hosts were away during our stay they were easy to contact and always very nice and accommodating! Would definitely recommend and will be returning"
3821616,34123305,2015-06-05,16725860,Robert,This place is exactly as described! We really felt at home as soon as we arrived! The housekeeper was really nice and the reservation was without a hitch. Great communication with host and overall great experience!
3821616,34526401,2015-06-09,29763806,Cortland,"Alka and Brad's cottage felt very cozy and was in pristine shape. We instantly felt at home here. The neighborhood is quiet with lots of cute shops just around the corner and the beach within walking distance. Anyone looking for a quaint and quiet getaway should look no further. The hosts provided a litany of activities and restaurants to check out, which was very helpful and much appreciated. The Aquarium tickets were definitely a plus as well. I spoke with Alka and she couldn't have been kinder and more accommodating. Not only is the house itself a draw, but it was immediately clear to me that the hosts cared a lot about making us feel right at home. "
3821616,34842249,2015-06-13,18756173,Kirsty,"We simply loved this beautiful little cottage! The location within Pacific Grove and surrounding area is ideal and it was only a short walk down to the coast. The cottage was well equipped and beautifully decorated & the lack of a TV meant that we fully relaxed and enjoyed our surroundings. 
Alka was the perfect host & the aquarium tickets a real benefit. The places recommended to eat at were also great - we only have good things to say about this place! "
3821616,35446197,2015-06-19,25314311,Fredrik,"We had a great stay at this very clean, charming and well kept cottage! Tastefully decorated and equipped with everything you need. We were two adults and two children (5 and 10) and it did not feel crowded at all. 

The neighbourhood is very nice and most of the restaurants and the ocean is walkable. "
3821616,36168206,2015-06-26,21779959,Helene  C D,"Det var enkelt å finne det lille huset i 18th Street, Pacific Grove. Vi fant parkeringsplass rett over gaten. Like yndig, friskt, lyst og smakfullt fremsto stedet som på bildene i annonsen! En sommerfølelse fyller det lille huset og det er lett å puste! Alt er vel tilrettelagt for oss som kommer nye til huset. Frodig minihage med sitrontre og blomster, alt så velstelt og lekkert. Nabolaget var stille, men likevel rett ved hyggelig butikkgate med restauranter."
3821616,36374538,2015-06-28,11610753,Shawdi,"I cannot recommend this listing enough! Though we did not get to meet them in person, Alka and Brad were incredible hosts. They provided so much hospitality and made us feel so welcome. Pacific Grove is the cutest, most charming town, and the Cottage was in a perfect location to walk around and explore. 

Alka and Brad sent us a full list of recommendations and tips, so we felt like locals during our stay! We cannot wait to come back and stay here again!"
3821616,36873608,2015-07-02,33231383,Diane,"The cottage is adorable and cozy, exactly as described and photographed. It is small but perfect for 2 people. We were 2 adults and 3 teens, which was a lot for the small space but it was still fine. The neighborhood is amazing. I loved going on walks and looking at all the cute houses and shops. We were a short walk from the beach. We walked to the Monterrey aquarium, which was not far. The town of Pacific Grove is just lovely and i wish we could have stayed a week.   Alka and Brad were exceptional hosts. From the beginning, Alka was friendly and gave us lots of advice on places to go.  When there was a plumbing issue, they had it fixed immediately. I would absolutely go back - maybe next time without the kids :)"
3821616,37034598,2015-07-04,28019004,Barbara,"We found the cottage very cozy for our 2 night stay in Pacific Grove. It was conveniently placed for local shops, restaurants and Monterey Aquarium which is about a mile walking distance . The cottage is on a quiet one way street and we barely noticed traffic noise. We had everything we needed . The bed was comfortable in the bedroom and there was plenty of hot water. The cottage was clean, bright and welcoming. Alka kept in touch with us before arrival . 2 adult guest passes for Monterey Aquarium are provided and it is a must to visit as it is fabulous. "
3821616,37278959,2015-07-06,7052319,Cindy,"Daar Alka and Brad,  What a great experience to stay in such a unique cottage in such lovely town! We truely loved our 2-night stay and were charmed by the mixture of old and modern elements in the cottage. Wonderful to walk along the coastline in the evening and nice restaurants and shops are close at hand. The Aquarium tix were great , we used them early in the morning before the crowds came in: thanks for that !!! "
3821616,37941244,2015-07-12,24416114,Corey,The place was great.  Supper clean and organized.  The location was even better!  Once we got there we were able to walk anywhere we wanted to visit while there including all the restaurants.  Wife definitely wants a return visit :)

Der Ort Pacific Grove versprüht einen außergewöhnlichen  Charme durch seine historischen Häuser und die einzigartige Lage am Pazifik. Läden und Restaurants sind fussläufig erreichbar. Wir waren drei Tage dort im Rahmen einer größeren USA-Reise. In jedem Fall lohnt sich der Besuch im Monterey Bay Aquqrium. Die zwei Tickets sind ein echter Pluspunnkt. Insgesamt eine sehrempfehlenswerte Adresse für Urlauber, die eine Unterkunft mit einer persönlichen Note suchen."
3821616,38977032,2015-07-20,25702272,Lindsay,"What a wonderful little cottage in a beautiful location. Perfect for our three day stay - we took in the aquarium which is spectacular and the passes save you $70, a cycle along the front and of course lots of time on Lovers  point Beach. The accommodation is spotless and well kitted out, it is airy and light with a lovely beach feel to it. Alka was very helpful as this was our first Airbnb and her restaurant recommendations are worth trying "
3821616,39261332,2015-07-22,23827359,Sam & Megan,"We had a really lovely stay in Monterey in Alka and Brads accommodation. The restaurant recommendations were really helpful, we enjoyed a beautiful meal
at Passionfish. The cottage was clean, tidy and cosy, will definitely recommend to others.  "
3821616,39480130,2015-07-24,29185196,Chantal,"Merci beaucoup Alka,

Quel charmant petit chalet de plage, si coquet et si bien décoré! Situé moins d'un coin de rue de la rue principale, à proximité de tout. Même le super aquarium de Monteray Bay est à distance de marche.  Quel incroyable aquarium, de loin le plus intéressant à visiter et il ne faut pas manquer le ""open sea feeding"", il faut profiter pleinement de ces précieuses passes (merci encore Alka!) puisque les gros poissons (thon et mahi mahi) ne sont nourris qu'à tous les deux jours. Et oui, nous avons eu la chance d'y aller plus d'une fois.

Le 17 miles drive est très agréable surtout pour les amateurs de golf qui apprécieront voir de près le 18ième trou.

Si vous avez à faire de la lessive, j'ai eu droit à un service impeccable chez Sudz à environ 2 coins de rue; café, thé et eau filtrée à volonté et un coup de main pour s'y retrouver avec les machines, le détergeant et même le détachant. Sans compter le wi fi et toutes les revues disponibles pour faire passer le temps presque trop rapidement.  

Nous avons soupé chez Peppers et en plus des portions très généreuses, la Margarita est divine.

En terminant, nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre trop court séjour dans ce petit paradis de Pacific Grove.

Merci pour tout,

Chantal, Éric, Mathilde et Guillaume"

The first time we have used AirBnB and if they are as good as this in the future then we will be very happy indeed. Alka does a great job answering questions and preparing you for your stay so you feel like you know what to do, where to eat etc when you get there. Thanks again, Dominic, Sarah, Ethan and Elliott."
3821616,40705591,2015-08-02,21577637,Leena,We had a wonderful stay at Alka's cottage. Pacific grove is peaceful and calm. We loved wandering around the area .Dont miss the Point Lobos state park which is very very closeby. Alka was in touch with us always and inquiring about our stay etc. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wishes to experience the Pacific coast drive and its surroundings. The Aquarium passes were very very helpful and it saved us quite a bit in the fees. Thank you Alka.

It's really close to some great restaurants and cafes and only a few minutes walk from the ocean. Brad and Alka were very attentive and responded to any questions immediately. We used the aquarium tickets and couldn't recommend it more."
3821616,43601795,2015-08-21,27175465,Peter,"Bright Beach Cottage is a delightful place. It was our first verse Airbnb experience and Alka's advice, prompt responses and care to ensure that we had a good time were appreciated. 
The cottage certainly is 'bright', well equipped, comfortable and very easy to run. It's easy to find and extremely handy for the local area. We had everything that we needed (including a kettle -something which we Brits need but many U.S. places seem not to provide!) 
The description was accurate; it was very clean and had a lovely feel.  Guidance on local eateries was helpful. The Red House was great, and so handy. 
The Aquarium tickets were very much appreciated. -Great place. There was information on the local area. We chose a day's trip along Route 1 to Big Sur. We stopped at Nepenthe, (great views) and then returned having lunch at Rocky Point (we loved it; great setting and had good views of a whale quite close to shore). Next stop was at Point Lobos....loved this too - good strolls along the headland with the privilege of watching pods of humpback whales blowing, breaching and jumping. Otters, sea lions and seals plus a hosts of seabirds too. "
3821616,44404356,2015-08-26,29160619,Phil,"Thank you Alka and Brad for having us stay in your wonderful cottage.

It is in a fabulous location, very accessible to great restaurants and shops. The ocean and beautiful trails are only a few blocks away too.

Bright, cherry cottage, great for a couple, bathroom a bit tiny, shower kind of funky and you need to climb over tub to enter, but lovely location, super helpful hosts and property exactly as described.  We did so many active fun things in walking distance like the aquarium, a great walking oceanside bath, biking the 17 mile drive (it is not flat in spite of my husbands promise it was). a great hike on a days drive to Big Sur, don't miss it, and kayaking with sea life up close!  Lovers point is a great place to watch the sunset and the beach below is family friendly. A Mexican restaurant up the road called Michael's, don't miss it, nothing fancy buy yummy and great philosophy. The loft if not kid safe and has not safety feature, glad our grandchildren were not there!  Everything else was outstanding."

My boyfriend and I had the best time staying in Pacific Grove. The cottage was roomy for the both of us and everything was modern, updated and clean. The cottage is located at a prime location near restaurants, coffee shops and much more. Alka's recommendations were spot on and she was super helpful with everything! Monterey is a short drive away and the aquarium tickets were so awesome to have. Thank you for everything Alka, we can't wait to stay here again!

PS- Character's Bar was super helpful during the power outage that we experienced. Shout out to Erin and the rest of you for keeping everyone sane during the ""Apocalypse"" :) "

3821616,52813458,2015-11-02,29288785,John,"This little cottage was ideal for me.  Very comfortable and very quiet.  Being on a one-way street in a residential neighborhood, there was very little traffic or noise.  The accommodations were  complete and accurately described by Alka.  Although I traveled to this area for a conference and spent most of my time in meetings, I was able to explore the surroundings, finding the attractions close by within walking distance.  The passes to the Aquarium were a nice touch.  The area is beautiful, the accommodations awesome, and when I return to the area I will definitely stay here again!"

The neighborhood where the cottage is located is adorable with cute shops and good restaurants just around the corner. We had breakfast at The Red House twice. Within a few minute walk is a small grocery store, great for picking up milk, beer and other essentials. I would recommended this cottage to friends. Thanks for a great stay!"

Great cooking facilities. The aquarium was worth visiting so the passes were an appreciated touch. My only qualms are that the bed is narrow for two and the hot water was patchy (seemed fine in the morning for showers but in the afternoon when I wanted to run a bath it was pretty much cold). Apart from those minor irks, the place was great and we had a lovely stay. "

We played cards all night long, and walked everywhere! It is cozy, but not too small. There was plenty of towels, clean sheets and extra blankets for us. Alka's emails were incredibly detailed and prompt. Bright, Clean, Warm & felt like Home immediately. "
3821616,54698843,2015-11-23,12621996,Natalie,"We had a very pleasant stay. The cottage is walking distance from downtown Pacific Grove and Lover's Point. The hosts respond promptly and are very helpful with any issues. The place was extremely clean and the kitchen well equipped. They let us drop our belongings off earlier, which was really nice of them. The only small minuses were a wall unit heater located in the living room and not in the bedroom, and the mattress which was on the soft end."
3821616,54848041,2015-11-25,42647448,Colette,"My small family of four decided to venture to Monterey for the first time ever to celebrate my 30th birthday. This was our first experience with AirBnB and it was just wonderful. Being able to have the guest passes to the Aquarium was great since we have two small children. The small cove beach that is down the street within walking distance was perfect for us. The cottage was lovely, perfect size for us! Great for our seven year old but the ladder leading to the loft was hard with our two year old. Having a kitchen was perfect. The Hosts were literally a text away the whole time, very prompt responses when we had any questions! Definitely recommend this place to everyone, but having older children is best! My husband and I would stay here again in a heart beat!"
3821616,55097631,2015-11-28,1972411,Aj,Great location and setup. We were really happy with the entire stay. I wouldn't change anything. I particularly liked how well organized the place was. It made for easy settling in. 
3821616,55818544,2015-12-06,48568408,Jackie & Andrew,"We decided to celebrate our 9 year wedding anniversary as a family in Monterey this year. We are a small family of 4. This was our first ever experience with airbnb. I can't express enough how much of an amazing time we had. Our children (We have a 2 year old and 3 year old) had an absolute blast at the aquarium. We walked the path from Lovers Beach to the Aquarium (just over a mile) and it was breathtaking. Also, having the Main Street of Pacific Grove just steps away was absolutely fantastic. The first night there was caroling all along the main strip that we could sip hot chocolate, listen to and enjoy. 
The cottage was so cozy and welcoming. Alka and Brad had everything you could possibly need. And it was so nice that they were only a text away. Being able to make our meals in the kitchen was lovely!! Perfect size for a smaller family of 4. I would absolutely recommend this cottage to anyone! Looking forward to visiting again. "
3821616,56377403,2015-12-13,39535147,John,"I can't say enough about Brad and Alka's wonderful cottage in picturesque Pacific Grove. The cottage was clean, had all of the amenities (and more!), and was in a great location less than a block from Pacific Grove's Main Street  and a few blocks from the ocean. It was the perfect place for my now (!) fiancée and I to celebrate the rest of our lives together.  The beautiful sunset at Asilomar State Beach was the perfect place to ask her if she would marry me, and she said yes!  We will always remember that weekend and our stay. Thank you again."
3821616,56713599,2015-12-17,35254645,Nathan,"Solid communication with host.  Cottage was accurately described.  Pictures were helpful.  The street was very quiet most of the day.  Though the houses are close enough that you can sometimes hear people coming and going.  The kitchen was well-equipped.  Everything was very clean.  The greatest asset of this place is the location.  We walked everywhere we went - the beach, the bakery, dinners, shopping.  We loved being so close to everything.  "
3821616,57020850,2015-12-21,2959376,Charlotte,"Alka's Pacific Grove Cottage was clean, modernized, organized, charming and quiet.  The cottage was stocked with everything we needed and then some.  She has carefully thought through every detail and the rental listing is maintained with integrity and care.  The photos provided do an excellent job of honestly presenting the space.  The cottage was easily accessible to downtown and the waterfront on foot which was wonderful.  Alka was very easy to communicate with and always responded quickly and professionally.  She went out of her way to make sure we felt welcomed and comfortable.  "
3821616,57501260,2015-12-27,37496754,Tim,"A memorable Christmas with our tiny tree from Trader Joe's.

Alka and Brad were wonderful (and patient) for these Airbnb newbies. Be sure to read all their information carefully—they tell you all you need to know.

The cottage and neighborhood are adorable. (Apparently this was once part of a Methodist retreat; people maintained tent cabins and came in by rail. Later they were rebuilt in wood. Don't worry, you're not sleeping under canvas!) 

The kitchen is well laid-out, and the Wifi is fast. The bed is comfy. 
And the location is outstanding, an easy walk to everything PG. Of course, the Aquarium never disappoints.

FYI note: Most ladders have a little tilt to them. But the ladder to the loft here is perfectly vertical, so it can be challenging if you're anxious or have creaky old joints. The Daughter, who is a climber, had no problem, of course."
3821616,57867570,2015-12-30,8925292,Dmitriy,"The location of this cottage was perfect for exploring Pacific Grove and Monterey. It is on a quiet street within walking distance of Pacific Grove downtown, Cannery Row and most sights. The host was wonderful in communication. The cottage is small but very convenient  and charming. There is a queen bed in the bedroom, a sofa in the living room for one, and another sleeping space in the loft under the roof but that one is best left for teenagers because of access. We were very comfortable here. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
3821616,58198732,2016-01-01,49213704,Kristin,"This cottage was just perfect for our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 littles)!  It was indeed bright, clean, and welcoming with lots of extras (good coffee, shampoo, ect).  The location is great with many restaurants literally at the end of the street.  Also within walking distance is Lover's Point (about 10 minutes) and Cannery Row/Aquarium (about 25 minutes along the water).  The PG gate for 17 Mile Drive is also close by which is a fun little route for any golf lover.  Alka and Brad were fantastic hosts always responding promptly to any question I had.  We took advantage of Alka's recommendations for sights to see and places to eat, and she was spot on with each one.  We had a great time during our stay, and my only regret is that we needed a few more days to really explore the area."
3821616,58530056,2016-01-03,45892233,Elvia,"The Beach Cottage was very nice and clean. You can tell that attention has been paid to detail and it really pays off. The location of this cottage is so good! You are walking distance to the aquarium (beautiful walk), the Red House (yummy food) beaches, parks and the Monarch Sanctuary. Would definitely recommend. "
3821616,59559894,2016-01-12,6968534,Sheri,This lovely little cottage was just perfect and so comfortable to visit. Alka is a great host and everything was just he it was described. Perfect location for walks along the ocean and great restaurants.  Cannot wait to come back! Many thanks
3821616,59918486,2016-01-17,45760666,Kerry,"This place is fabulous. It is in a great location, walking distance from food, shops and beautiful (actually stunning) views of Pacific Grove coastline. Alka made herself available for any needs we had and had the fridge stocked with essentials like coffee, creamer, sugar, etc. I would whole-heartedly recommend this home to anyone."
3821616,60261940,2016-01-21,9415,Stacy,"Alka was extremely accommodating. The apartment was great - cute, comfortable, everything was just as described, well labeled, and in a great location. Alka was a great communicator, and made loads of special arrangements for our stay. Great place!"

3821616,60574703,2016-01-25,2139530,Tina & Christian,"We had a great stay at the Bright Beach Cottage. Check in and check out could not have been easier, we had an easy time parking, and we were comfortable in this cozy place. The aquarium passes were a huge plus and the location was in walking distance to many, many great restaurants and a short drive over to the aquarium and all kinds of excitement in the area."
3821616,60977772,2016-01-30,48295744,Cody,"Alka was very kind and welcoming, she met us at the flat and showed us everything we would need. The flat was very clean and nicely appointed on a very quiet street and only a block away from great restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay here again! "
3821616,62229564,2016-02-13,35912749,Liz,The cottage was perfectly suited to our needs -  very comfortable and great location.  The host checked in frequently to be sure things were going ok.  The description was accurate. The neighborhood is quiet. 
3821616,63771710,2016-02-27,2028537,Aliz,"Just returned home after 9 days at Alka's house in Pacific Grove.  We were able to get into the house with no problem and were pleased with the location.  Overall, here are the pluses and minuses:
Pluses:
Light!  The living room is always filled with light and the house has an airy feeling
The living room and kitchen are roomy
The location is fantastic

Minuses:
The bathroom is small and the clawfoot tub could be a bit hazardous for older people to get into and out of, but the matt inside the tub is really non-skid and helped a lot.
The couch and chair in the living is difficult to maneuver out of if you're older.

Overall:  The two minuses were more than compensated for by the location and the light inside the house.   We had a wonderful stay!
"
3821616,64442782,2016-03-04,55206582,Emmet,Very cute and well kept place!! Walking distance to everything and a nice quiet area. Loved it. 
3821616,64762898,2016-03-08,50369566,Crystal,Loved the adorable cottage! Was so nice to have a whole house for our selves for our wedding day and honeymoon weekend! Thank you so much for the aquarium tickets! We LOVED being able to go! 
3821616,65501887,2016-03-15,7062077,Mandy,"I loved the cottage, but I have one complaint.  First the good: The cottage is super cute and looks just like it does in pictures.  I loved all the natural light that came into the cottage and you can't ask for a better location. It's within walking distance to many bakeries and coffee shops.
The host was very welcoming and provides a great list of suggestions on things to do and places to eat.  The aquarium passes come in very handy as well.
My only complaint is the host tried to come to the cottage once and actually did come by the cottage another time during my 6-day stay.  The first time the host asked was two days prior to my check-in and she wanted movers to have access to the cottage during my stay in order to remove some furniture as well as bring in some new furniture.  I was staying at the cottage the week of my wedding, therefore I felt uncomfortable allowing anyone in the cottage, especially b/c it was a hectic time and I was going to be in and out all week.  Fortunately the host respected my wishes and did not schedule movers while I was there.
However, the owners did stop by unannounced the day after my wedding where my husband and I were startled and awakened by hearing keys rattling in the door.  The host opened the door to the cottage and mentioned she sent an email, however it was only sent about an hour and a half prior to their arrival and I was still sleeping therefore I never read the email.
Although I thoroughly loved the cottage, I'm a bit concerned by the host's lack of consideration for me as a guest by wanting to have movers come while I'm there and also unexpectedly stopping by.  I highly doubt the cottage is rented every day, therefore I don't understand the urgency of trying to have movers in the cottage while I was staying there. Additionally, when she came by unannounced, she could have at least knocked on the door as opposed to just unlocking it w/ her keys. It was an alarming experience to wake up to the door opening, not knowing who was there. Had it not been for those experiences, I would give this place 5 stars, but unfortunately those two incidents really tainted my experience.  "
3821616,65797596,2016-03-17,12292021,Emma,"Very cute cottage we hoped for, had everything we needed for our short stay with our toddler, and good location for walking to coast, shops and restaurants.  Would definitely recommend."
3821616,66148158,2016-03-20,13780459,Josh,Alka was a great host and the cottage was perfect for our short stay in Pacific Grove. Would definitely stay here again.
3821616,66748403,2016-03-24,12967151,Rebecca,"We loved our short stay at Alka's light, bright & cheery cottage. The space was so clean & fresh and perfect for our family of four and our teen girls enjoyed sleeping on the new daybeds in the living area.

This was our first Airbnb stay and Alka was so friendly and proactive about sending us all we needed to know plus fabulous recommendations for places to eat and excursions to consider.  Thanks to her advice we had a delicious breakfast and dinner at the Red House and invited friends to join us for a fun, lively dinner at Peppers.

The little cottage is in the perfect location for exploring beautiful, peaceful Pacific Grove and we found it relaxing and refreshing to stay outside the hustle & bustle of Monterey.  I took gorgeous runs straight from the cottage down to and along the ocean front and highlights of our family trip were a bike ride with friends along the 17 mile drive to/from Pebble Beach and a visit to the Aquarium.

We had few needs during our stay, as everything we expected was provided and when we did have a quick question, Alka was responsive and accommodating.

Staying at the sunny cottage was one of the best choices we made when booking our trip along the California coast and we'd highly recommend to others seeking a quiet getaway."
3821616,66873037,2016-03-25,44086688,Kim,"Very welcoming. The home wasn't clean prior to our arrival, but the host was extremely responsive. Great coffee provided and wonderful location. The MBA tickets were an added plus!"
3821616,67142843,2016-03-27,52187671,Andrew,"We had a fantastic stay at Alka and Josh's cottage. The home was exactly as described in the listing, the directions and recommendations were super helpful and Alka was a responsive and friendly host. Highly recommend this Airbnb for those looking for a quiet, peaceful and relaxing getaway!"
3821616,68104038,2016-04-02,57796185,Susana,"Lovely cottage near Monterey.  Right when you enter the home, you are welcomed by so much natural light.  The cottage was very clean and had a fresh scent.  The living room was a good size with 2 couches that can be used as beds.  The kitchen was a good size ( no room for an eating table so you have to use the counter space to eat).  The bed room has a queen size bed, which was very comfortable ( a little on the noisy side when ever we repositioned ourselves).  I loved the bathroom with its claw foot tub.  I think it can accommodate 4 people maximum without feeling too crowded.  All in all we loved it.  It is pretty close to the neighboring homes, so you do have to be mindful of the noise you make.  Walking distance from the beach and restaurants.  7 minute drive to the aquarium,  which the hosts were kind enough to let us use their guest passes.  10 minutes from Carmel and Pebble Beach.  About an hour to Big Sur.  it really is a great location.  We hope to come back and stay next year...  "
3821616,68326723,2016-04-04,34358944,Amy,"Great place! Clean, convenient and comfortable!"
3821616,68953050,2016-04-08,97891,Heather,"We had a wonderful time in Brad and Alka's cottage.  The cottage was warm, inviting and spotlessly cleaned/ maintained. We absolutely loved the location- as it was right downtown but quiet. We were fortunate to meet the woman cleaning the cottage and she gave us some tips on things to do while we were in town. Alka and Brad were also in PG that week and checked in via text to make sure all was well. I knew if there were any problems (which there weren't!) they would be easy to reach. 

It was the perfect size for a couple and a baby- the pack&play fit easily in the bedroom. PG is also such a family friendly town- we couldn't have had a more relaxing vacation. 

We would love to come back and plan to recommend it to family. "
3821616,69952007,2016-04-15,52338436,Kim,The Bright Beach Cottage was indeed a bright beach cottage.  Very very cute and in a great location.  I walked to Asilomar every day. Downtown Pacific Grove and Lovers Point were just down the street.  The house was clean and comfortable and access and arrangements were effortless.  I can't wait to return next year.  
3821616,70227168,2016-04-17,3197394,Derrick,Alka was an amazing host and was extremely communicative through the whole process. The Airbnb was exactly as advertised and my girlfriend and I loved it. We would definitely stay at Alka's again!

This cottage is a perfect home base for visiting the Monterey peninsula and surrounding areas. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a homey, quiet, and private place to stay. 

It was the perfect home base for running the Big Sur Marathon and then recovering!

3821616,72592614,2016-05-03,18465412,Kerstin,"We had a great time staying in that sweet little cottage! You can go everywhere on foot, parking was no problem and it really is a great neighbourhood. We rented bikes down at Lover's Point, enjoyed the aquarium with the free passes and had breakfast and dinner at the Red House Cafe. We were also in luck to visit the farmers market and had some delicious fresh pizza. There is a small supermarket just one block away and a Trader Joe's just a short drive up the road. So everything you need is (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was real easy. Thank you Alka!"
3821616,72947096,2016-05-05,13594140,Li,"A very lovely cottage! The location is convenient, everything is nice and clean. I would highly recommend it to everyone who is visiting the area."

The cottage is very cozy, well equipped and located in a great part of town. We were pretty much within easy walking distance of everything in PG and Monterey. It was very nice to have the Aquarium tickets too - that was an added bonus."

We will definitely stay here again. Alka was nearly instantaneous regarding questions we had and this cottage is one short block for the cutest part of Pacific Grove. We fell in love with this little beach town…"
3821616,76727274,2016-05-29,16777348,Ederlyn,"We had a wonderful time at the cottage. It was very clean and organized. Just the right size for a family of four. The only stressful part for us is making sure the kids were not making too much noise so that we don't disturb the neighbors (we have two toddlers, a 3 and a 20 month old) the proximity to the Monterey bay aquarium plus the passes were great. We walked the beach trail and it was a short and enjoyable one (20-30 min depending on our pace and how much we stop and take pics!) the kids love getting out of the stroller and just running around or watching the waves or the seals. They absolutely love the aquarium too! We would go there when it opens then go home, take a nap then come back at an hour before closing(not busy at all). We then explored cannary row and had dinner there. Alka was very prompt in replying when I had questions for her, great host! We also saved some money by buying some food supplies at the nearby (have to drive though) trader joes. I suggest hiking point Lobos as well since it's so close and beautiful. We would definitely come back to Monterey and hopefully stay at the cottage again! Thanks! "
3821616,77094500,2016-05-30,28133843,Jaslyn,"We loved our stay. Alka was super communicative and responsive, and the cottage was exactly as described (bright, beachy, charming) and couldn't be better located. We'd love to return!"
3821616,79443524,2016-06-12,4232001,Victoria,"We loved everything about our stay in Pacific Grove ... perfect location, super clean and comfy cottage, and terrific weather! We love to cook, so put the kitchen to good use daily, and enjoyed having such a light and bright place to relax. The bed is comfy, the sofas are great for stretching out to read, the bathroom is immaculate, and there are lots of wonderful homey touches everywhere.

It's an easy 20 to 30 minute walk to the aquarium (only a mile), and there's lots to do near the house ... coffee and treats at the The Bookworks (2 minute walk), several thrift and 2nd hand stores, antique stores, the lighthouse, and much more. Fabulous Victorian architecture everywhere you look :-)  And we found some great estate and garage sales on Saturday.

If you like to hike, be sure to visit Point Lobos ... easy accessible trails, and some of the prettiest scenery on the entire Pacific Coast. Great for photography, with lots of wildlife year-round.  The tide pools are wonderful for exploring, and hiking above the many coves is absolutely beautiful ... we saw seal pups with their mothers, lots of otters, and at least a dozen types of seabirds, including nesting cormorants. We never miss it when we're in town ... take water and a picnic lunch, and spend the day!

Many thanks to Alka and Brad, we're looking forward to coming back when you have an opening."
3821616,80334929,2016-06-17,9256778,(Email hidden by Airbnb),"A beautiful 4 night stay in this exquisite cottage. Alka and Brad were always accessible, and reached out to me early on to make sure I had everything I needed (I did). The cottage, as comfortable as it is lovely, is filled with natural light during the day, and there is abundant indoor lighting after dark. The overall space is not large, but designed and decorated in such as way that it seems very spacious. The pictures convey it well - it's an aesthetic pleasure just to be in this space. A wonderful location, from which you can easily walk to restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and shops, as well as to stunning Monterey Bay itself. By all means use the guest passes to the extraordinary Aquarium, which is also within walking distance. Despite the proximity of the cottage to the houses on either side, I was never disturbed by noise, and slept well in the comfortable bed. Thank you, Alka and Brad, for such an enjoyable stay! "
3821616,81036800,2016-06-20,9069553,Thomas,"Alka and Brad were excellent hosts. We really appreciated all of the clear communication before our stay. Alka is very friendly and even stopped by one evening to say hello. 

The cottage is very comfortable and within walking distance of everything in Pacific Grove. It's a short drive to the aquarium and a short walk to beach. 

Coffee and fixins were provided, but we ended up just walking down the block for coffee in the morning. 

We enjoyed our stay and would recommend staying with Alka and Brad."
3821616,81533577,2016-06-23,59527016,Aly,Alka and Brad truly are super hosts. We stayed at their cottage in Monterey. The home was clean and had everything you needed. It was located close enough to the beach and the aquarium that we were able to walk everywhere. Our family felt like we were at home when staying at their place. We also loved that they provided aquarium passes. Alka was quick to respond when we needed her. We would definitely stay here again! 
3821616,82627236,2016-06-28,1350314,Chris,"Alka and Brad were great hosts, and let us have lots of information on places to go and on local wineries that I had asked about.

The cottage is beautiful with such a bright aspect and so comfortable and well equipped, we loved it there. It was a perfect size for the 2 of us. The street is quiet very attractive, and very close to the coast

Pacific Grove is a lovely place to stay it is quiet and has various restaurants and beautiful coastline. it is very close to the 17 Mile Drive, which is spectacular, and Monterey and Carmel, both of which are great places to visit. 

We really enjoyed our walk at Point Lobos , just off Route 1, towards Big Sur, it had amazing coastal features and wildlife and is a must for any visit

Thank you Alka and Brad for a perfect stay"
3821616,84781535,2016-07-09,6788271,Kali,"This charming, well-designed cottage was absolutely ideal for our family of 4. We wanted a cozy seaside getaway and that's exactly what we got- Alka made sure we had everything we needed to have that. Great recommendations for food, 2 tickets to the Aquarium (saved us a bundle!), extra blankets and bedding for our kids on the comfortable daybeds. All in all, a lovely experience!"

The cottage was very convenient to everything we wanted to do. The aquarium and Cannery Row was so much fun. Lover's Point was a great place for the kids to play in the water and search for shells.

We recommend staying here to anyone visiting Monterey!"
3821616,88901006,2016-07-25,50426644,Natalie,"The cottage was lovely and perfectly positioned.  Walking distance to almost everything!  The cottage is small, but has everything you need.  And is in a lovely quiet area, We had a 8yo visit us for a couple of days and she loved the upstairs loft bedroom!
The aquarium was fantastic.  We drove down which was a bit tricky for parking (it was a Sat on summer holidays though!), so I'd probably recommend catching a bus.
 We had a lovely, lovely time!"
3821616,89721581,2016-07-29,9532576,Khoi-Anh,"We had a great stay. The cottage is charming, cozy, bright, pristine clean. Our sons loved the mezzanine. Location is perfect, a 1mn walk to great restaurants and lovely streets, and also walking distance to Lovers point. The Aquarium tickets are a great touch. Overall, the walk to there along the coast and the visit made for a wonderful afternoon. More generally, there is a very nice coastal bike lane from the Aquarium to the 7mile road,  which we enjoyed - great seaviews and beaches all the way. Alka was very responsive to all our emails which was also great. All in all, we warmly recommend."

It's just a few houses down from Lighthouse, which is where all the shops and cafes are.  We were able to walk to get coffee every morning.  We walked to Lover's Point for the Feast of the Lanterns. 

The parking was a little difficult at times.  It's street parking only.  But even during this busy weekend, we were always able to park somewhere on the block. 

The cottage itself is beautiful.  It's VERY light and full of sunshine (quite a big deal in a city that can be foggy and drizzly for weeks at a time)!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
3821616,92178000,2016-08-07,60065219,Tristan,Very warm and friendly; very communicative. Great job with local food and sight recommendations. 
3821616,92762662,2016-08-10,3969136,Andrew,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Bright Beach Cottage. The space is very clean and light-filled; perfect for relaxing. Check-in was easy and all communications were great. 

We took advantage of the Aquarium passes and spent a great day exploring there. We also appreciated the recommendations for dining spots in the neighborhood; so many great places to try and all within easy walking distance. 

In fact, we didn't even move our car the entire stay. We walked everywhere and found Pacific Grove to be a charming town. The surrounding coastline is a must see as well. 

We hope to return to this PG cottage again when our travels bring us through the area. Definitely recommended for both location and comfort. A great getaway weekend!

Thanks Alka for sharing your delightful cottage!"
3821616,93146296,2016-08-11,33091347,Jamie,A great place in a great location. The Res House Cafe is a must and the recommendations were all top rate. 
3821616,94012593,2016-08-14,10848834,Pascale,"Nous avons beaucoup apprecié la petite maison qui est à l'image de celles du quartier, petite et mignonne, très fonctionnelle, très claire et joliment aménagée. Elle est au milieu d'un quartier très agréable, tranquille de pacific grove, à 30 secondes de la rue commercante où l'on trouve de bons restaurants, tres sympas, et à 10 minutes (à peine) à pied de la mer. La ville de monterey, attenante, avec l'aquarium est à 5 minutes en voiture. Les 2 pass offerts pour sa visite sont tres appreciables et font faire une économie d'environ 100$.
La maison elle-même est très agréable, très propre, fonctionnelle et bien équipée. Une chambre séparée, deux petits canapés dans le salon conviennent très bien pour des enfants ( 10 et 13 ans), sans doute un peu juste pour des plus grands. La maison est tres lumineuse et claire, sans volets. Donc prevoir des masques si vous preferez dormir dans le noir. 
Alka est tres prevoyante et tres agreable et il a été très facile de communiquer avec elle. On sent qu'elle a un vrai souci de ses locataires. 
Maison chaudement recommandée, Pacific Grove étant une très bonne étape sur la Highway 1!"
3821616,97059772,2016-08-25,25046397,Tom,"My wife and I stayed a week at the Bright Beach Cottage.  We loved the place.  It is very clean, well appointed, comfy bed, and an easy walk to so many things to do and see in the Pacific Grove and Monterey area.
We walked to restaurants, the beach, the aquarium, and more.  The little cottage gave us privacy while still being close to the center of town activities.  While we didn't really cook during our stay, the kitchen had everything needed to prepare entire meals.  The hosts had recommendations for restaurants and coffee shops, which was helpful. 
Pacific Grove is a cute town, and the cottage is the place to stay!"
3821616,97838543,2016-08-28,4829508,Heather,Perfect location. Bright and airy cottage right in the heart of PG. Alka responded quickly to any emails. Cottage was well equipped and perfect for a few days! 
3821616,98799304,2016-09-01,5563652,Marc,"We had such a great experience with Alka and Brad and of course the great cottage! They went out of their way to make everything so easy. The property itself was very clean and organized and perfect in terms of charm and our style. Also it was so centrally located to all the adventures we had. Would definitely recommend!
"
3821616,99773932,2016-09-05,54932297,Lesley,"Great place to stay.  Super clean and a really nice size.  Much better than being in a cramped hotel room. Nice area, although parking is a bit of an issue and you may have to leave your car a block or 2 away but it's all quite safe. Well appointed. Within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. Lovely quiet neighbourhood. Passes to the aquarium were very well received. Thanks Alka for a great base to have in the area. "
3821616,101346787,2016-09-12,5974641,Rose,"We had a whale of a time at Alka and Brad's beautiful cottage. It was the perfect location to explore the coast along Highway One. We stayed for a week and spent a day whale watching - we saw a blue whale! We walked to Asimolar Beach from Pacific Grove, drove to Carmel a must as it is so beautiful, did Highway One down to McWay Falls to the South and Santa Cruz to the North. We took advantage of the free aquarium passes which was well worth a visit! We also saw the Sea Otters at Moss Landing - the cutest animal ever. 5 minutes walk from the cottage was Lovers Point with a pretty beach. We ate at the Redhouse Cafe for breakfast and dinner - a lovely cosy place with good food. We also dined at the Beachhouse at Lovers Point which had lovely views across the bay. I would highly recommend this cottage."
3821616,102121077,2016-09-16,48271027,Jeffrey,"The property is as described in the advert. It is a very comfortable, well equipped property. There is a grocery supermarket just a few minutes walk away, together with other shops and restaurants. The location is in a quiet residential street. It is ideal for exploring the area, as whale watching boat trips are just a five minute drive away, and the famous 17 mile drive to Carmel is close by. A nice touch was the provision of a pass for the Aquarium."
3821616,102917881,2016-09-19,32225866,Julien,"Our host Alka was exceedingly helpful and prompt in her responses. The cottage is darling, and we had a wonderful time staying there. Pacific Grove was at its finest -- weather wise -- and it is just a lovely place to relax. I slept in the bed in the living room and it was extremely comfortable. My friends shared the bed in the bedroom and they slept very well. We didn't ""cook,"" per se; we did make coffee each morning. Our host left us a pound of great coffee which was so thoughtful. I think the cottage is perfect for a couple -- a young couple. Since we were attending the Monterey Jazz Festival, we got home late each night, and unfortunately we never found parking within a block of the cottage on any evening.  (There is no dedicated driveway.) We did find much closer parking during the day when we arrived and when we checked out. "
3821616,104224916,2016-09-25,2960382,Lauren,"This beach cottage was everything we hoped for - clean, bright, charming, functional. Just a short walk from restaurants, the beach, and lover's point, we couldn't have asked for more. It was our first time in Pacific Grove and the town and the cottage immediately won us over. Alka was helpful and quick to respond to texts. It was the perfect weekend away. Thank you Alka & Brad! We would be thrilled to stay again in the future. Jeremy & Lauren"
3821616,104816302,2016-09-28,36221590,Geralyn,Alka really went the extra mile to accommodate us and make us comfortable and I really appreciate that. Had a great stay in Monterey on a California coastal road trip! Thanks Alka! Geralyn 
3821616,105715157,2016-10-02,6171012,Gil,"Alka was very accommodating to us.  We were running late and way past our check in time; she was more than understanding and worked with us. Being that we arrived after dark we didn't get to explore the first night, but were pleasantly surprised that a walk down the street leads you to a charming street of shops, galleries, and restaurants. We will definitely visit again. "
3821616,106349467,2016-10-05,51904025,Timothy,Alka was very detailed in her description of the area and different activities to engage in. The location was perfect and within easy reach of nearly everything. Would highly recommend this experience.
3821616,107229031,2016-10-09,553712,Noah,"This is probably one of the best Airbnb's I have stayed in. It is in the perfect location, it makes you feel like you are a local. It is very bright and welcoming, with all of the necessities needed. My family and I enjoyed walking to the aquarium and using the supplied guest passes. There's so much to do in this little town, as it is filled with beautiful sites and amazing restaurants. We highly recommend going to ""The Red House"" for breakfast and having the crabcake egg Benedict. My wife and I are already planning a return visit to this amazing cottage. "
3821616,107815964,2016-10-12,36115131,Claire,We wish we could move in forever!  From the ease of booking and welcome from Alka to arrival it was a breeze.  But the best part was opening the door for the first time knowing you get to stay there!  We loved it!
3821616,108119921,2016-10-14,88331578,Brian,"Sunny and clean cottage in a great location. We enjoyed spending a couple of days wandering around Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel."
3821616,108923691,2016-10-18,79381014,Derrick,"This place was exactly what we were looking for.  It is within walking distance to the beach and multiple restaurants and amenities.  The place was very clean and had everything we needed.  I stayed in contact with the Alka during the stay and everything worked out perfect.
Things I would suggest to person renting in Pacific Grove:
-rent bikes for the week
-set up a golf tee time
-drive the 17 mile drive
-explore the towns and do be afraid to get lost, we found lots of cute shops all around the towns because we just wanted to get lost.  "
3821616,109152170,2016-10-19,24088243,Lisa,"This cute and cozy cottage in beautiful Pacific Grove was the perfect place for our first vacation with our 5-month old. The cottage was plenty big enough for a baby that isn't mobile yet, and our travel crib easily fit in the bedroom. The hosts are superb communicators. We almost had a hiccup with the reservation but it was cleared up quickly without any issues. The location of the cottage was exactly what we were hoping for! We parked the car and didn't get back in it until we left!! We were able to walk everywhere--the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the butterfly sanctuary, Lovers Point, the farmers' market (on Mondays), and a variety of restaurants. We love Pacific Grove and we can't wait to go back. "
3821616,109634244,2016-10-22,431395,Phillip,"We unfortunately weren't able to stay at the cottage because our son came down with something the night before we were supposed to leave. Alka was very understanding and worked with us as we over the course of a few nights tried to figure out if we could make it or not! I'm sure the cottage is nice and we hope to find out later when we can schedule another trip, but I can certainly give Alka a five star review for being a professional host even when things don't go as planned."
3821616,110352193,2016-10-25,59714919,Shad,Great location in a beautiful city. 
3821616,110813116,2016-10-28,8872035,Stephanie,"This was the perfect location for a test getaway with our infant! There is so much within walking distance of Alka's cottage from Lover's Point and numerous restaurants to the renown Monterey Aquarium which allowed us to easily work around our son's nap times and still see various attractions. Every restaurant allowed us to do take-out for less stressful meals in the cottage.  Having the aquarium tickets included ($100 value) was a bonus as our son lasted less than 20 minutes there each visit. The cottage itself is cozy, clean, and bright. "
3821616,111266643,2016-10-30,36554671,Darla,"Cute cottage in a quiet neighborhood. Perfect for a couple!  Alka was friendly and easy to communicate with.  Nice little extras in the house (thanks for the coffee and milk!). Clean, IKEA aesthetic, the pictures are accurate. No dining area (we like to play games so a regular table would have been nice) but the bar worked fine for a quick snack and computer work.  Nice living area for lounging or taking a nap, and lots of light and fresh air from the many windows. "
3821616,112186471,2016-11-04,25170386,Elizabeth,"The cottage is beautifully decorated, inviting, colorful and cozy. The light streaming in made it a wonderful spot to rest and relax. Nearby shops, walks, and the beautiful coast made my stay unforgettable. "
3821616,112621758,2016-11-06,70435544,Jason,"Beautiful, sunny cottage with tall vaulted ceilings and cozy modern decor. The aquarium tickets and restaurant recommendations were a great added touch. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice weekend getaway in Monterey."
3821616,113792541,2016-11-13,27362300,Julie,"All the communication with Alka was warm, friendly, prompt and responsive to our needs. The place is really wonderful: attractive, comfortable and full of character in a stellar location. It's also amazingly quiet, allowing for deep sleep and undisturbed nights. Alka thought of everything in providing guest amenities and the Aquarium passes are certainly a plus. We will be back. "
3821616,114327510,2016-11-17,21084111,Shannon,"Lovely cottage in a wonderful location - close to restaurants, shops, and attractions. Definitely worth the stay just to go to Pavel's bakery! Communication was quick and easy with the host. A good spot to check out PCH drive, Carmel and Monterrey. The passes to the aquarium were really useful and worth a visit. Highly recommend! "
3821616,114888317,2016-11-20,7337684,Jenny,"Alka was such a great host, very responsive! The cottage was adorable and had everything we needed. Plus the location was so close to everything (cafes, bakeries, hikes, beach)! Last minute we wanted to add a day to our trip and Alka was able to accommodate us. "
3821616,116058453,2016-11-27,22214727,Stephanie,"The cottage was so perfect for our stay! We were able to walk down to the ocean and around town every day. I even walked to the aquarium as well which is 1 mile away, it's along the ocean front and if you like to walk it's great! The cottage was stocked with everything we needed, we enjoy going to the local Trader Joe's and making dinners ""at home"" for the most part. It was very spacious for 2 people, and very quiet. If you want a relaxing weekend this is the place. We definitely will be back!   "
3821616,117089914,2016-12-04,35416884,Becca,"This place is cute, comfy, and perfectly located. Alka's recommendations were spot on (we went to PassionFish and The Red House Cafe). My boyfriend and I really loved being able to walk everywhere, especially enjoying that the water was 2 blocks away. Check-in / Check-out was super easy. "
3821616,120791508,2016-12-11,12242989,Peteris,"My girlfriend and I escaped to this cottage for an amazing weekend. I think it really struck us how incredibly convenient the location of the cottage was. The main shops/restaurants in Pacific Grove were only a 2 minute walk away and we were able to easily walk to the water and aquarium. 

The cottage itself was great as well. We cooked most of our meals and we had everything that we needed to create some delicious meals.

Lastly, Alka was a great host and gave us some very good recommendations- particularly on the best local bakeries. Would definitely recommend this cottage to others!"
3821616,121914800,2016-12-19,82588017,Gloria,It was easy to communicate with Alka. The place was nice and comfortable with everything we needed. The neighborhood was nice and quiet:) 
3821616,122925924,2016-12-26,80145234,Calli,"A lovely, cozy cottage stay over Christmas. We enjoyed the aquarium passes and the convenience of being close to town. Traveling with a toddler can be difficult but Alka and Brad were so great and made sure everything was perfect! "

3821616,123765868,2016-12-30,67554926,Ariel D,We had a lovely time in the cottage and even more during our stay in Pacific Grove. Carmel and Monterrey are just a few mins away and we absolutely loved it. Thanks for being great hosts and for the passes to the aquarium. Our son loved it.  Communication was always great too. Thanks! 
3821616,124381042,2017-01-01,8712388,Jason,Lovely little cottage in a really nice spot. Strongly recommended.

3821616,127057993,2017-01-15,55178439,Jennifer,"What a wonderful place in pacific grove! We walked to everything- lovers point, asilomar beach, Monterey aquarium(free passes from alka), restaurants and shops!!!! Carmel beach and big sur are short drives away!!! 5 stars for everything! "
3821616,127366627,2017-01-17,73434625,Sarah,"Alka's cottage was perfect for my mom and I on our weekend getaway. We walked to many restaurants in Pacific Grove (all of Alka's suggestions were spot on!). Such a cute little town and a perfect home base for exploring the coast. Very safe and quiet, would be perfect for a solo traveler or a small family! Thanks again for an awesome stay! "
3821616,127738096,2017-01-20,23131791,Coleen,"Great spot for my personal retreat.  Comfortable, quiet, walking distance to the ocean, and 1/2 block from restaurants and shops.  Enjoy!"

Walking distance to lots of beautiful shops, restaurants and the stunning coastline. We stayed with our 3yd old and 3 month old and it was great. The cottage had everything we needed for our mini vacation. We'd love to come back! "
3821616,128946090,2017-01-28,105408128,Hong,"还不错,很安静的住处"
3821616,129432373,2017-01-30,62025267,Monique,Location was perfect! The cottage was a great size for my husband and I and our two children who are under the age of 6. The cottage is located on a very very quiet one way street I'm pretty sure my children were a bit too loud (they are 5 and 2 and love playing pirates and roaring like dinosaurs) the cottage was also close to a lot of restaurants and in walking distance to the beach and the monarch sanctuary. We went to Monterey to celebrate our sons 5th birthday and took him to the aquarium with the guest passes Alka provided. He LOVED it! He didn't want to leave he also said he loved the cottage. Our stay was great. Very happy. 
3821616,129958166,2017-02-03,21258254,Linh,"Alka and Brad's sweet little cottage was exactly what my small family of 4 needed for a mini getaway. Close to the main shops in Pacific Grove, within walking distance to the park and to Lover's Point, and with plenty of parking, we had a lovely time. My 4 year old especially loved waking up the sounds of seagulls squawking. Thank you again Alka!"
3821616,131123706,2017-02-10,109118625,Jennifer,"Absolutely wonderful, cozy little place. It was easy to get to my office in Monterey, but it was also easy to get to all the fun restaurants in Pacific Grove. Parking on the street was a little bit limited, but it was easy to find a spot no more than a block away from the house. The bed was extremely comfortable, the kitchen was equipped to be able to cook, and the hosts were so helpful and accommodating. The weather was really rainy while I was in Pacific Grove, and Alka even reached out to me and asked if I needed to borrow an umbrella. I could not recommend this place more highly--I'll definitely try to stay here again when I come back!"
3821616,132647636,2017-02-18,29784983,Rob,"Alka's cottage is an authentic slice of Pacific Grove history...small, charming, part of a turn of the century neighborhood on a street filled with other similar cottages. The inside is bright and clean with a fully equipped
kitchen. The location is the major plus being near several great restaurants, and coffee shops. Walkable to
the movie theater and of course the gorgeous ocean area. The aquarium tix came in handy on a rainy day!"
3821616,133183156,2017-02-20,15772183,Susie,"Fantastic place! Excellent layout which makes it cozy but airy and bright. Clean and had everything we could possibly need - towels, extra blankets, shampoo and soap, Kleenex!  Great location half a block to the main street with wonderful restaurants and shops. Will definitely stay here again if we're in the area. "
3821616,133771627,2017-02-24,105624583,Jonathan,Alka's cottage has the perfect location in Pacific Grove. Within a 2 min walk you have everything you could need and a beautiful 20min walk takes you to Monterey and the aquarium (the fact that complimentary aquarium tickets are waiting for you in the cottage is a really nice touch). Great communication throughout.
3821616,134292899,2017-02-26,109926781,Erika,We had a fantastic time mainly because of the ideal location of this beautiful little cottage as well as its homie clean feel! Alka's prompt communication made it even better! Highly highly recommend!!
3821616,135016549,2017-03-02,112005680,Whitney,My husband and I celebrated our 1st anniversary here with our 8 month old son. It was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do. The cottage is adorable and pefect size for a small family. We felt right at home. It was very clean and comfortable and we will definitely coming back! 
3821616,136448728,2017-03-10,75912413,Stephanie,Alka was very communicative and helpful.  The property was exactly as advertised. Great for exploring the Monterey Peninsula. 
3821616,136983635,2017-03-12,2338774,Sarah,Wonderful place that is close to everything. No need to drive anywhere!

3821616,138648831,2017-03-20,52839678,Heng Y Janice,"The place a cute, cozy and comfy cottage. It has everything I needed for a weekend trip. Everything in the house is well placed and labeled. The host also provided us two aquriam tickets which saved us some money. I'll highly recommend this place if you are visiting Carmel, PG, Monterey area."
3821616,140555851,2017-03-30,29066205,Jan,This is the perfect place to stay in PG. The cottage is bright and cheerful. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was delightful to make our breakfast and lunch. The location was ideal for walking to the bay and Lover's Point. We also walked for groceries and coffee and dining out . Our granddaughter loved the garden path around the house. It was like a secret garden. We highly recommend staying at Alka and Brad's cottage.
3821616,141761119,2017-04-04,4350836,Svea Lin,"This place was perfect for us! We loved the light and airy comfort of the living room and kitchen, equipped with everything we needed (and more!) Our 4-year old was very happy with the large ""project"" table and comfortable living room couches. Excellent for lounging after big adventures to the aquarium. Closely situated cabin-like homes (most with beautiful gardens) gave the neighborhood a very friendly, small-town vibe. We ate excellent Thai around the corner, and visited the Juicery and Pavel's Bakerei a block over. An unexpected bonus was walking back from the aquarium and sighting several old churches (and other historic buildings) with the beautiful bay back drop. It felt like a serene coastal town in Europe, alas, in my home state. We will definitely be back!"
3821616,142323612,2017-04-07,122719209,Kristin,Great cottage and location! Alka was great with communication. 
3821616,142911661,2017-04-09,63979704,Evan,"My girlfriend and I came up to Monterey for the weekend and we had such a great time!  The bungalow was on a quiet street, but very close to the main road, which had a ton of food options. It was very easy to walk around and find parking (though there is no designated parking spot).  The house was very clean, bright and airy.  Huge plus- the bed was very comfy to sleep in!  The instructions were very clear and the hosts were super easy to communicate with!  "
3821616,144098593,2017-04-14,109846905,Janet,Loved the quant little spot in an area that is loaded with educational points of interest as well as beautiful sites. The  flowers and lemon tree in the yard make the relaxing moments so enjoyable.

3821616,145735541,2017-04-19,645184,Arthur,"This place is perfect for a family of 4. Everything is at walking distance including the Monterey aquarium (the two passes included with the house are great, saving us $100). The kids (and parents) had a blast. We will absolutely come back for a long week end!"
3821616,147433538,2017-04-26,1775667,Todd,"Great little, centrally located place to stay in Pacific Grove. Steps from restaurants and bars and a shot walk to Lover's point. 

Nice place to stay for a weekend on the Monterey Peninsula. "
3821616,148870999,2017-05-01,9806319,Blake,Another amazing stay at this listing. The place is beautifully decorated and in an ideal location. It made for a very special trip. Alka is a very attentive and hospitable host. Thank you!
3821616,149497808,2017-05-04,17937230,Shawn,"Alka's place is an ideal apartment for love birds, visitors, and professionals traveling on business. It's fully equipped with everything you need for a comfortable and pleasant stay. Alka has gone out of her way to make us feel special and appreciated guests. Her charming seaside bungalow is reasonably priced and offers excellent value for the money. The two free passes to the aquarium would cost about $100, so you need to consider that when you look at the total value offering. The prime location makes this bungalow a unique accommodation for those who prefer privacy while being close to everything Monterey has to offer. "
3821616,150641249,2017-05-08,119812150,Erek,"Exactly as advertised. Bright and clean, close to the beach and great local spots. Completely satisfied!"
3821616,151188101,2017-05-11,17656596,Jeanne,"This is a wonderful cottage for either a girl's or a couple's getaway. It is well situated, with many terrific restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood is very nice and the neighbors we encountered were very friendly. 

The cottage was well stocked with everything needed to prepare meals. In addition, the home was immaculate. 

We appreciated having the use of the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes. That $100 savings makes staying in this cottage a pretty good deal, if you're planning to go to the aquarium during your stay. 

"
3821616,153270290,2017-05-20,11939181,Richard,"Alka's place is a charming and well-appointed lodging, located within easy walking distance to anything in Pacific Grove. This clean, cheerful little house, originally built in the early 20th-century, is modernized to create a bright and surprisingly spacious space in a quiet historic neighborhood. A truly nice getaway for a quiet rest from the busy Monterey Peninsula. "
3821616,154086745,2017-05-22,45026899,Danna,The space was conveniently located and cozy. The light that floods into the main room in the afternoon made reading and drinking wine a dream. Great little get away space.
3821616,154471866,2017-05-24,61374414,Meghan,"Alma's cottage is a peaceful and beautiful getaway in Pacific Grove. We enjoyed our stay in the bright, colorful, peaceful, and organized house. The french press coffee and passes to enjoy Monterey Bay Aquarium were above and beyond! I highly recommend her place! "
3821616,154948635,2017-05-26,33943279,Greg,"Very comfortable, easy walk to the beach and restaurants. The Aquarium Tickets were great. We will stay there again. "
3821616,156198781,2017-05-29,79540219,Zhuowen,"nice little cottage close to the beach, restaurants, and shops. We had a great stay there! "
3821616,156724485,2017-05-31,35775443,Ed,"We enjoyed our short stay in Monterey/Pacific Grove. The cottage was everything we expected and very close to food, the aquarium, etc. Alka was very responsive and we encountered no issues during our stay. Thanks! "
3821616,157816345,2017-06-04,74679925,Heather,"Very clean, super quiet home.  Enjoyed the aquarium as a recovery to an exhausting race the day before.  It was great being able to leave the car and walk to everything we wanted to see and do.  It felt like a safe area and we were very comfortable.  Alka was great at communicating and answering all our questions.  "
3821616,159744705,2017-06-11,1778190,Alex & Jamie,"Lovely cute little cottage in a fantastic location. Loved exploring the area and having somewhere comfortable to come back to was great. Our only criticism would be that the shower was quite weak, but overall not a massive issue. Aquarium passes were a real bonus and was great fun. Pacific Grove is a lovely area to stay. "
3821616,162373753,2017-06-20,75247501,Sujean,"Location, location, location! My husband and I stayed with our 2-year-old and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The location was fantastic and we ended up walking to restaurants and the aquarium (with a stroller).  Alka provided us with detailed recommendations and descriptions for nearby restaurants, and they were all spot on.  The cottage had everything we needed for our two night stay (towels, shampoo, shower gel, wifi, coffee maker + coffee and lots of dishes and pots and pans). We found parking across the street from the cottage pretty easily as well. We will definitely be back!"
3821616,163454014,2017-06-24,96500112,Marina,This place is wonderful! Very clean and airy. We loved how close it was to restaurants and shops. It was about a 20 minute walk to the Monterey Aquarium. Would love to stay here again the host was so helpful in answering questions and very nice! 
3821616,164288835,2017-06-26,3068889,Kelly,"This review is most applicable for travelers with small children. We, my husband, mother, and I, traveled with our 1.5 year old. All had a great time!

We fit a Phil & Ted's travel crib easily in the bedroom, which got dark enough for our toddler to fall asleep around 8pm in the summer. We used one of the daybeds in the main part of the (adorable) house for sleeping. It was comfortable and easy to convert from a couch to a twin-sized bed. Plenty of dishes at the house for meals, as well as a nice over-sized coffee table. We kept it simple with take out - lots of great options around.

Recommend hitting up the Monterey Aquarium right when they open to beat the crowds. The house is close enough (1 mile) so you can go to the aquarium in the morning, then back to the house for a nap, then return later. We found that it had gotten less busy around 4pm when we returned. 

Easy walk down to Crema for Verve coffee in the morning. Delicious coffee and pastries. "
3821616,164829250,2017-06-29,131840549,Neena,"Cute and cozy cottage. Amazing location!  We were able to walk everywhere, including the aquarium, and didn't get back in the car until we left.   17 mile drive is a must see. Absolutely stunning. We'll be back!"
3821616,165645860,2017-07-01,74558715,Shannon,"Great tiny house close to restaurants, beach, aquarium and Carmel.   "
3821616,167083732,2017-07-05,36856529,Mitchel And Tara,The cottage was cute as can be! The location was the perfect get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. Walking distance to everything Pacific Grove and a nice walk along the water into downtown Monterey as well. 
3821616,168601013,2017-07-09,111850839,Cristy,Absolutely lovely cottage in a fantastic location - we walked almost everywhere. Communication was stellar and everything was just incredibly easy. Would absolutely stay here again! 
3821616,169446965,2017-07-12,123819143,Alison,"Location can't be beat! We loved being able to quickly walk anywhere in Pacific Grove, and even to the Aquarium which is just a mile away-- the included passes were appreciated! The cottage is clean and cozy, and I would say ideal for a couple but absolutely sufficient for our family of 4. Very well appointed and accurately described. We had a wonderful stay!"
3821616,170129432,2017-07-14,178133,Derek,An awesome place to stay. Even better in person than the terrific pictures already shown on Airbnb. The two free Aquarium tickets were great value for the stay. Also centrally located to everything Monterrey. Red House cookies were totally worth it too!
3821616,171146036,2017-07-16,138961630,Paula,"GREAT place to stay.  So cute, charming,  clean.  Great touches with coffee and milk for early morning risers!"
3821616,172064986,2017-07-19,4346266,Vivian,"Alka' cottage was cute, sweet n simply lovely! The cottage match its photos, bright with lots of natural light. Even though it wasn't a big space, it felt bigger with all the natural light and high ceiling in living n kitchen area. The cottage was clean and it suits our family of 4 (albeit my two little ones are 3yo n 3week old) but we were plenty happy with the space. She provided plenty of linens like towels extra sheets n blankets for us as well which was nice. Location of the cottage is great since it's blocks away from Lovers Point park/beach of Pacific Grove and you're only about 5min drive away from Cannery Row n Aquarium so we loved it. Parking was generally not an issue for us as we got back to the cottage usually before 8pm however for those late owls who get back later then you might have more trouble finding street parking. Alka was overall easy to communicate with n she left easy directions for checking in and out of the cottage. She also always reply promptly which I appreciates. Lastly we were grateful for the aquarium passes which allowed us to spend 2 almost full days there. My eldest daughter loved it! Thank you for helping our family create some wonderful memory! We would definitely return next time! "
3821616,172714234,2017-07-21,7704738,Rachel,"Beautiful little space--a very short walk to the gorgeous park/beach, lots of great little food options nearby, and the aquarium passes are a great perk. Perfect for a relaxing getaway."
3821616,174115265,2017-07-24,18466952,Cathie,"Alka's clean, bright, well-equipped, and comfortable cottage is within walking distance of everything in Pacific Grove (great restaurants, shops, the aquarium, lighthouse, Asilomar Beach...) yet tucked away on a private, quiet street. We found free, long term parking right on the street and never needed our car. A cheerful, cozy place we hope to return to!"
3821616,174699032,2017-07-26,110739528,Samantha,"Extremely central location, walking distance from shops food and aquarium, but in a very quiet street. House is very clean, bright and welcoming. Alka is an excellent communicator. We enjoyed our stay! Pack conditioner (soap and shampoo provided ;)"
3821616,175356928,2017-07-28,47276561,Josh,Everything was great. I guess my only complaint is the water pressure in the shower. 
3821616,177111799,2017-08-01,21818990,Beth,"We had a wonderful stay in Pacific Grove in Alka's cottage! The cottage is absolutely adorable and perfect for a long weekend on the coast. Great location, very close to restaurants and Lovers Point Park."
3821616,177745517,2017-08-03,72410287,Jeremy,Awesome place to stay! Great location with a nice and easy walk to restaurants/shops and the beach. Would definitely return and highly recommend to others. 
3821616,179081924,2017-08-06,116292,Naomi,"We loved our stay. The cottage was cute and well-appointed, and the neighborhood was fun and convenient."
3821616,180201129,2017-08-09,58789368,Anthony,We had a great time staying here and Alka went out of her way to help us when we needed it. The house is very central to Pacific Grove with all its boutique shops and restaurants. There is also a lovely coastal walk to Cannery Row and the Aquarium along the way we saw a lot of seals lounging and playing on the beach. The bay is teeming with life and you cannot help but look out to sea for bobbing heads and fins.
3821616,182510014,2017-08-14,25954300,Peter & Taelor,"Amazing location for aquarium, Big Sur and Pebble Beach/Carmel. So nice to have the aquarium passes - our baby boy loved it!! "
3821616,183622634,2017-08-17,16844696,Claire,"Alka is a wonderful host - communicative, organised and welcoming. My feeling is that compared to many of the other Air BnBs I have used, the price tag is too high for the quality of the rental. The cottage is in a fantastic location and perfect for the beautiful neighbourhood of Pacific Grove, and also for exploring further afield including Carmel, Big Sur and Santa Cruz. Some small details which I did not enjoy were not being allowed to use the washer/drier facilities in the cottage, and a general feeling of the cottage being a bit run down/budget. There is no headboard on the bed for example, and one of the windows was starting to fall out of its frame. The bathroom is tiny and not very luxurious. For me it felt more in line with a hostel vs a luxury hotel, and I don't think the price reflects this. That said, this is a great place for someone who does not really mind those details and is more interested in the location."
3821616,185411888,2017-08-21,72950837,Diana,We had 4 nights here after 3 in Carmel by the Sea. The area of Pacific Grove is quite historic. We walked to the aquarium via the coastal walk which was lovely. There are a lot of restaurants to choose from. The only fault with the cottage is the tiny bathroom. If you are tall or a larger person it's not the greatest. Everything else was as expected.
3821616,186099447,2017-08-23,60789327,Ursula,"We had THE perfect time in Alka's cozy cottage! We felt at home immediately. It is nicely decorated and perfectly equipped with kitchen utensils, soap etc. And it is perfectly located, we explored the beautiful coast, 17 Mile Drive etc., Big Sur, we really loved it there and would return if we come here again!"
3821616,186880623,2017-08-25,14694421,Nicolas,"Alka and Brad's Bright Beach Cottage is the perfect place to stay to get away for a quiet trip. 

Located just a few steps from great restaurants, but still nestled on a quiet street for ultimate relaxation and privacy."
3821616,188832622,2017-08-30,22007817,Dana,Great communication and exactly as listed!  We had a great stay!
3821616,190249210,2017-09-03,129252772,Gerlinde,"Ausgesprochen nettes Cottage in sehr guter Lage & sehr freundlichen Gastgebern. Gute Restaurants, Cafes und Bäckereien in der Nähe  - alles fußläufig zu erreichen.  Zu Fuß ist man auch gleich am Meer und an der Promenade: Jogging, Spazieren, Radfahren oder Kayak ausborgen. 
Die Gastgeber stellen 2 Member-Tickets für das Aquarium in Monterey zur Verfügung, was einen echten Benefit darstellt, da der Eintritt einiges kostet und man sich für den Ticketkauf nicht mehr anstellen muss. Uns hat's gefallen ;-))"
3821616,191225675,2017-09-06,43407615,Dagmar,Alka's place was lovely - clean and cosy and exactly like pictured. We enjoyed our stay tremendously.
3821616,192998139,2017-09-11,2824248,Kristin,This was a terrific place. Lovely downtown area and saw harbor seals and otters down at Lover's Point Park too. Alka's home was convenient and just what we needed for a quick trip away.
3821616,194968939,2017-09-17,55845193,Ann,"Alka and Brad's place is just as seen on Airbnb, if not better. They were both responsive, flexible and offered great recommendations that made our trip a success. Pacific Heights is a quaint, historic town and completely walkable. So close to Monterey and all it has to offer. We loved the 17 mile bike ride up the coast, live music and wine tasting downtown at night, the Aquarium and Monterey Bay Kayak your with Austin where we saw tons of marine wildlife and mammals up close and personal!!!  We would love to come back!"
3821616,195547175,2017-09-19,97320047,Tracy,"Exactly as advertised; cute little house, well equipped, and walking distance from everything. Alka responded in minutes after texting a question, and reached out later to make sure we were comfortable."
3821616,197769895,2017-09-26,11304831,Garrett,This is a great place to stay in a perfect little part of town. A cute cottage walking distance to dinner and shops. A great find and we highly recomend it.
3821616,198514612,2017-09-29,119143791,Lindsay,"Perfect for a relaxing trip. Cottage was great, location was great. Fabulous escape."
3821616,199724274,2017-10-02,145268510,Elisa,The close stay to downtown made it perfect to come back through the day and rest before enjoying all of Monterey! Everything was beyond our expectations.
3821616,200836000,2017-10-06,141717700,Courtney,"This is the sweetest little cottage in a wonderful location. Once we checked in we were able to leave our car, and walk or bike everywhere we wanted to go for the rest of the trip. Alka made herself readily available in case we needed to get in touch, though there was never a need. Their place is very clean, and comfortable. My fiancé, daughter and I all felt right at home, and enjoyed our trip immensely knowing we had such a lovely spot to go back to."
3821616,202065093,2017-10-09,24901658,Charles,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Alka's house.  She went beyond her call of duty to ensure we had everything we needed as well as provide an excellent list of tourist attractions, restaurants, and cafes.  We would book again with Alka in a heartbeat.  Truly one of my best Airbnb experiences!"
3821616,204166423,2017-10-16,6324972,Alexandra,"Everything was delightful! Alka was so easy to communicate with. The neighborhood is quaint, intimate, charming, and quiet. The cottage was super comfortable and well appointed with everything we needed. We especially enjoyed leisurely walks and exploring Pacific Grove, Carmel, and Monterrey. Still can’t get over how much charm this area of Northern CA has to offer! Thank you for providing such a lovely home-base for our weekend get-away reunion :) We would happily stay here again!"
3821616,206508248,2017-10-25,28198745,Andrea,"Great location, great communication, very nice little beach house!"
3821616,208030826,2017-10-30,21453198,Maren,"The bed is really comfortable, I slept so well!! It just has a nice vibe. The brightness of the pics in the ad is not misleading - this is a cheery place to call home for a few days! I will be back!"
3821616,210484767,2017-11-09,19611313,Isabella,Would recommend for those looking for a quaint charmer in the PG area!
3821616,211692108,2017-11-13,25031315,Charah,"This place is wonderful! 

Pacific Grove is a sleepier town than say, Monterey, yet that’s even more reason to stay here for peace and quiet. 

Monterey is such a quick car ride away that I’d recommend to anyone with an event in either area. 

The cottage is adorable and has everything you could want. The claw foot tub is amazing and was very welcome for a soak after my half marathon. 

The aquarium tickets make the value definitely worth the cost! We went every day all three days because I love sea life and anything aquatic. 

If you’re considering this listing, just stay here. It’s wonderful, the host gives you your space, check in is flawless, location on point, and aquarium tickets take it above and beyond."
3821616,212428118,2017-11-17,155107488,Timothy,"This place really does live up to the photos and description. A delightful little cottage located in a quiet residential street a stone’s throw from some lovely shops and restaurants to in Pacific Grove. The coast is only a 5 - 10 minute walk away, too! The free Monterey Aquarium passes were a real added bonus - a great place. Communication with Alka was dead easy and friendly. Do stay if you have the chance!"
3821616,213891505,2017-11-23,5612237,Angeline,"Alka’s place is located in the historic neighborhood in Pacific Grove , stone throw to the main street , many cafes and restaurant.  It is very nicely renovated 1 bedroom house . The neighborhood is very pretty. It is walking distance to Lovers Point and Monterey Bay Aquarium ( about 1 mile away) . It is very nice , bright and airy , furnished very well , also with well stocked kitchen . Bathroom is compact and clean 
We love staying there and will certainly be back . "

3821616,215271254,2017-11-28,37623385,Jessica,"This spot was so bright and cheery. Lots of natural light and very comfortable and clean. And child friendly. I stayed with my one year old son and his nanny. The location is fantastic. Just a few minutes’ walk to the main street in Pacific Grove with all its shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed the Monday night farmers market. It is also so close to the beach,Lovers’ Point, beautiful walks and hikes, golfing, the Lighthouse and Monterey. We walked to everything. It was a nice bonus that the rental included passes to the aquarium. We highly recommend this lovely little beach cottage."
3821616,220120723,2017-12-20,2730131,Sammy,"This little cottage is the perfect balance of being centrally located for activities in and around the Monterey/Pacific Grove Area and being secluded enough to be peaceful and relaxing. It’s got everything you need.  It was as clean as can be and Alka was always in communication to make sure we had everything we needed. The tix to the aquarium are a major bonus and we definitely made use of them! 

P.s. There’s nothing better than the simple pleasure of waking up in a new place to find that there’s coffee to be brewed to help you get started on your vacation!"
3821616,220300646,2017-12-21,39534500,Michael,Great place!  Steps away from lots of restaurants - we loved Peppers.  Our family had a blast.
3821616,222823648,2017-12-30,47738979,Ellen,Alka's place is wonderful- cozy and clean. The neighborhood is awesome too- close to the water and walkable to good restaurants and cafes. Would stay here again.
3821616,223742302,2018-01-01,8089760,Enrique,Sophisticated and cozy cottage; great place and area. Beautiful walk to the Aquarium from the Cottage and amazing restaurants around. Easy parking. Alka is a great host and communication was excellent.
3821616,225223494,2018-01-05,14589456,Jose,"Alka’s place is great! Beatiful, very cozy, clean and stylish. We loved the location, walking distance to great coffees, shops and the sea. Staying there made our visit the best! Alka and Brad were very nice and helpful."
3821616,230259339,2018-01-27,73274769,Kara,"What a wonderful little cottage this was! It was exactly what we had hoped for & the pictures definitely do it justice. The location was perfect, a very short walk to the downtown & just a few minute drive to Cannery Row. We had no problems or concerns & both owners made sure to check in on us to make sure everything was going smooth & that we didn’t need anything. I reached out a couple times for nearby recommendations & got such a timely response & follow up. We will most definitely be booking with these owners again!"
3821616,230964762,2018-01-29,15015013,Sindy,"Alka was quick to respond and provided us with details of the cottage and the surrounding area in preparation of our arrival. Check-in was a breeze. The cottage was incredibly cute, tidy and tastefully appointed. Traveling with a 1 year old, we were pleasantly surprised to see a pack-n-play available for use. Our older girl loved our stay so much she was upset to leave, making us promise to return. 

Btw, the guest passes for the aquarium was icing on the cake."
3821616,234690414,2018-02-13,6548163,Emily,"This cottage was perfect for us! We were traveling with our toddler, and it was so nice to be in a quiet community close to everything! We could walk to so many places. 

We discovered we had no hot water at one point during our stay so Alka came over and had someone come out and look at it immediately. At first they thought it couldn't be fixed quickly, and she was prepared to move us to another property so we would not be inconvenienced. The issue ended up being resolved and we didn't have to move after all but we appreciated the quick response and back up plan. 

We had a great time staying at this cottage and couldn't have been more pleased with how friendly and attentive Alka was!"

The ocean bike path goes on for miles!Nice sized kitchen, with everything we needed for a few days. Our visit coincided with a cold snap, the heat worked very well. Only issue was the slightly small bathroom. We don’t watch much television, but we missed it during the Olympics."
3821616,240375636,2018-03-04,13024808,Brian,"Alka's cottage was a treat.  It's in a great location, really close to Lover's Point and nice restaurants, and only a mile walk to the Aquarium.  The cottage itself is clean, comfortable and cozy.  Alka was great to communicate with, very accommodating and helpful.  I would certainly stay in the cottage again.  Highly recommended."
3821616,243134296,2018-03-14,57665798,Amanda,"The cottage was in a perfect location that was quiet yet close to the picturesque downtown Pacific Grove, beautiful ocean views, as well as the Monterey Aquarium. The cottage was very cute and comfortable. We enjoyed nearby Passionfish for dinner as well as the Red House for breakfast as suggested by Alka and previous reviews."
3821616,243966964,2018-03-17,34308759,Babs,Fun little spot if you wanna stay near Monterey but wish to avoid the chaos of the touristy areas. We truly enjoyed the peace and quiet and easy walk to shops and the water to watch the surf.
3821616,245316644,2018-03-21,171139111,Tyler,This is a darling little cottage and so convenient to everything we wanted to do! We enjoyed everything about our visit!

3821616,249752310,2018-04-02,4983928,Joyce,Alka was a wonderful host - checking in on us and making sure that all the details were accounted for.  The house is perfectly situated and is only about a 10 minute walk to the coast and a 15 minute walk to the aquarium.  The guest passes were an added bonus enabling us to skip the queue.  Thank you so much Alka!
3821616,250626739,2018-04-05,178357111,Dave,Great location. Great communication.
3821616,252470979,2018-04-10,24599626,Wolfgang,"This is a wonderful place. Very tasteful interior, great location. Communication with hosts is excellent. Five minute nice walk to the ocean. We will definitely try to come back."
3821616,252946610,2018-04-12,5403298,Kelly,"We could not have asked for a better location for our mini getaway!  After picking up some groceries on our way in, we parked the car and were able walk everywhere for the rest of our stay.  Also, we were so grateful that Alka had a Pack N Play available for our 3.5 month old daughter to sleep in.  This place is a great find and we hope to return sometime soon!"
3821616,254119847,2018-04-15,30067619,Lesley,"Cute little cottage with a cute little personality. The place was perfect for our family of four, my kids didn’t want to go home. We felt at ease and absolutely enjoyed the sunlit place. We also appreciate Alka’s hospitality: she made sure everything went smoothly with our check-in, she even checked up on us in the middle of our stay, her instructions were accurate, and left recommendations to do around the area. In fact, my husband can’t say enough about this ideal location.  We felt like a local because we could walk to everything we had planned in Pacific Grove. The only issue we had was the main bed. It was lumpy, rickety and uncomfortable. The beds/sofas in the living room were actually better.  In spite of this, everything else was just perfect though and would definitely stay here again."
3836973,17979313,2014-08-19,19840033,Jason,"Paul was amazingly gracious and easy to work with. He stocked the house with fruit, coffee, and some snacks to help us feel welcome. He was always responsive to any request we had and even brought in a large sofa bed to accommodate our party. Very thoughtful. The house is updated, has wireless, cable TV, and is perfectly located one black from the country club entrance of pebble beach. The backyard is wonderful, too, a great place to relax and sip on your morning cup of coffee. You can't beat it. I would highly recommend Paul's property."
3836973,18273506,2014-08-24,19803616,Jo,"The house worked well for us and our teen daughters, really clean with lovely decor, lots of space, and all the amenities we needed.  Paul and Yvette were welcoming and made sure everything went as planned, which made our first airbnb experience a smooth one, thanks!"
3836973,18360821,2014-08-25,400480,Evelyn,"Paul was really great about communicating and being flexible with our stay. The description of the place met our expectations - the house is really clean, seems quite new, and the garden in back is lovely. The 3 rooms are all good size and accommodated our needs well (4 adults and a 2yo). Paul had just upgraded one of the rooms to have a queen mattress instead of a futon from when we booked, so that was a nice surprise. He also gave some nice suggestions for places to eat and things nearby.

The only thing that might have made the stay a bit easier was if the kitchen were somewhat stocked with the basics. Most AirBnBs I've stayed out have some basic cooking amenities so you can make a meal in a pinch. This wasn't a problem with me since most of us were out all day, but my friend with the kid struggled to get some stuff cooked up quickly. We also noted that at the very least kitchen should have wine glasses and a bottle opener :).

All up, good experience and recommended. It's a typical neighborhood but well located to drive to stuff around and our stay was comfortable."
3836973,18904070,2014-09-02,19873663,Bhaskar,Paul was a very gracious host and the house was clean and well equipped with all the amenities we could have desired including a new wine opener set and snacks and fruits. All in all a great experience and wouldn't hesitate recommending the place to others 
3836973,19008780,2014-09-04,413267,An Minh,Fantastic location and fantastic home! The house was super clean and spacious. The owner kept me abreast of construction in the area that could affect traffic. There were no issues however but I appreciated his attention. I was also happy to see fruits snack bars and oatmeal for breakfast. 
3836973,19221497,2014-09-08,862141,Wayne,"Paul and his wife were wonderful hosts - very communicative, accommodating to our schedules, and sweet in leaving us fresh fruit.  Their home is very clean, comfortable, and has a lovely back yard area perfect for a nice brunch outside.  Highly recommend!
"
3836973,19622725,2014-09-15,19735575,Emily,"Paul and his wife were very accommodating.  We were traveling with 2 little ones and his wife met the baby equipment rental company at the house to set up the cribs.  The house was perfect for our group (4 adults, 2 children).  Our 2 year old son loved exploring the back yard area. The location was perfect and close to everything we needed. I would highly recommend Paul's home. The only thing that could be better is having a washer/dryer in the home.  However, there is a very clean, brand new laundromat 2 minutes away."
3836973,20042525,2014-09-22,1449611,Paige,"Paul's amazing Pacific Grove abode was completely perfect for what we and some of our couple friends were looking for during our friend's Carmel wedding — what a fun home base for little group to reunion at during our college friends' wedding weekend. Beautiful location, spotless & clean household with every amenity you could ask for.

Paul was so helpful and communicative and I didn't have to worry about or ask for a thing leading up to our stay. The house perfectly to a T matched what he described on Airbnb.

Also BONUS: Most luxurious Egyptian cotton sheets and bedding — a real home away from home, especially thanks to cleanliness. EXTRA BONUS: Beautiful charming garden in the back with roses and tons of seating. Thank you Paul!"
3836973,20429613,2014-09-29,4962834,Ian,"We had a great time in Monterey, thanks to Paul.  Great host, very responsive and accommodating.  We will definitively stay here again."
3836973,21101727,2014-10-11,609073,Lina,"This house is really comfortable and Paul was super helpful. We definitely will recommend this place and will consider it for next trips.
Beds are really comfortable, backyard is really nice. "
3836973,21205842,2014-10-13,18931813,Sally,"We had a great stay at the House in Pacific Grove. The house was easy to access, very clean and comfortable. There was plenty of space for my family of 6, with the 3 bedrooms, plus the office which was a great place to put our pack and play for my toddler son to sleep. We enjoyed the recommendation of Paul's wife for dinner one night, and then utilized the kitchen which was very well stocked for other meals. The house was centrally located to access by car our day outings including Monterey Bay Aquarium, Carmel Beach, and Spanish Bay. We were celebrating my mom's birthday and appreciated the thoughtful bottle of wine left for us.  We also enjoyed breakfast one morning sitting outside in the backyard garden. The only surprise was that the house is located in a main road, but it ended up not impacting the comfort of our stay in any way. "
3836973,21659300,2014-10-21,7992474,Jaimie,"We loved staying in Paul's house! I stayed there for a wedding weekend with my husband and two small children and it really was the perfect setup. The house was perfectly clean and Paul was completely accommodating and gave great suggestions pertaining to the house itself and the local area. The kids loved the fact that it was a one-story house and could run in and out to the yard at their leisure (not something they can do at home). The house had all of the kitchen necessities and we brought the rest. It truly was exactly what we were looking for, and conveniently only 5 minutes away from the wedding location. We would definitely consider staying there again."
3836973,21973393,2014-10-27,17129009,Benjamin,"we had a great experience with our host, Paul.  He was very helpful.  He left fruit, snacks and water for us which was above and beyond and really appreciated.  The home was more than we expected.  It was extremely clean and comfortable.  Location of the home is ideal.  Just a couple blocks away from 17 Mile Drive and not very far from Monterey Bay Aquarium.  "
3836973,22300244,2014-11-03,21233004,Debra,"This a beautiful newly remodeled house.  It feels like a new house, which was very clean! The house was very comfortable.  The backyard has a nice sitting area for 6 or more, with a gas BBQ.  There was even chairs for little ones.  It has a beautiful garden. There was a welcome plate with packages of oatmeal and breakfast.  We cooked dinner and breakfast!  The kitchen is stock with all the pans and utensils we needed. If you have little ones there is a surprise on the ceiling in the far front bedroom!  There is a school on the opposite corner with a playground!  This house was perfect for our family's night before the wedding!  The bonus for us was the 1 day rental. "
3836973,22611219,2014-11-10,5055112,Minh-Chi,"Paul was one of the best hosts! He communicated with us before, during, and after the trip to help ensure our group had everything we needed. He stocked the house with tips, restaurant recommendations, snacks, and fruit. The house itself is very roomy and comfortable and has basically anything a vacation house could need. I would definitely recommend his lovely home to friends and family."
3836973,22883875,2014-11-17,5564359,Yooly,"This home was picturesque perfect! I was a little worried as we were driving along the neighborhood but WOW....what a beautiful home. I even told my husband that I wanted to buy this place as I loved it so much. LoL 

A corner house tucked away between trees, from the moment we drove in we fell in love with this place. Quiet, secure and very private. The pictures Paul posted online does not do any justice of how beautiful this house is. The floor plan is very open from the living room to the kitchen and very spacious. I was also surprised at how large each of the rooms were too. The backyard was so peaceful that I just wanted to sit out there. 

The house was only 5 minute drive to downtown. A very easy drive straight down the street which made traveling with the family easy. 

Paul our host was great. He surprised us with a basket of fruits, which my mom really enjoyed along with snacks, water and other goodies. I really appreciated his extra care.  I wish I was able to stay at this home for a longer time and enjoy the house more."
3836973,23164150,2014-11-24,3532742,Andrea,"Paul was an incredibly host! It was very easy to communicate with him and he was quick to answer all of my questions. The house was beautiful, bright and sunny, and really clean.  We loved the kitchen / living room layout and were pleasantly surprised that the beds were incredibly comfortable.

I was disappointed to find that the trampoline in the listing pictures was not in the backyard (I was rather looking forward to trying my hand at it!) and it also wasn't terribly clear that the 4th bed was a pull-out couch. Lastly, the house is located on a main road and we found it tricky to get in and out of the drive way. I should mention that despite the location of the house, it was really quiet and peaceful which was great.  

All in all a great house and we would totally rent it again. Thank you Paul! 
"
3836973,23427792,2014-12-01,21153138,John,"This home in Pacific Grove was neat, clean and well appointed for my family's visit over the Thanksgiving holiday.  The location was near to the many activities in this area, groceries, restaurants and adjacent to a woodsy walking path.

Host description was accurate and we had a very pleasant stay.  >Wendy, sister to J. Canning"
3836973,23700332,2014-12-08,664373,Katy,"Paul was great! Made sure we had everything we needed for a hassle-free, enjoyable stay. The house and the location itself are great! Although our stay was short, it was the perfect place to show my parents all the beauty the Monterey peninsula has to offer!"
3836973,23904932,2014-12-14,23674715,Mo,"Paul was very helpful and friendly interacting with. He was very prompt on sending me information about the house and all of the amenities which was fantastic! The house is beautiful and a very nice spot to stay while visiting Monterey and the surrounding area - very easy to get to.
Although, unfortunately it was raining during our visit, the backyard is beautiful and looks like it would be a great place to relax during a sunny day! I would definitely stay here again."
3836973,24226604,2014-12-23,22677180,Car Ol,Great experience! Great location!
3836973,24387129,2014-12-27,9524825,David,House is very clean and comfortable. Garden is beautiful. Kitchen very well equipped. Overall had a great time there. The house is quite far away from downtown and beach so need to drive everywhere. Also the traffic is quite heavy outside as near a busy street intersection. Could be a bit of a concern with small kids.
3836973,24464942,2014-12-29,15497880,Sharlene,Paul was very accommodating and I could always count on getting a response from him within minutes of my inquiry. He even went an extra mile to give me and my family suggestions on places to visit with detailed driving/walking directions. The location is very convenient and the house was very clean and well stocked with snacks and drinks.
3836973,24723842,2015-01-02,20359663,Alex,"very welcome, accurate pics and description and a very active, involved and responsible host.  Supper clean home w a great backyard.  Would recommend for sure!"
3836973,25476102,2015-01-17,1489771,Dora,"Paul's home was absolutely beautiful and perfect!  Paul was a wonderful host, ensured that we had any and all information we needed to make our stay in his home and community enjoyable.  He was very responsive to the few questions we had.  The home is comfortable, nice amenities, beautiful outdoor patio area, and close to the Pacific Grove and Monterey attractions.  We will definitely stay there again!  Thanks Paul!"
3836973,25680979,2015-01-23,1423524,Melanie,"We hosted a work meeting here for ~20 people, and Paul was fabulous in accommodating our group, including providing a slew of foldable chairs in the garage for us if needed, and for answering our stream of questions both before and during the event.

The house itself is meticulously clean and very charming, both inside and out.  The back patio was a great place to relax and enjoy the sunshine!

We also appreciated the full stocked kitchen with all we needed to cook dinner for the group.  Even a crock pot!  :)  Thanks again for a great experience."
3836973,25757817,2015-01-25,21969241,Tyler,"Paul is fantastic. He accepted quickly, emailed me all information before I even asked for it. Excellent communication. The house was great and in a great location. The beds and bedrooms are comfortable. I would stay here again and recommend."
3836973,26313496,2015-02-09,5334474,Amy,"Paul was very accommodating and helpful for our trip! We had a glitch in payment but he was very helpful and flexible in helping get the issue resolved. The house was exactly as pictured, very cute and cozy and just what we wanted! I wish we would've been able to stay longer! Thanks Paul!"
3836973,26560791,2015-02-15,5491775,Aaron,"Great place and great location, would definitely stay here again."

3836973,27353259,2015-03-02,5341556,Jen,"Paul is an excellent host!  He responds quickly to messages and is very proactive about making sure we had all of the information needed for a great stay in Carmel.  

The house is modern & roomy with everything you need for a comfortable stay (extra pillows and blankets :)  They also have a beautiful courtyard, perfect for your morning coffee & croissant from the bistro about a mile away.  

I recommend this place to anyone staying with a group in Carmel!"
3836973,27601296,2015-03-08,27871232,Andrea,"Paul was excellent and his home was very welcoming.  Paul did a great job communicating and was incredibly accommodating.  The location was perfect, we were able to walk/drive to all the locations we had planned on."
3836973,27738019,2015-03-10,9357208,Kim,Paul was responsive to all communications. The house was comfortable and clean. We appreciated the welcome of fresh fruit and a thoughtful card regarding some personal trials that almost interfered with our travel. the location was ideal for our desired activities... The walks to the beach were wonderful. Accessibility to modern conveniences such as stores and restaurants was a plus. 
3836973,27999523,2015-03-16,26276528,Joy,"The description of the house was accurate. The house is not palatial but it's spacious in a cozy and appealing way. Everything worked and the kitchen, bathrooms, etc. were supplied well. The only thing lacking was a washer and dryer. If we were going to stay longer, that would be a bigger issue. There are laundromats nearby but it adds a logistic to an already-busy weekend. The garden is really great. The house is conveniently located to the things we wanted to do. My dad uses a walker and had no problem navigating the driveway, the interior of the house, and the garden. Typical of the area, there are no sidewalks in the neighborhood. Paul checked in ahead of arrival day, after we arrived, and after we left -- he has a great touch. All in all, we would happily return to this house for future family gatherings!"
3836973,28468611,2015-03-24,728605,David,"Paul was extremely responsive and kept in touch with me the whole process through. The home was lovely, clean and well kept. It served as a perfect vacation stay for myself and my family and we would definitely come back again. "
3836973,28571065,2015-03-26,10621274,Max,We had a great stay.  Paul was very helpful and the house is really nice and comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for a better place to host our group of six.

The house is very clean and organized. It has a pretty private garden - perfect for us to relax and chat. 
We really enjoyed our stay at the house. Thank you, Paul! "
3836973,28884036,2015-03-31,21662612,Rosalyn,"We stayed in Paul's house for 2 nights, and I wished we would have booked a longer stay, but my husband needed to get back to work! Paul was so easy to work with. He responds very quickly to all inquiries. He checked on us before, during and after our trip.  

The house itself is just as described. One of the main reasons I chose a rental over a hotel was because we were travelling with little ones (all under 4 y.o.) and because we were celebrating my sister's birthday. It's very hard to get comfortable in a cramped hotel room! There was plenty of room for 7 adults and 3 toddlers the first night we stayed. Everything was/felt new, clean, fresh and oh so comfortable. I especially loved the master bath and all the closet space! The kitchen had all the basic needs, including a rice cooker, which came in handy the second night! There were fresh flowers, a plate of snacks, a bowl of fruit, and mini water bottles in the fridge for us! How awesome is that? The backyard was perfect to relax in. Our little ones loved running around back there. 

The location of this house is very convenient. It's close to everything. It's a corner lot, and I was initially worried about traffic getting in and out of the driveway but had no problems at all. It's really close to Save Mart, Rite Aid, Safeway and Trader Joe's. We drove to Lover's Point, Asilomar State Beach, Dennis the Menace Park, and of course the Aquarium and Cannery Row. Less than a 10 minute drive to each of these spots from the house. I wish we had had more time to do more, but 2 days was just not enough time! 

The only thing I wish we had access to was a washer and dryer but there is a very nice Laundromat a few minutes away. After our trip to the beach I really wanted to wash all of our beach towels so that they would be nice and clean! Otherwise, this house was perfect for us. I would most certainly stay again! Thank you Paul!"
3836973,29065927,2015-04-03,9212649,Mayra,"The house is beautiful and clean, newly remodeled and spacious. All beds were very comfortable and location is great. It has a great backyard and garden, very well taken care of that my 4-year old son enjoyed tremendously. Paul was a great host, he responded to messages immediately and was available for questions any time during our stay. It was nice to arrive at the house and find that we had fruit, snacks, water and a bottle of wine waiting for us! We will be back!"
3836973,29709842,2015-04-11,892764,Rodney,"Easy to find. Clean, very nice, beautiful backyard patio/garden.  Easy walk to spectacular beach trails.  Trader Joe's nearby.  Paul was in touch throughout.  Would readily stay here again."
3836973,29746496,2015-04-12,16297722,Jennifer,"The house was very easy to find, and very convenient to the local restaurants and downtown without being too close and loud. The house was spotless and had an amazing backyard. The beds were super comfy and very clean. The granola bars, fruit, oatmeal, coffee and tea were much appreciated!  "
3836973,29854417,2015-04-13,27188939,Ze,"Paul is a wonderful host. He is very familiar with the area so he answered every question I asked with a lot of detail. He is also very flexible with our request. We arrived much earlier than the check-in time(11:30AM) and were able to get in and put stuff, food in the house , although cleaning stuff hadn't finished cleaning.
The house itself is wonderful too. Nice backyard and a big living room that can host more than 10 people.
Overall, It's a very good experience staying at Paul's house. Hope we have a chance to come back again. "
3836973,30192920,2015-04-19,27169224,Lynette,"Great house in a great neighborhood. Easy access to stores and 17-mile drive. Paul made us feel welcome with a fully stocked house and answered all of our questions promptly. 

We were particularly pleased with the cleanliness and open layout. The house even had fresh flowers when we arrived, as well as a platter of goodies and water in the refrigerator--small details, but so thoughtful. Would consider staying here again for work trips and on personal vacations. 

Our group of four was very comfortable during our stay. "
3836973,30340072,2015-04-20,30740676,Frances,"Amazing house, clean , comfortable, great location, warm and cozy, well stocked. Perfect for families. Paul is an exceptional host. "
3836973,30857202,2015-04-28,26166188,Christopher,"Paul's place was awesome! everything you see on the listing is what you get and more! When we arrived, Paul made it real easy for us to get comfortable and he even left us some goodies which everyone enjoyed. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable and the yard was a awesome spot to relax in the sun. The kitchen was great and had all the things you needed to make a home cooked meal. (just bring your own seasonings).The neighbor is very nice. Very close to the beach, stores, and downtown Monterey. I would stay here again next time I visit this area.  "
3836973,31230831,2015-05-03,10686665,Felix,"Paul was very welcoming and responsive from the time that we made our reservation. He answered questions quickly and accommodated us with early check-in / late check-out as much as possible. 

The house itself was immaculate - 3 full beds and 1 pull out bed, a spacious kitchen with nice porcelain dishes and what looked like new utensils. The back patio was huge and was an excellent hang out spot for barbecuing, socializing, and kicking back with some brews.

A short 0.5 miles to grocery stores (safeway, rite aid, etc...) made our night very convenient, and Asilomar Beach was only a 5 minute drive.

Would definitely recommend staying at this place!"
3836973,31441581,2015-05-05,29327480,Jane,The host is a super nice guy. The house is very clean and warm. My family and I (total 5 people) stayed in the house and we love everything that Paul has prepared for us. The little garden is very nice and clean. Bedrooms are neat and tidy. I would definitely refer my friends to stay in this house!

Check-in/check-out was painless. The house is fully stocked. The backyard garden with the grill was the icing on the cake."
3836973,31904907,2015-05-11,29536596,Kevin,Paul was a great host.  He was very friendly and quick to respond to any questions.  His home had everything to make our weekend stay a comfortable one.  It was very clean and spacious.  The kitchen supplied all the tools needed to make a home cooked meal.  All three bedrooms and one sofa bed allowed for everyone to enjoy a good night rest.  The backyard/patio was a nice place to sit outside and relax.  The location was convenient and easy to get to.  We were very pleased with our stay and would recommend this house to anyone visiting the area.
3836973,32586129,2015-05-19,2370642,Jose Vicente,Paul was a great host. Always available and his property welcoming and very nice...
3836973,32975503,2015-05-24,1457703,Allison,"Paul has a lovely home, with lots of queen size beds. We were a party of six/three couples, and we each had our own private room with plenty of closet space. Checkin and out were both very easy, and the home was clean and comfortable. Kitchen had everything we needed for a dinner of wine, cheese, and fruit, and the outside patio was comfortable and spacious. 

Nice place!"
3836973,33251407,2015-05-26,11742976,Karen,"Paul's lovely house in Pacific Grove was the perfect place for us. The 8 of us (4 adults, 4 kids under 5) stayed for two nights. Check in was very easy and the house is very clean, the rooms are comfortable and the yard is beautiful with lots of flowers. Our kids had a lot of fun playing together while the adults relaxed over meals. 

The location is also very close to grocery stores, downtown Pacific Grove and Monterey. We would love to stay again when we visit again. "
3836973,33469154,2015-05-28,20729592,Sahil,The house was cozy and really well located. My mum loved the garden in the back. Would highly recommend staying here. 
3836973,33957631,2015-06-02,34138936,Jonathan,Couldn't ask for a better first experience with Airbnb! Paul was very accommodating and the house was perfect for my new family. Thanks again for hosting us!
3836973,34253891,2015-06-06,11340740,Matthew,"Overall it was an unpleasant experience, house was Ok, next to a busy road junction and with paper thin walls so you could hear the whole house. We were left wine and breakfast stuff which was good and it had everything we needed for our family. Paul offered good initial communication but once we left the trouble started. We left the house in a very clean state, no issues but then we were sent a bill for $450 to buy and fit a new waste disposal. We were there 3 days and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times with no issues so this was a real shock. We then had to go through the whole airbnb deposit process explaining ourselves. We rejected the claim and Paul although polite then did not respond to us and just said deal with airbnb. Like asking for proof it was only 1 yr old and why he didn't claim from the guarantee, he knew we where still on our vacation so it was a real drain on our time having to deal with it. Thankfully Airbnb rejected his claim but it frankly should not have happened. I have rented out my own properties in the UK for over 8 yrs so have plenty of experience and when small things break you take it in the chin. Hopefully Paul will learn from this and realise you should not go out of your way to ruin experiences for people with outlandish claims. We would not recommend this property to others."
3836973,34410646,2015-06-08,29239231,Jerome,"I must first start with the awesome,location you,could actually be at the aquarium in 25 minutes walking,which in a busy downtown is a great thing.  The house was perfect for us as we like to hang,out by the dinner table and catch up with family.  I love how close it was to the golf course as well taking only two minutes to get to pebble great stay and thanks "
3836973,34630111,2015-06-10,30436566,Yuxuan,We had a very comfortable night at Paul's. Paul is very helpful. Great Experience. 
3836973,35083598,2015-06-15,17773365,Rod,"This house lived up to its billing as a lovely house in Monterey.  Very clean and cozy.  Thoughtful layout and perfect for my not so small family of five.  For those of you who like to travel but not feel the sterility of a hotel especially amongst a row of hotels.  A vacation rental is the way to go.  

This was my first vacation rental experience but will definitely not be my last.  Paul, the owner, is friendly and attentive to his renters.  Quick responses that via text are addressed and left me feeling like we were a first priority.  He even had plenty of great suggestions for sites to see in the area which was new to us.  Inside the home were all the comforts of a nice home.  Lovely kitchen with every utensil provided.   Every appliance from dishwasher to stackable washer and dryer.  Wifi, cable TV, blue ray player with Netflix and other TV services, electronic access to and from house and garage.  

Also there were towels, bedding and very comfortable beds to boot.  The backyard is especially quaint and charming.  We spent quite a bit of time just sitting in the lush backyard soaking up the wonderful central coast climate.

So close to Spanish bay, pebble beach golf course, 17 mile drive and also close to Trader Joes, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and fisherman's wharf.

A great experience overall."
3836973,35390189,2015-06-18,32456723,Maria,"House was very quaint with nice amenities. It was the perfect size for our family and my parents (7 total). We all loved our stay and felt comfortable immediately. All the extras provided were a delight. The close proximity to the grocery store was great. While another reviewer mentioned the busy street, I feel that I would categorize it as a moderately quiet street. No trouble with noise or traffic whatsoever. Also, Paul the owner has great communication and provided wonderful suggestions on things to do. This was our first time using Airbnb, and this home & Paul exceeded our expectations...we are hooked and will definitely book again!"
3836973,35907525,2015-06-23,4366675,Ashley,My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Paul's house. He was extremely helpful in answering all of our questions.  Check in was very simple and the house was very clean.   It was a very good experience.

Paul responded to inquires promptly and checked with us a few times to make sure we had a good experience. Definitely would like to come back!"
3836973,37288889,2015-07-06,1221580,Lesley,"Paul's house was a lovely and homey spot for a large group of twentysomethings to stay at. We especially liked the charming outdoor patio area in the back to unwind after a long day of hiking. As a host, he is very communicative and will answer any questions you may have about the house or the area its in promptly. I'd highly recommend Paul to anyone in the Airbnb community."

The home itself was wonderful. Very comfortable, beautiful (especially the backyard!!) and well-appointed. Thank you Paul for such hospitality, kindness, and a fabulous trip. It's worth noting the office in the back that both  my sister-in-law and I took full advantage of. I wish I had such a comfortable place to work in my own home!"
3836973,38097630,2015-07-13,27974458,Jennifer,"The back patio was absolutely charming! It was a great place for our morning coffee and chat. The rest of the house was clean well appointed and very comfortable. Plus its a nice quiet street at night, so we were able to get our Zzzs. We were all very happy with our stay."

Three spacious bedrooms with very good beds. Kitchen very well equipped so we used it a lot to make supper. Lovely garden that we did not use that much since the weather was a little chilly and overcast. The house is practical in terms of situation as well close to all interesting sight in the area.

The kitchen was well appointed, lots of dishes and utensils, and pots and pans.  Large fridge and ice maker freezer.  The bedrooms are large light and roomy.  Comfortable beds and nice linens.  Floor space for extra guests was ample.  The neighborhood was quiet.  Walking to Asilomar and downtown Pacific Grove was easily done.  The garden was beautiful.  Nice outdoor furniture.  I loved the garage door and front door opening and locking system.  Paul was the most responsive host EVER!!!!  I can't wait for our group to return next year.  "
3836973,40262261,2015-07-29,2863556,Tommy,"Paul was superb in his communication with us prior to our arrival.  He was not only very welcoming, but his check-in instructions were super clear and super easy thanks to his electronic lock!  

Paul played the role of local expert incredibly well.  He recommended a variety of local restaurants, as well as his favorite local hike.  We ended up driving the hike instead of hiking it.  :-)

And of course Paul's place was extra comfortable and that back patio was just perfectly done.  We shared some relaxing moments in the nice summer weather there.  "
3836973,40380405,2015-07-30,24443137,Mylene,"We stayed in Pauls house just for one night cause we just booked the place like 4 or 3 days from the time we stayed, Pauls place was fully booked. We hope to stay much longer.. (anyway we got another place for the next 3 nights). Another thing was Paul always respond immediately that makes it easier to us to make the right decision to stay in his house.  Our experienced with Pauls place was awesome , it was really homey!  The place was very clean and organized. We enjoyed the Patio especially the twins who was a girl and a boy named Lilith & Lucian 3yrs. old they enjoyed playing in the garden , and loved the small bench really designed for kids. The TV room and bedrooms are relaxing. I love the small office, there are pamphlets / brochure that gives us ideas what to do and where to go in Monterey and Pacific Grove. The place was very convenient, it was walking distance to Save Mart & Safeway, and restaurants. It was near 17 mile, Pebble beach and Spanish bay. Over all it was a nice experienced. We will definitely book his house again if we come back :)"
3836973,40703268,2015-08-02,16958107,Karen,"This was a fantastic experience all round. The host could not have been more welcoming and went out of his way to ensure we had a fantastic time in Monterey. Lots of valuable hints and tips about where to eat etc. The house is ideally located giving easy access to Monterey,  Carmel and the 17 mile drive.  The house was presented in a spotless immaculately clean manner and is exceptionally generously equipped. The host is very attentive to his guests and answered any queries very promptly. It was a 5 star experience all round. "

It was relaxing and refreshing to stay in a home vs a hotel room with our larger group of 7.  Everything was clean and the beds were all comfortable.

The back patio was a lovely place to hang out and enjoy the garden. We were visited by a hummingbird several times which was an extra bonus!  The house is located in the perfect location to visit the beach, Carmel + Monterey.  We used it as our base to drive down the big sur.  Would highly recommend this house!"

Everything was ready for us and he had every detail down, including his instructions on how to find the home, work the pre-programmed locks (and access the WiFi!) , suggestions on where to visit, etc. The home was exactly as pictured, in fact, it was better!

Paul was easy to communicate with & very accommodating when we found we had to modify our booking. All of the bedding was very comfortable & we enjoyed the outdoor area around the barbecue.

Paul is such a considerate host, always responsive and accommodating to our inquiries and request.

Paul is such a great owner/host. He made the whole booking/check-in/check-out very easy for us. A week before, he emailed us all the details information and we had no difficulty finding the place and settling down. Upon check-in, there were water, fruits/crackers and bottle of wine waiting for us. We went to one of the restaurants he recommended and really enjoyed the food and service. While we were there, an power outage occurred. Paul quickly responded with the cause and updates from PGE, followed up by dropping off the emergency lights and mobile device charging station. 
The house is the same as, if not better than, what was described online. Great location with beach, restaurants, grocery stores close by. Inside, it is clean, cozy/comfortable, and nicely decorated. The house is well equipped from entertainment, internet to kitchen stuff.
We will not hesitate to recommend Paul and his lovely house to other travelers. It is one of those combination that will add very good memory to your future trip.

3836973,61236973,2016-02-01,21485749,Woo Jin,"Paul's house was fantastic for my family trip! Location was perfect; close to everything you can do at Monterey, including golfing and visiting Monterey Aquarium. The bbq grill worked great so we could enjoy a wonderful dinner. 
Rooms are much better than the pictures and the kitchen has everything you might need. There is parking space large enough to park three big cars without using the garage. 
Paul answered the questions I asked promptly as well. Thanks Paul! I hope I can stay there next time too."
3836973,61600430,2016-02-06,174989,Jen,"Perfect location, great for what I needed to do - work and hike.  Paul was so fast to respond to any questions and beyond helpful when it came to wanting information for hiking, etc.  I felt completely taken care of:)  I also liked the setup of the house, the main room really has two sitting areas so if I had been there with others, there would have been spaces for each of us.  I hiked Asilomar, Pebble Beach and a few other places all within miles from the house.  Felt like a little nook in the midst of my favorite area to visit.   Bonus of Trader Joes around the corner and I loved the Grove Market - great Salmon!"
3836973,62512020,2016-02-15,4956534,Mark,"Pauls place was just as described...clean, spacious and convenient. Our group of 4 had plenty of space and loved the location just outside 17 mile drive and close to all our favorite spots in pacific grove.  If you've never been its one of the most beautiful places to watch a sunset on the planet.  Plenty of great restaurants close by as well. Paul was extremely helpful with all of our needs and very quick to respond.  Looking forward to coming back again next year.  "

The house was clean and nicely stocked with surprises in the fridge (fresh fruit and water bottles). We also loved the cute garden and patio out back. If only the weather had been better for us to enjoy it. Paul was in constant contact and easy to reach for questions.

We had everything we needed in the kitchen, and even a roasting pan to make our Easter dinner!  The addition of extra kid-sized mattresses for our toddler was great.  Also the inclusion of snacks, water in the fridge, and soap and shampoo in the shower, was a nice perk.  Paul was very responsive to any questions that came up both before our arrival and during our stay.  I would highly recommend Paul's lovely home and we will definitely return on our next trip to the area."
3836973,67916993,2016-04-01,15588010,Amy,"The house worked perfectly for our group, which included kids.

So welcoming when you walk through the front door with everything spotless and well appointed, and with a lovely garden visible through the windows as you enter.  All the items we needed were there, including water in the fridge and fruit on the kitchen counter.  The beds were so comfortable, we wanted to take them home.  The bathrooms were spotless and they even had liquid hand soap on the counters.  It was obvious that great attention was paid to every detail in preparation for our stay.  The outdoor garden was such a lovely bonus.  Paul was so easy to contact and so helpful with every detail of our stay.  He got back to me immediately with any information or questions that I had both before and during out visit.  We will without a doubt stay here on our next visit to Monterey."

It was as if family was expecting you and laid out the hospitality red carpet!  Paul communicated from the start of booking on what to do, where to do it,,,just a great overview of an area I knew we would like but never before visited.  Refreshments and fresh flowers waiting after a long trip from back East was just wonderful.  During our stay Paul answered all inquiries quickly and with great detail.  Kudos to his wife's garden efforts and beautiful roses.  Morning coffee and early evening wine on the patio was like paradise!  The home was clean, light, quiet and attractive.  
Thank you for making the special time with our grandson more special.  (Try not to miss the drive to Big Sur and Mcway Falls,,just gorgeous)"

We had planned to try one of the restaurants Paul had recommended but everyone settled into the lovely back yard and decided to use his barbecue and enjoy the surroundings.  Directions for use of house & area detailed & easy to follow.  Nice  walks:  beach and many trails to enjoy.  Paul is an excellent host!  I asked many questions and he not only followed through on those but gave extra very helpful suggestions and mentioned side trips for us to try as we traveled away from  Pacific Grove.   Definitely a home away from home to return to when in the area!
3836973,74843062,2016-05-17,401518,Elsa,"My family was visiting from out of town, and my husband and I decided to drive them south along route 1. We planned this at the last minute, and wanted to spend the night around Monterey or Carmel. Paul's house in Pacific Grove was perfect for our group of six adults. 

Everything was clean and tidy; the kitchen and bathrooms were stocked with all the essentials; and the backyard was absolutely lovely. There was even a thoughtfully arranged bowl of snacks and fresh fruit laid out for us. 

The location was perfect! Just steps away from 17-mile drive, my husband and I enjoyed a scenic run from the house through Spanish Bay to just past Point Joe. Coffee, food, and cute souvenir stores can be found on Lighthouse Ave., which is just a short ride (or 25min walk) away."

It was a quiet neighborhood, the garden was well-kept full of flowers and very nice to enjoy a coffee in the morning or a cocktail in the afternoon. Paul had a ton of recommendations. He was very informative with fantastic local recommendations, and transportation.  Passionfish was delicious place to go have dinner that he recommended and its less then a 10 minute drive from the house. Paul checked in on a regular basis, and was prompt with responding to any questions. We loved our stay at his cozy home in Pacific Grove. Highly recommend it! If we ever come back to Monterey for a vacation we will definitely be contacting Paul again. Thank you Paul for your wonderful hospitality!"
3836973,77619765,2016-06-02,72039160,Nick,"The Lovely Pacific Grove house was perfect for us. 
The house is in a great location between the 17 mile drive and Cannery Row. It is on a corner lot, and the road can be a bit noisy at times. But it quiets down after 10pm and was not a problem for sleeping. 
I was traveling with a 16 month old, my wife, and two elderly parents. The house had everything we needed, but none of the knick knacks that can be a problem with a little explorer in the house. We did a quick sweep of the house to help baby proof. Most of the outlets already had baby protection built in. We put a few things (like air fresheners, fireplace tools, etc.) out of reach, and we were good to go. 
Paul was a great host. Good communication. He checked in several times before and during the stay to make sure everything was as good as possible. On our arrival, the house was in good shape. There was a bowl off fruit and a plate with tea, oatmeal, and other conveniences waiting for us. We felt comfortable right away. 
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I definitely recommend the Lovely House in Pacific Grove. "
3836973,78063502,2016-06-05,54901768,Jane,Paul was a terrific host!

And the backyard was beautiful and relaxing for all of us. We highly recommend Paul and lovely home.

Paul is very helpful and accommodating, and I never hesitated to ask him if I needed anything.  The home is ideally located in the center of the peninsula, so it is close to beaches, downtown Pacific Grove, Cannery Row, Carmel -- everywhere you will want to go.  There were fresh flowers and fruit when we arrived, and snacks that helped when we headed off hiking.   Definitely recommend this home."
3836973,79206960,2016-06-11,408135,Ivan,"We had the pleasure of staying in Paul’s house for 4 days and we loved everything about it! First and foremost, the location is fantastic. We had decided to play in Monterey and Big Sur and Paul’s house was the perfect central spot to go to both places. It’s also well situated in Pacific Grove with quick access to a grocery store as well as a nice walk down to Lover’s Point (and the great paved running trail there that runs along the coast). The house is just as you see in the pictures: bright and clean. Paul has thought of every detail with little helpful notes around the house. I love to cook and the kitchen is well stocked with any cooking utensil you might want or need. We also loved the keypad lock on the front door and want to get one for our own house now – it was so simple and quick to use! Paul was extremely responsive to any questions we had while we were staying in the house and gave us great tips on places to eat and things to do. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay in this house again – we had a great time and were sad to leave."

3836973,79884839,2016-06-14,30603308,Leigh,"The house was beautiful and very well located, as advertised. There were also so many thoughtful touches - snacks, fruit, water, extra shampoo, etc. Any question I might have had about the house itself was already answered in thorough messages and documentation, and Paul was quickly responsive to my random questions, as well. He offered great ideas for sights to see and easy ways to access the sights, as well as insider's tips to get back to the airport on time. It was like having a helpful friend in the neighborhood. An overall fantastic experience!"

The back yard is lovely and has nice sitting areas and a gas BBQ grill. House has a lot of natural lighting.  
The house is on a very busy street corner. There is an elementary school across the street. Traffic noise is very noticeable especially if you like to open the windows or sitting in the backyard. 
House is very close to several grocery stores, only a mile or two away. We shopped at Trader Joe. We brought bicycles and really enjoyed biking from the house to downtown Monterey and Pacific Grove. There are a few steep hills but they are very short. Overall, a great family get away stay. "

The house was fully equipped, clean, and well-situated. The backyard is impeccably landscaped, and was a great place to enjoy rib-eyes on the grill. We all enjoyed our stay. Paul was a perfect host and easy to communicate with, our trip went off exactly as planned, and we would all highly recommend this home to others."

3836973,83671137,2016-07-03,45237687,Amy,"We had a wonderful experience staying in this lovely home. Though we are locals, my sister got married in Monterey over the weekend and we wanted to stay at a home with the wedding party closer to the venue and this house was perfect for our needs. The host is welcoming, easy to coordinate with, and accommodating of our changing schedule and particular needs associated with the wedding. He even provided makeup removal pads, snacks and waters. The backyard is particularly beautiful and was a nice setting for our 'getting ready' pictures. Though not too far from a convenient intersection, the house is set far back enough and sheltered from any street noise and our stay was peaceful and enjoyable. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it! Thanks again Paul! "
3836973,84079478,2016-07-05,29713558,Priyashree,"Perfect!

Paul's house is very clean and a perfect example of what Airbnb stands for.

Paul was super nice and helpful during my stay. It was very quite during night that I could enjoy my peace of time sitting in the garden, looking the stars. The house also has a garage which could make my car safe and cool. Supermarket and coffee store are very close. We also enjoyed the very tasty fruit from the tree in garden.  "

Both he and his wife are so nice, considerate and well prepared for our arrival. The house is exactly the same as described in those pictures: spacious, clean and sweet. U can find almost everything U've expected. Paul has provided us with lots of useful local information such as his favorite seafood restaurant and sunset trails. The house is so well located with nice trails around and super close to the amazingly beautiful 17 miles. We've only stayed for two days, and obviously that's far from enough. Staying at Paul's cosy house is a sweet part of  our U.S. trip this summer, and hope we could have a chance to come back in the near future! "

Paul's instructions and communication made checking into the property easy. We were a group of 5 ladies and the accommodations were very comfortable for our trip. The court yard area is ideal for relaxing and enjoying a little quiet time. We appreciated the snacks and fruit that was provided. If we find ourselves back in the area we will definitely rent again. The location was ideal, close to grocery stores and attractions.   We can only hope that when we book another Airbnb in the future we have the same experience."

Our family was traveling in from out of town to celebrate our mom's birthday and we arrived early in the Monterey area. Paul and his wife very flexible in allowing us to drop off our luggage and park a couple of our vehicles while they finished up getting the place ready for us. additionally, Paul was flexible in allowing us an extra hour at check out. 

The home was a very nice, comfortable home in a very quiet neighborhood situated close to grocery stores, restaurants, Fisherman's Wharf and Cannery Row.

The location was very convenient to our dinner spot (Fifi's Bistro Cafe) and our post golf lunch spot (Yi's).  Paul was a pleasure to work with.  He responded promptly to every inquiry and the Air Bnb listing was spot on.  Rooms were clean, nice hot showers with good water pressure.  We did not have time to enjoy the outdoor patio and grill but would have enjoyed this part of the property had we had more time.  Will definitely be back for a guys trip!"

He recommended restaurants and things to do that fit with our interests.  The house was clean and comfortable.  It was the perfect spot for a family of 4 with older teens.  It proved to be a great location for day trips in and around the Monterey area.

What we didn't know was how many treasures the garden had.  There were specialty flowers and plants.  Through our bedroom window we could watch hummingbirds.

We shared wonderful meals in the cozy kitchen and restful sleeps in the beds.  Paul had left a basket of apples and snacks for us that was the perfect welcome after a very long day of travel.  

Although we didn't end up needed more information, I knew Paul was just a phone call away if we needed him for advice or help.  I could not have asked for a better host!"

The house was perfect for our needs and was located in a prime location (close enough to easily get to all of the areas that we wanted to visit yet far enough to escape the throngs of tourists).  The house had all of the amenities that we expected and wanted.  We also loved not having to carry keys around with us (keypad entrance) and we liked being able to use the garage to store our bikes. We had a great time and hope to be back soon!

Paul went over and above what I would expect from a host. He stayed in contact with me from the day we reserved the house all the way up to the stay which made me feel like I was staying at a friends house versus a strangers, definitely made for a comfortable stay.

Pacific Grove is our go-to vacation spot for short vacation and his home was truly wonderful even to the relaxing back yard.  I attended a conference in Monterey and drove there in 10 mins even during rush hour.  Conveniently located and 5 mins to Aquarium and Lover's Point.  Grocery shopping 3 blocks away including Trader Joe's, Lucky's and Safeway--bbq worked perfectly.  Kitchen equipped with everything!  Spent a perfectly warm/sunny day taking pictures on 17 Mile Drive and lunch at Pebble Beach so not much better than that.  Can't wait to return--hopefully soon!"

3836973,180575853,2017-08-10,36920816,Jaime Lee,"The house was fabulous, big size, lovely outdoor area, very clean, excellent extra little touches like shampoo/conditioner, coffee etc. Great location close to Monterey and Carmel. My whole family had a great time and everyone commented on how much they loved the place - Paul is an amazing host and was super prompt and helpful with suggestions to make our time more enjoyable. Would definitely stay there again."
3836973,180993769,2017-08-11,134492186,Minghua,"这个房子适合二个家庭住,房子很大,设备齐全。交通方便,值得一住,就是价格有点高"
3836973,181412388,2017-08-12,136426450,Chetan,"The only regret I have is that we didn't get enough time to spend in the home. It was spotless, updated amenities in the kitchen, the patio was great and so was the collection of games et. which the kids tried out. Not to mention, it was close to the beach. Paul was also great with communication, replying to my messages right away. Highly recommend it."
3836973,183611667,2017-08-17,28130081,Tom,"This is a fine place.  It's sort of on a busy road.   It isn't fancy.  

It's a good clean place to stay 

Paul was very considerate.   He gets 5 stars.  The home gets 3.5. "
3836973,185390244,2017-08-21,92422875,John,I highly recommend this house for a relaxing vacation stay or whatever your objective in exploring the near endless offerings of the Monterey area!
3836973,186849527,2017-08-25,85597500,Thomas,Paul was very prompt with his communication and his apartment is clean airy and an ideal place to stay for those travelling down the coast
3836973,187267156,2017-08-26,89479665,Gimlet,"非常漂亮的小屋,位置也很好,特别适合六到八个人的住宿,各种设施都比较齐全,Paul相当热心,会有许多的推荐,而且回复速度很快。很遗憾只在蒙特雷待了一晚上,不过却是段很棒的旅程。Thanks, Paul."
3836973,187869823,2017-08-27,55261,Sukhbir,"Paul is a great host and his place is clean, well located and cozy. It was perfect for our weekend retreat. Highly recommended!"
3836973,188200920,2017-08-28,99814764,Judy,"非常热情好客的主人,房子位置佳,离各景点都很近。步行5分钟即有超市,饭店。入住信息准确详细,五星推荐。"
3836973,189115763,2017-08-31,10997330,Mila,"This house was exactly as the photos promised:  clean, spacious, well-laid out and efficiently furnished. The beds were comfortable.  The kitchen was well-equipped  with everything we needed to prepare meals.  There were more than enough dishes and utensils for the 4 of us so we could run the dishwasher only when it was full, saving water and energy.

Paul is a superb host.  He responded to all my messages within minutes (!!!)  and was very generous with letting us check in an hour early and out an hour later.  

I would highly recommend this property to friends and family.  There is enough common space for when you want to be sociable and enough private space (garden, bedroom, den) for when you want privacy."
3836973,190740157,2017-09-04,1268749,Saurabh,"Paul as a host is amazing! It was a very hot weekend (it was 114 in the bay area, 80s in Monterey). My 3 month old son was very unhappy with the heat, so Paul especially drove for 2-3 hours in rush hour traffic to drop off a fan! He also gave great advice on places to visit and really made us feel at home. Thank you for letting us stay in your house!"
3836973,192672311,2017-09-10,146702149,云龙,Paul is very nice hosting for my family. And he answers the questions in time and very useful. My family have a happy time in this house. Super market is very close to the house. About 5 minutes walking distance. I like this house
3836973,193761524,2017-09-14,54405764,Suyang,"PAUL是个非常棒的房东,非常友好,第一次airbnb体验给了我们很棒的回忆。推荐的餐厅也是一流。房子很干净,配套齐全。以后会推荐朋友入住~"
3836973,194935765,2017-09-17,50401153,Lori,Paul was a great host and accommodated our schedule.  He checked in a few times via text and had great recommendations.  Everything was really nice and it was a quick walk to the grocery store up the hill.  Thanks so much.
3836973,197159512,2017-09-24,140167854,Kristina,"My friends and I rented Paul's home to serve as a base for a low-key girls' weekend and couldn't have been happier! Not only was Paul a gracious host and quick with communication, but when I had to change the guest count last minute (a friend was unable to get off work) he also approved a refund within 24 hours of the change! 

The home itself was very welcoming and we kept joking how it felt like we were staying at a relatives' house. The beds were comfortable, the place was spotless yet still inviting, there was even some welcome fruit in the fridge upon our arrival. It's the perfect size for six or seven guests easy without feeling too on top of each other. Which is a feat when you have six girls and two bathrooms! 

We enjoyed the patio in the morning sun and open living spaces between outings, but the biggest selling point for us all was how accessible the house was. A good friend of mine who was able to come is in a wheelchair and from parking space to entry access to bathrooms we didn't hit a snag once on her ability to move around! Definitely a place I would suggest staying at for anyone looking for a great home to stay in, and will be on my list when I'm back in the area! Truly a wonderful first Air BnB experience that beats any hotel I've stayed at in Monterey in the past!"
3836973,199410732,2017-10-01,81952008,Sandy,Close to everything exciting in the area! Paul is awesome to work with as a host.
3836973,202326566,2017-10-10,38132656,欣,"Paul是一位非常棒的房东,他提供了非常漂亮、舒适的房子和非常贴心的服务。我在Airbnb住过一些房子,入住Paul的房子是我最棒的一次选择。"

3836973,205004090,2017-10-20,70252928,Elizabeth,Comfortable space. Centrally located. Quick response from Paul.
3836973,206317308,2017-10-24,74340384,Atabek,"This is a wonderful place with a nice garden. Paul was very attentive to our requests and did a great job in orienting us, newcomers to Pacific Grove, what the best places are to visit around."
3836973,207767735,2017-10-29,6141177,Nora,"We were a group of 3 friends with small kids and had a great weekend in Pacific Grove. 
Paul is an excellent host. He’s very responsive for all questions and was very flexible with checking in and out. He made sure we arrived well and he gave us some great tips on where to go with kids.
The house was perfect. Very clean, warm but not overdecorated and well equipped. Nice garden and enough space to park 3 cars. Great value, great spot, great host, would definately recommend."
3836973,211405065,2017-11-12,16552524,Christopher,Paul was a great host and was easy to communicate with. He answered all my questions timely and made check-in absolutely painless. The house itself is just as it appears in the pics. The house is located in Pacific Grove which is close to everything you’d likely want to visit in Monterey/Carmel area. Our group of 6 had a great time and there was plenty of space for us all to spread out. The backyard and bbq grill was a definite bonus. I would highly recommend this house and will consider staying there in the future.
3836973,213378874,2017-11-20,6202045,Stella,"Paul is a very easy going person and stay responsive through our stay. We requested an early check-in and a late check-out, which all got approved by Paul. It’s a very nice place and we will sure come back next time when visiting Monterey."
3836973,214813900,2017-11-26,44355248,Clara,Wow! What a find.  We spent Thanksgiving week here and loved every minute! Spacious house fit eight of us comfortably and kitchen allowed us to cook a feast.  I was grateful for Paul's warm hospitality.  We will be back!
3836973,216801607,2017-12-05,30384212,Nicole,"Wow, this was the first place we stayed in where we had SPACE! Loved that there was room for everyone and not right on top of each other. We also really enjoyed the garden space, so lovely with a cup of tea any time of day. If you visit PG often you will love that this is located right next to the main strip of shops (namely the TJs). Also, Paul is obviously a dedicated host and very timely and thorough communicator! We will definitely look to rebook here, it is an excellent value! ❤️"
3836973,220527146,2017-12-22,35037700,Jen,Our family enjoyed our short visit to Monterey and appreciated that the house was close to the aquarium and Asilomar beach (beautiful sunset!).
3836973,221799731,2017-12-27,3420935,Arvind,"Paul is a super host! Quick responses, accurate detailed instructions, and flexible where possible. Paul’s house is located in an awesome location, 5 min drive to the aquarium ... 15 min to beautiful Carmel beach. We had a great time. Thanks Paul!"
3836973,222423081,2017-12-29,26358772,Bruce,Good place. Comfortable for my family. A bit smaller than expected and pretty expensive for what it is (maybe higher because it was 12/27 and 28).
3836973,223753415,2018-01-01,122098969,Hallie,"Great place to stay in Pacific Grove! Comfortable for a group, great patio and outdoor space. Paul was an excellent host who provided great recommendations for the area and was easy to communicate with prior to arrival and during our stay.  Would definitely recommend to friends and would stay again."
3836973,224900867,2018-01-04,106317687,Susan,"Great location near 17 mile drive, beaches and Monterey."
3836973,226428280,2018-01-10,14923354,Annalisa,"My big group and I (in total 8 people) enjoyed every minute spent at Paul's house. The house is beautiful, sparkling clean, and located  in a beautiful area. Paul is an outstanding host. I wouldn't hesitate to go back."
3836973,227414570,2018-01-14,9605979,Charu,"Paul is an awesome host. He made sure we had all the details before our trip, offered us local tips and was very accommodative of check-in and check-out times. That was especially helpful as we were travelling with a toddler and an infant and mostly on their schedule. The house  is centrally located and close to major attractions. We loved using the backyard, although would have been great to have a fireplace or a heater to enjoy an after dinner wine or early morning coffee :) "
3836973,229818215,2018-01-25,32825562,Susan,"This is a lovely house. We were three adults and each of our rooms was comfortable. Sometimes the other bedrooms child oriented, but this house was not. It's attractive but comfortable. The garden area is very nice although it was a bit nippy outside to make much use of it. We would return here again. Paul is a good host and you won't be disappointed."
3836973,232411489,2018-02-04,77025513,Leo,Great location. Clean and spacious. Great outdoor space.  Great hospitality.
3836973,234168665,2018-02-11,80963160,Maria,Paul is an amazing host.  Communication was outstanding and truly helped set expectations.  We also appreciated all the wonderful suggestions and tips leading up to our stay.  This really helped us be prepared and wonderfully excited for our trip.  This was a special trip for our family and we appreciate Paul's efforts to help make it exactly that - a trip filled with special memories.
3836973,236668496,2018-02-19,12029481,Vyjayanthi,Paul’s place is very close to Monterey Bay Aquarium and 17 mile drive. It’s very well located if you want to visit Asilomar Beach. It’s big enough for 6 adults. I enjoyed the detailed directions given by Paul and liked that he’s only literally a text away.
3836973,237138461,2018-02-21,23243828,Adam,"Great property in amazing location. Accurately described and Paul is a fantastic host, responds quickly and a pleasure to communicate with. Very comfortable for 4 adults and 2 babies. Close to every thing you want to see and do in the area. Would book again."
3836973,238484390,2018-02-25,89858265,Rebecca,"Came to celebrate my son's birthday and we wanted or whole family to be able to stay together; we could not have asked for a better place! From tips and recommendations ahead of time to quick responses,  Paul went above and beyond. The house kitchen is well stocked with necessary supplies and hopefully the next time we stay out will be warm enough to enjoy the patio! Paul was asking/providing us with additional accommodations even before we knew we would need them. I highly recommend this house!"
3836973,242925558,2018-03-13,58762287,Christa,"Almost 300 excellent reviews can't be wrong! They aren't!
This is a great home in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Centrally located, you can reach pretty much everything on foot if you choose to.
The host is very responsive, helpful, he answers quickly, check-in and check-out procedures are thoroughly explained.
The home is comfortable and clean, and the kitchen well stocked. Loved the back yard, unfortunately it was cold any rainy during our stay so we didn't use ist much. The five of us (all adults) had plenty of room to spread out so we wouldn't get on top of each other."
3836973,244452257,2018-03-18,33615618,Jared,"Great home! Wife and I took all four kids (9, 6, 4, 3) to the Monterey Peninsula and stayed at this house. It was one of the kid's birthdays, AND my wife's. An important time! Paul provided tons of ideas for fun stuff for the kids. The house has lots of nice extras that you don't always get (completely stocked kitchen, snacks, shampoo...) I really appreciated him and would definitely stay there again."
3836973,244845437,2018-03-19,108312839,Rungroj,"Nice, Beautiful and Great Location"

His home was spotless, and we thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous backyard in between the late March rain showers. It was really the ideal spot for my family during our family reunion, and I wouldn't hesitate to book again. Thank you, Paul, for everything!!"
3836973,247776230,2018-03-29,126833572,Wei,Paul is a so helpfull host.He send lots of  good suggestions before we arrive and that really help us a lot!

3836973,250347260,2018-04-04,89476854,晓璐,"Paul’s house is so warm so cozy. Carmel and Monterey is worth for staying for days on HWY 1,then Paul’s house is absolutely just the best home choice."
3836973,250606693,2018-04-05,174778044,Jiang,"房子非常干净,地理位置也很好,周围有餐厅、超市,非常方便,房东非常热心,会为你介绍许多景色优美的地方等等,房子设施齐全,非常适合度假居住"

We came with a toddler, a 4 year old and 2 seniors.all of us enjoyed out time here. 
Paul was very responsive and caring.  He even checked in with me to make sure my parents checked into the premise okay. (I arrived a day later than they did)."
3836973,251884819,2018-04-08,178030552,Kenia,"Paul is a great host and his home was great for our group of 6.  Plenty of space and so close to everything it made so simple to catch an Uber to just about anywhere.  

I’m saving this place as a favorite."
3836973,253226052,2018-04-13,10194533,Gina,"Great location, comfy beds, and absolutely outstanding host.  Paul was wonderful.  He was very quick with all responses and had great suggestions of local things to do from hiking trails to restaurants and other activities.  We tried every suggestion he made and had a wonderful stay.  

The house is in a great proximity to grocery stores (walkable), hiking trails, and restaurants.   And the backyard is gorgeous!  My only complaint is that sometimes the street the house is facing can be noisy when a loud motorcycle drives by but it was quiet at night.  We had no trouble sleeping and the master bedroom faces the back of the house so it is even more quiet.  Also, may need a stronger internet signal as it doesn't reach the back of the house as well and was very slow at night.  Though it did not affect the streaming capabilities when we watched netflix or amazon prime."
3836973,254111385,2018-04-15,14991633,Beth,"Paul quickly and thoughtfully responded to all my messages; he was an excellent host. Check-in was a breeze.

4099680,22925857,2014-11-17,23189780,Allyson,"Anne was welcoming from our very first contact. The house was perfectly pulled together with every detail thought through. It was a great location for us between Monetary and Camel just minutes to the most beautiful beaches and quaint down town Pacific Grove. 
The house was perfect for our weekend away. "
4099680,23332836,2014-11-29,4205251,Joannie,"We found Anne to be very polite, friendly and easy to communicate with. She provided us with lots of useful information and instructions. The Monarch Home is spacious, clean and comfortable - the 5 of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! The home is thoughtfully equipped with everything you could want/need. The living room is beautifully decorated and the outdoor space is quiet and perfect for having your morning coffee. Location is also excellent - Pacific Grove is quite the hidden gem! "
4099680,24169877,2014-12-21,24988833,Shubham,Really Cute place close to some breathtaking scenery. Extremely well-organized and very welcoming at first sight. Anne made sure that our stay was refreshing. We spent the whole evening in the house playing card games and feeling as if we were at one of our homes. It truly felt like Home away from Home. Anne was also very flexible with the check-in and check-out times.
4099680,24309546,2014-12-25,18775916,Roman,"We spend Christmas with my wife and our two boys, Ashini welcomed us like family members. We had wonderfull times in such a wonderfull place! Thank you for this beautyfull moments.

4099680,24740640,2015-01-02,23482205,Dawn,"The Monarch Home was a lovely place to stay. It was walking distance from the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary and downtown shops. The home was immaculate, well-organized, and welcoming. The pillows and linens were cozy and left our family feeling rested. Touches of class were visible throughout the home such as the décor, selection of personal products, and ready to go cake & coffee upon our arrival. Bonus, there was a back street to this home that was quiet and our family spent time sitting out on the patio furniture and having a catch of football. This was my first time through the Airbnb process and the host was patient, informative, and kind. Plus, the host was gracious and prompt with our questions and requests.  I highly recommend this property and host for future rentals!"
4099680,25250268,2015-01-10,23625353,Teresa,We had a wonderful time. The house was beautiful just as described. It was very relaxing from the moment we arrived. I would highly recommend.
4099680,25552668,2015-01-19,19363286,Linda,"Anne was really responsive and ensured we were taken care of.  Although she was not present and was traveling, she was reachable and provided all information in the area.  She's a great, virtual hostess!  

She provided very comprehensive information from tourist to emergency information.  Anne thought of everything that one may need.  

Her home is extremely beautiful, well kept, and provided many amenities (in case you forget any).  Love the place and would definitely go back."
4099680,25679977,2015-01-23,8311942,Sarah,"Anne was an excellent host, great at communicating. The house is lovely and impeccably clean, the beds are comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet and close to the beach and Asilomar conference center.

4099680,25775963,2015-01-25,17556781,Reese,"The Monarch Home is just as described. It's beautifully put together, cozy, and immaculately clean. We had a group of 5 that stayed only one night and found the house to be the perfect stopover point on our way further south. Anne was a great host, very responsive and gave great tips on the surrounding area. The coffee and breakfast supplies were a nice touch as well! I would certainly stay here again and hope to do so on my next trip to the Monterey Peninsula."
4099680,26005877,2015-02-01,6927297,David,"The Monarch Home was a wonderful place to spend the weekend! Extremely comfortable, well-equipped, and in a lovely area.  Anne was extremely helpful in arranging the booking and making sure that we had everything we needed. Very highly recommended."

4099680,26529915,2015-02-15,3610983,Libby,"The Monarch Home hosted by Anne was everything and more than we  could have expected. It was generously appointed with many things that were above expectations, in all areas, the kitchen, the bath, the living space, the neighborhood, all of which directly reflects the values Anne brings to this home. Thank you so very much for your attention, generosity, and comfortable home. The beds and bedding were superb!"
4099680,27087843,2015-02-25,3713188,Susan,"Staying at the Monarch House was truly like being at home. It is well furnished with great comfort in the beddings (with extra as needed). It is equipped with items so that running to the store immediately is a weight off after arriving. The bathroom and kitchen had items which I did not expect, definitely were more than a hotel and added a large benefit to staying here. The photos on line are perfect. Anne is attentive, communicates extremely well and available (I did not know how to work the air mattress so was able to get in contact immediately). There are notes around the house to assist and a detailed notebook for the stay. It is a fantastic location to many locations in the area. Do try some of the recommendations in the notebook. It is in a wonderful and safe location with space for parking plus a washer/dryer. This was definitely one of the best stays I have had. Fantastic place with nice comfortable furnishings. Thank you Anne for being an excellent host!"
4099680,27281430,2015-03-01,27549519,Patrick,"The house was very nice and walkable to the beach. I even walked to the aquarium, though that took half an hour so it might not be the best for families. Anne was very accommodating; she got in contact a couple times before our trip to coordinate, and hand-delivered an iPad that one of us had left behind. I would recommend this house to anyone looking for something in this location and price range."
4099680,27647195,2015-03-09,26165417,Margaret,"The Monarch House was extremely comfortable, well equipped and clean. It was well located and the host made every effort to make our stat pleasant."
4099680,27791439,2015-03-12,3549678,William,"What a warm, cozy, comfortable place to call home. Close to the Monterey Bay Aquarium (the host offers two free passes), Pebble Beach, Monarch Butterfly reserve, and the beauty of the California coast.

Well equipped, well stocked and well appointed. High speed internet and big screen TV, plus luxurious towels and very, very comfortable beds. A caring, but not intrusive host, added to the pleasure."
4099680,28143759,2015-03-18,5166844,Elizabeth,"Staying in the Monarch home was everything that I had hoped for and wanted.  My mother was visiting and originally we had thought to stay in Carmel.  We found the perfect situation at The Monarch Home in Pacific Grove where we were perfectly situated in between Carmel and Monterey.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and conveniently located to the beach, town, etc.

Anne is FABULOUS hostess!  She is attentive to your needs, communicates clearly/is quick to respond, and has lots of helpful advice always. The house is well appointed, clean, organized, and a pleasant place to be.

I highly recommend The Monarch Home for your Monterey Peninsula stay."
4099680,28314835,2015-03-22,27134003,Jeffrey,"The house was extremely clean, with helpful notes and labels so we could find everything we needed right away.

4099680,28579629,2015-03-26,5191229,Danil,"This place has totally exceeded our expectations - very clean, neatly organized and comfortable. We had a 7 month old daughter with us; and the host provided  us with a portable crib for her. We would definitely recommend it for families. 

The house is very well equipped (especially the kitchen), so I would recommend to check with the host if you consider bringing some appliances with you. Everything in the house was in a perfect condition. 

Anne was very responsive to our questions and requests. In addition, the place is full of labels, which helped to follow house rules and would resolve half of your questions before you asked Anne.

We absolutely loved our stay in this house and would definitely be back in the future! Thank you, Anne!"
4099680,28939335,2015-04-01,26993792,Jill,"Anne was a wonderful hostess.  She was very responsive to all of our questions, including providing information about local basketball courts for our son.  We felt very much at home in the clean, welcoming Monarch home.    Anne attended to many details in the home that made our stay so much easier...she provided items such as a cooler and ice pack,  laundry detergent, coffee filters, basic meal preparation supplies, lotion, etc.  These are things I have not found in other homes and would not expect, yet they made a big difference in our stay.  The neighborhood was friendly and quiet, yet conveniently located to the top attractions of the Monterey peninsula area.   The aquarium tickets were a real bonus!  What a savings that was for us!  I would recommend this home to my friends.  Thank-you Anne!"
4099680,29299008,2015-04-06,28783904,Karbo,"Anne was incredibly responsive to all my questions and requests. She was an amazing hostess. I was here ""entertaining"" my mother in law and it was a great success. The place is very kid-friendly: baskets of toys and children's books in the living room for my 2.5 year old, baby cot for my 2 month old! Definitely will return to this lovely home when we visit Monterey area again!"
4099680,29572881,2015-04-09,3028599,Julia,"I stayed at the Monarch Home for two nights with my 11 year old son and my 81 year old parents last week. We wanted to explore Big Sur and the coast in the area. Anne's home was clean, inviting, user-friendly and her kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. The beds were super-comfy and there was enough room for us all to spread out. She left helpful notes for us everywhere, and was available by phone and email with almost instant response rates. The neighborhood in Pacific Bay is quiet and fairly conveniently located to to the Montarey Aquarium (we walked there in about 30 minutes) and Big Sur a 45 minute or so drive. We didn't make it to Pebble Beach, but Spanish Bay and another beautiful beach (can't remember the name) were a 5 minute drive. Unless you are a jogger or active walker, you may need a car to get to the beach, and to local restaurants and shopping, but overall it was easy for us to get everywhere we had planned to visit."
4099680,29734382,2015-04-12,27380180,Susanna,"The house was in the perfect location for our visit.  Everything was very comfortable and cozy.  Anne was fabulous to deal with.  Every detail was thought of and she was in contact the entire time to make sure all of our needs were covered.  I would love to come back and stay for a week.  I went for a beautiful run out the front door down the 17 mile drive, perfect.  Walking distance to so many beautiful spots.    "
4099680,30043768,2015-04-16,16537776,Joshua,"We had a very good experience. Anne, our host, was extremely attentive. The house was spacious, well located, and included anything/everything you'd need. Plus, the two passes to the Aquarium make it a great value overall. We'd surely come back to stay!"
4099680,30198304,2015-04-19,25719689,Zoltan,"Wonderful, responsive hosts. Very nice 2BR + 2BA house in a residential neighborhood in Pacific Grove.  We were near shopping and restaurants (all within a couple of miles): ate at Passionfish (on Lighthouse Ave) and at Vito's (on Forest Ave).  The cool nights and foggy mornings were wonderful. It was also fun to see three deer munching on the bushes in the morning and several racoons scurrying around at night.
We visited Monterey for the 2015 Sea Otter Classic (bike festival, races, expo), as two adults and three teenagers. The two boys used one of the bedrooms, parents the other one, and our teenage daughter slept on living room sofa (we did not use the air mattress available). The garage was also utilized, we stored a couple of mountain bikes after the races - this was a great amenity for us!
Bed and bedding were comfortable: we slept really well!  Lots of instructions around the house, all the cupboards, cabinets, doors were labeled for the guests.  Everything was spotless clean! The bathrooms were nicely appointed and supplied (shampoo, body wash, etc), better than in a lot of hotels. 
Our hosts really surprised us with the kitchen and refrigerator fully stocked with breakfast items (eggs, bread, orange juice, milk, butter, cereal).  This made the kids very happy in the morning, and worked well for the parents as well!  We hope to return to the Monarch House some day for a longer stay!
"
4099680,30465998,2015-04-22,359179,Cemre,"Great location, great amenities, really well-kept and well-stocked. Checkin experience was smooth and we felt like taken care of really well.

The one downside: the pictures don't reflect how spacious the house is! The living room was huge, both bedrooms were full-sized and there were two full bathrooms. Almost needs a floorplan! :)"
4099680,30661383,2015-04-26,22029523,Tim,"

We stayed in this beautiful house the night before Big Sur International Marathon 2015. When we opened the door, the first impression was like ""wow! This place is super clean!"" Then we kept having surprises from the kitchen to the bathroom, from the living room to the bedroom. Everything was beyond our expectations. We didn't have a chance to meet Anne unfortunately, but from the way she communicated with me, I can tell she is filled with love and joy. She thinks and acts to the very details for the tenants. I would definitely recommend this house to anyone that loves to stay in a place better than 4 star hotels. This is a five star home! We have already decided to come back for two nights next year. "
4099680,30915314,2015-04-28,31947617,Mario,"What a lovely home away from home! My wife kept finding little touches, and kept saying ""why yes, I DO need that!"" Anne was responsive, helpful, hospitable, yet gave us our privacy. I would not hesitate at all to go back, and I can not recommend Anne's home enough! From the local recommendations, to the supplies that are all perfectly labeled, to being super responsive for any and all questions ... it was a wonderful experience!!!!"
4099680,31164463,2015-05-03,26222051,Marta,The Monarch Home was just as posted.  We had a lovely time in a lovely home.  We're sorry that it was such a quick trip and didn't get a chance to truly enjoy the home.  We would like to stay again.
4099680,31824454,2015-05-10,137847,Hagar,"The Monarch Home is wonderful! Anne is a spectacular host! Staying at the Monarch Home feels like staying at the guest home of a dear friend that deeply cares about you and wants you to have an amazing stay. The house is lovely and immaculately clean. While we didn't have the pleasure of meeting her in person, Anne provided extremely clear communications via text/e-mail and there are instructions throughout the home to help you easily make the the most of all of the amenities and local treasures. The aquarium passes are quite the treat, in addition to free admission, they also let you skip the long line for buying tickets so you can head straight into the aquarium. There are dozens of thoughtful touches around the home to make your stay comfortable including a well-stocked kitchen where we prepared lovely brunches. This is a wonderful way to spend quality time with family. Thank you, Anne!  "
4099680,31942899,2015-05-12,7291509,Ashwin,"We stayed at the Monarch home for a couple of nights in May. We had a wonderful experience. Anne really knows what she is doing. She is thorough with communication and information (via text and email both!), though you really don't need to contact her because everything you need to know can be found in little handwritten notes and memos across the home. The house itself is beautiful, cozy and very welcoming. We wish we could've stayed longer. One of the highlights of our stay was deer sighting - They were two of them grazing in the front yard !!!"
4099680,32461990,2015-05-18,3239213,Ricardo,"Great house, spotless, well organized home.  Anne was great to deal with and communicated well.  Our 14
month old granddaughter loved the toys and books."
4099680,32689363,2015-05-20,12972443,Zhiming,"It was like a perfect stay at Anne's home. As guests, my parents and I really enjoyed the moment together. "
4099680,32963704,2015-05-24,5321102,Alissa,"The Monarch House was a great place to stay!  The house is very clean and well-stocked with kitchen and bathroom amenities.  The bedding is very clean and comfortable as well.  While we did not get to meet Anne in person, she was a great host and very responsive to any questions both before we arrived and during the stay.  The house also contained tons of information for local food, activities, sight-seeing tours, etc.  I highly recommend the Monarch House to anyone looking for a vacation in or near Monterey, Pebble Beach or the surrounding areas."
4099680,33359896,2015-05-27,4995232,Fernando," Staying at the Monarch House was a wonderful experience. The location was superb to explore the beautiful Monterey and surrounding areas. Anne was so thoughtful, resourceful and organized. We could not have a better host!"
4099680,33536695,2015-05-29,4287952,Andrew,"Excellent communication with Anne from start to finish. All instructions about the property were clear and we really enjoyed our stay. The property is ideally located in Pacific Grove, near quaint shops for dinner and groceries, and also at the start of 17 mile drive. The main reason for our vacation was to visit the aquarium so the 2 adult tickets were a bonus. Aquarium is a short drive away. If we were to visit Monterey area again then we would definitely try and stay here!"
4099680,33681274,2015-05-31,19410115,Tricia,"From the wonderfully stocked kitchen to the extra comfy beds, our girls weekend at the Monarch Home was exactly what we were hoping for. Anne is an extremely welcoming and helpful host. The house could not have felt more warm and inviting! We would not hesitate to stay here again for another amazing weekend in Monterey!"
4099680,34943586,2015-06-14,7963006,De-Laine,The Monarch Home was perfect - ideally located for a conference at Asilomar as well as exploring the area.  Anything you could need in the house was provided.  Deer are all over the neighborhood - I saw some every day.  There were even a couple outside in the yard while I was preparing dinner one night!  Anne was very helpful and made sure we knew how to contact her if needed.  Delightful stay - will definitely return!
4099680,35458252,2015-06-19,8442738,Viktor,We had a great stay. Lovely area. Well equipped house in a perfect location for exploring the surrondings. Anne was a great and well organized host and responded quickly to the few questions we had. We would be happy to return.
4099680,36359750,2015-06-28,22110083,Maria,"We had a great time at the Monarch home, and Anne was a superhost! Nice, quite and very clean. We would love to stay again!"
4099680,36767126,2015-07-01,2593233,Noveena,"The Monarch Home is perfect for us as a family with little kid and teenager. The house is clean, comfy and nice arrangement. The bed is so comfortable and the linen is very nice.  Completed kitchen utensil makes easy for us to cook dinner or breakfast. U can find variation of tea , coffee and hot chocolate.

Anne is like a mom caring for her children hahahah and u want to be at her house where everything is taken care clean and notes is everywhere to make everything easy to use. And the Aquarium Pass is totally a bonus since a pass is usd 40 per adult.

Thank u Anne for a beautiful house, fully recomended. I will comeback there if I have a chance. God Bless."
4099680,36853318,2015-07-02,22120834,Kate,"Anne was a fantastic host and did everything possible to give us the maximum time to enjoy ourselves when we got to her house. It was a perfect base to explore the local area. Within walking distance of shops and cafes and a little longer walk to the Aquarium and downtown Monterey. 
Her house was really lovely with 2 bright bedrooms, a very pretty dining kitchen and a spacious living room. An added bonus was definitely the 2 bathrooms, which was ideal for us as we were two couples. 
The passes for the Aquarium were really useful and the information Anne left was also incredibly helpful. I would highly recommend Anne and her home to anyone. "
4099680,37145538,2015-07-05,30612121,Grace,"非常非常棒的一次体验,房东的房间一应俱全,归纳整齐。周边很安静,离海滩很近"
4099680,37873965,2015-07-11,4244411,Natalie,"The house is spacious, clean and gorgeously decorated.  Check-in and out was a breeze, and Anne was extremely helpful and organized.  The kitchen was stocked with lots of extras which was greatly appreciated for our short 2 day stay.  And my 3 year old loved the basket of books, too.  Not only would I highly recommend this property and host, I don't think we will stay anywhere else in the area!  "
4099680,38696571,2015-07-18,28720626,Megan,"The Monarch Home could not have been more lovely and more perfect for our family's visit to the Monterey Bay area. The house is cute, extremely clean, and very functional. The house is in a great location in residential PG. It's about 0.8 miles to the beach, which was a bit too far for us to walk with our toddler and gear but a quick 3 minute drive. SO easy and so convenient. The house backs to a little alley road that runs along a gorgeous, wooded park. Anne was exceptional. Despite managing the house from afar, she is very responsive, answered all our questions quickly, offered great restaurant advice when requested, and checked in to see if there was anything we needed. Instructions are provided electronically and posted throughout the house, and she has truly thought of everything. She was a fabulous host. The day we got there was unseasonably warm, and the house (no AC) was a bit stuffy - she made some quick calls and offered to get us a box fan to cool things down, going above and beyond to keep us comfortable. Turned out once the weather cooled down and we opened all the windows, the house temperature hovered at a blissful upper 60s all week. It was lovely. The house had everything - literally - that we needed. Forget that toddlers are slippery when wet in the bathtub? No problem - a rubbery bath mat is there and ready! Have an unexpected need for lady supplies? No worries - they're in the cabinet under the sink! Run out of toothpaste? Covered! Forget a beach hat? There are 3! The washer and dryer are very new, and we ended up using them twice. There's no dishwasher, but washing dishes leisurely while looking out the picture window at the family of deer that frequents the grounds multiple times a day was enjoyable. The beds are comfy. The fridge and cabinets are stocked with tons of food to which guests are welcome. The living room is a great place to settle in with a book - the windows are huge and you may as well be outside! The tables on the front step and back deck are great places to have a snack or just chill out. Some quick notes: If you're looking for a snazzy, new, and modern place with all the luxuries of a hotel, this isn't your place (and that's not what we wanted anyway). But if you want to stay in a quaint, adorable, little house and pretend that you live here, this is it!!! Bring ear plugs and a face mask if you're a sensitive sleeper since the front of the house is on a road that seems to get a decent amount of traffic. Not a problem at all, just a word of advice for other families staying at Anne's AMAZING home! We can't thank you enough, Anne. We had the most wonderful experience at your home and hope to be..."
4099680,39596378,2015-07-25,26967103,Renee,Anne was a perfect host. She checked in during our stay to make sure everything was going well. She provided a book with information on everything in the area. She also made it clear that she was only a phone call away.
4099680,39901799,2015-07-27,11077430,Steen,"We stayed at this fantastic place for 2 days and was so fortunate to experience the festival of the laternes in pacific grove .
Anne is a fantastic host and replies very quickly on emails and text messages. She has created a cosy home in a great location (my boys enjoyed the Ball park nearby).
House was perfect for us, very clean and had a lot of wonderful details .
We wishes we could have stayed longer "
4099680,41059556,2015-08-04,27042497,Tom,"Anne has a beautiful give that is close to everything in Pacific Grove. At just a quick text away, Anne is readily available to answer any questions, although you won't have many as she has thought of almost everything. "
4099680,41530941,2015-08-07,40323737,Joe,"My wife and I brought our two toddlers to Monarch Home and had a truly wonderful experience. Anne has really set everything up so that you can walk right in and get down to the serious business of relaxing. Everything you need is there, is labeled, is meticulously clean, and makes you feel immediately at home. Great location for roaming around the Monterey peninsula, seemingly close to, well, everything. The two adult passes to the aquarium were like icing on the cake. My kids even discovered Lincoln Logs in the basket of kids toys, yet another example of Anne's fantastic attention to detail that helps make this spot so wonderful. This is truly a space that made us feel like we were in our own 2nd home. We definitely want to return to Monarch Home! And, beyond the home itself, Anne is a such a communicative and thoughtful host, it makes the administrative work of checking in and checking out of the space a breeze. This was our very first Airbnb stay and I have to say that Anne has set the bar very high all around! "
4099680,41744619,2015-08-09,15139659,John,House was exactly as described.  Very nice and comfortable and well equipped.  Very roomy and extremely comfortable beds.
4099680,42440370,2015-08-13,39249471,Linda,"We had a wonderful time at the Monarch House. Our kids aged 5,7 asked if this was our new home. We walked to Asilomar Beach, and walked all over Pacific Grove. What a great location! The house was just beautiful, great for the kids. The special touches were so thoughtful. In typical mom fashion, I forgot body wash, and thankfully Anne had provided some. Don't hesitate to stay here, the aquarium passes originally were the reason we booked the monarch house, but now it will be our number one spot. Thanks Anne!"
4099680,43519836,2015-08-20,4266550,Will,"Anne was not there to greet us in person, but our stay exemplified hospitality in every way.  My wife and I felt relaxed the moment we got inside.  We appreciated the nice couches, the large washer and dryer, and the well-supplied kitchen.  The kids (4 and 1 y.o.) enjoyed the books, games, and large basket of Lincoln logs in the living room.  At night, I noticed that the bedding did not cause me to feel allergic, which is a bit unusual in other people's houses — this place is apparently more than superficially clean.  I don't know how many people Anne could have counted on to notice the difference, but I was certainly grateful for many a good night's rest.  In our 4 days there, we saw the aquarium, Point Lobos, Elkhorn Slough, and many local beaches.  The house was a very convenient distance to all of these things."
4099680,43904255,2015-08-23,29568672,Claire,"la maison est dans un quartier très résidentiel et calme.
et correspond parfaitement aux photos.
Anne a partagé des sms et message via airBnB avec toutes précisions utiles. on se sentait vraiment attendus.
dans la maison tout est parfaitement propre et Anne a laissé des instruction partout ou c'était utile. 
le plus : un frigo plein de produits à utiliser pour le petit déjeuner. 
des petits gâteaux de bienvenue , on se sent chez des amis. 
la décoration est très agréable , les fauteuils super confortables est les lits extraordinaires.

"
4099680,44328300,2015-08-25,2654962,Stephanie,"I booked the Monarch Home for my in-laws while they were touring the area. Anne was fantastic to communicate with--extremely responsive, helpful, clear, and detailed. She offered to communicate directly with my in-laws, which was extremely thoughtful, and she did a great job managing the three-way logistics/communications.

My in-laws really enjoyed their stay. They also felt very much taken care of and that Anne went out of her way to make sure  everything went well. Anne provided them with very thorough, detailed information before and during their visit. The house was perfectly located for the sight-seeing they did (the aquarium, 17-mile drive, etc.), and it was clean, well-appointed, and exactly as described. The Aquarium passes were a great bonus too. There were three adults and two children in the group, and they were all very happy and comfortable. 

I highly recommend both the Monarch Home and Anne! "
4099680,44529774,2015-08-27,29980904,Delia,"We LOVED our stay at Anne's home.  We felt so welcome. There was plenty of room for our family of five.  The house had spices, condiments, milk, cereal and more. It was like staying at a relatives house that wanted to make sure you were comfortable and happy.   It far exceeded my expectations.  "
4099680,45685347,2015-09-05,9699639,Adam,"We had an unforgettable trip to Monterey and Big Sur and loved staying in the Monarch Home during our visit.  Anne seems to have thought of everything, and her home is incredibly clean and well appointed with all that a traveler could want.  We certainly took advantage of the aquarium passes, as well as other recommendations for local sights.  If you are a first time visitor to the area, this would be an ideal place to stay as Anne has amassed a wealth of tourism information.  And the home is conveniently located for many points of interest.  It would also be fantastic for families, as there are two bathrooms, games, and a washer/dryer.  We highly recommend staying here!"
4099680,45926639,2015-09-07,29006665,Charles,"We visited The Monarch Home (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) . We had a marvelous time, and the home is a perfect place for a home base from which to see local sights and events. Pacific Grove is small, quiet, and the house is right on the edge of a nice park that gives a rustic feeling, with wildlife, and good walking trails.

The house itself is simple on the outside, but is very well appointed inside, with two separate bedrooms each with its own bathroom. Anne, our host, offers so many amenities, it's hard to remember them all, but the refrigerator was well stocked with various basic foods and condiments, as were the cupboards. There were numerous up-to-date brochures, maps, and event listings that helped us to find our way around Pacific Grove and Monterey. She provides complimentary tickets to the Monterey Aquarium, though we did not have a chance to use these.

Another big PLUS is that Anne is very attentive to the lodgers, with detailed instructions in advance and during our stay as to what to expect and how to check in and out. She showed real interest in our comfort and in our having a fine experience in her home. The living areas are stocked with local materials and lots of books and magazines, and lots of books and toys for the kids, if you have them.

In general, we we very (!) happy with this rental, and we would definitely recommend it to others, and would be happy to return ourselves in future.

As a final note, we especially liked how the home was stocked and how much attention Anne gave to our stay -- from notes and instructions and information sheets and maps in the house to several texts and emails to us prior to, during, and after our stay. She really showed that she cared and placed our welfare as a high priority. We appreciate all that immensely!"
4099680,46333940,2015-09-09,7090761,Ronjon,Extremely relaxing location.  My parents first AirBnB and they loved it!  Everything clearly labeled.  Quiet home away from home.  Perfect location to explore the region.  Many thanks!
4099680,46879137,2015-09-14,10590952,Ashley,"Anne's home was amazing! We had 4 people and it was the perfect size for all of us to feel comfortable and not squished! The location is PERFECT..seriously! A little off the main strip but close enough to everything in Pacific Grove and Monterey.

Anne was very sweet and easy to communicate with. House was equipped with all necessities and even cookies for the guests. Loved the modern style of the home and key-less entry door locks."
4099680,47161464,2015-09-16,38486601,Claire,"This is an exceptional place to stay. It's a lovely, clean, light and comfortable house and convenient for Monterey. Anne has paid attention to every detail to make a visitor's stay easier and was really proactive and helpful in communication. The aquarium tickets are a lovely touch. I only wish we'd been able to stay longer, and give it more than 5 stars."
4099680,47730283,2015-09-21,11047842,Johanne,"The Monarch Home is so far one of my favorite detonations! The house was clean and the location was awesome. Amenities provided were plentiful and made the stay pleasant. Anne is an amazing host, she is quick with communicating and accommodated to my family's needs.

My only suggestion to people who are not from here is to arrive early! There isn't so much lighting here at night, street signs are hard to see at night. "
4099680,48079200,2015-09-23,8005015,Susan,"We really enjoyed our visit to Pacific Grove, Anne's house is lovely, spacious and spotlessly clean. It's a great location, close to the beach and the shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove, be sure to borrow the torch if you walk into town in the evening! Having passes to the aquarium is a real bonus, it's an absolute must for any visit to Monterey. Just wish we could return again soon."
4099680,49215407,2015-10-02,33608536,Peter,"This was an ideal experience. House was spotless. Everything was provided as listed and more! It was a great location, quiet but close to everything we wanted to do. We were 2 couples and it was perfect."
4099680,50060974,2015-10-09,29079453,Lance,"The Monarch Home was fantastic.  Ideally located to walk to Asilomar for a meeting and to downtown for the restaurants.  The house is very comfortable and well decorated.  The host, Anne, was very attentive and provided everything we needed.  The beds are very comfortable.  The passes to the Aquarium came in handy.  You can avoid the lines by going to the members entrance on the side.  That saved us an hour of waiting.  Excellent choice.  Would stay here again.  Thanks Anne. "

Also there are two guest passes for the Aquarium. The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, plates etc.. and was very convenient for us to cook dinner (we had two young kids and eating out can be a challenge). The rooms have large comfortable beds and also there is a foldable baby crib (it has a waterproof blanket to put on top of the pad, but would recommend to bring your own crib sheet). There are two bathrooms and a nice living room area. Very family friendly place and very comfortable. Will definitely go back again!"
4099680,51127899,2015-10-18,36004379,Amanda,"A friend and I came for a girls getaway and reserved the Monarch House.  The home has everything you need and is well located for trips to Monterey, Carmel and Pebble Beach.  It is in a quiet neighborhood and was great to come home to after long days out in the surrounding areas.  I'd definitely recommend the Monarch home. "

The attention to detail was evident throughout the immaculately clean, well stocked and beautifully decorated home.  We appreciated the little informational notes prepared by the owner.  We will definitely return."
4099680,51899282,2015-10-25,40910777,Chip,"This was our first AirBnB experience, so we can't compare to other stays, but a few things that were great about Anne's place were: 
     1. It was spotlessly clean - no exaggeration. If we lived in the area, we'd definitely want the name of her cleaning woman!  2. The house was incredibly well stocked with foods like cereal, butter, jams, coffee, teas, and tons of other stuff.  3. We like a warm house, and the heat worked very well.  4. Communication with Anne was very easy and her replies extremely prompt with real concern for the quality of our experience.  5. Very nice to walk across the street and see the Monarch butterflies resting on their migration.
     We were here for a very busy wedding weekend, and so not ""home"" much at all. The house was absolutely perfect for us in this, and a huge value compared to local hotels. If we returned to Monterey for something similar, we would definitely stay here again.  It is a comfortable, friendly family home in a suburban/convenient neighborhood. If we were looking to primarily relax around a house and grounds, we'd go for a luxury home near the oceanfront or in the woods, which would run at least double the cost. But that's for another day. For today, the Monarch House was perfect."
4099680,52295857,2015-10-27,929067,Molly,"It was a wonderful, albeit brief, stay. The house is perfectly located and we'll-appointed. Would stay again!"
4099680,52620823,2015-10-31,1440257,Aneela,The Monarch is a wonderful place to call home! Very close to pacific grove's downtown and ocean views. A short drive to the monterey area. The home is warm & invites relaxation.  Many kid friendly toys and books for the little ones. Its a cross between a bed & breakfast and hotel! The kitchen is well stocked so be sure to check it out before you do groceries! Thanks anne for a gorgeous trip!
4099680,52985385,2015-11-03,45217626,Madhura,We had an excellent trip in the Pacific Grove - Monterey Bay Area. Anne's house is ideal for a quiet time away. The added benefit of having the aquarium passes was ideal. We loved the aquarium. We saw plenty wildlife around the house too - deers and squirrels .. Our 2 yr old loved it. I love how organized the house is and the communication between us has been great during this stay. We will definitely stay here again when we visit the area.
4099680,53323065,2015-11-08,1144619,Gene,"Four of us (two couples) stayed here for the half-marathon weekend and had a great time. Walking distance to lots of food and shops, and everything in the home was orderly and as described. Great spot!"
4099680,53933719,2015-11-14,42947353,J,"The house felt like home as soon as we walked in the door.  There were so many small touches to make us feel pampered.  There were extra toiletries in the bathrooms in case we forgot something.  There were cookies on the table for us.  One of the most amazing things was the information Anne provided to make our stay perfect.  There were many important numbers we might possible need, such as a hospital.  For families with children, this type of information is so reassuring to have while traveling.  There was information on restaurants, grocery stores, tourist attractions and much more.  Along with all of this was personal notes on many of these things, such as the best time to visit the monarch overwintering sanctuary.  The docent, Jack I think, was our best friend after we left.  He spent so much time with us, answered question after question and was generally delightful.   We traveled to Pacific Grove for one reason and found there were so many more reasons to be there!  We know we have to come back and Anne's house is our first choice for accommodations.  

Thank you Anne for making us feel welcome, pampered and help us to enjoy our vacation to the max.  We look forward to visiting again.

Jan and George"

4099680,54613548,2015-11-22,1597468,Michael,"Anne communicate very clearly throughout the booking process and did a fantastic job of making sure the house was ready.  There was even a box of cookies waiting for us after our drive.  The house itself was neat, and well designed and served our purpose perfectly.  Our 2 year old daughter even asked if this was our new home.  A quick walk to the monarch butterflies, and convenient to the Monterey aquarium, Pavel's Backerei, and the beaches.  Overall, a great visit and we would definitely stay here again!"
4099680,54927308,2015-11-25,48684876,Phei,"This is our very first airbnb stay and I must say The Monarch Home scored a lot points for airbnb. I was there with my family - my parents, my hubby and my 2yo, and everyone enjoyed their stay, yes, even my 2yo.  The home is immaculate. I was comfortable to take off my shoes, and let my toddler play on the floor. The home is in a quiet neighborhood with stores and restaurants close by. The aquarium is only 5 minutes drive away. Guest passes to the aquarium is a nice bonus. Anne, you are a great host, and thanks for sharing your lovely home!"
4099680,55098397,2015-11-28,35919579,Erin,"Thank you Anne for allowing us to visit your home!  We had such a great time, making our family thanksgiving just perfect!  The home was even better than I imagined. And the suggestions for things to do were so great!  Thank you so very much!  Already planning a return trip "
4099680,55943216,2015-12-07,3630698,Maryan,"Anne is a Superhost. I give her that moniker even if AirBnb is slow on the uptake on that one. She is friendly, communicative, and welcoming.

We were greeted by Anne and shown some ins and outs about her home. I love it when a place is exactly as advertised and more. 

We (two couples) fully enjoyed our visit and wished we could have stayed longer. It is super comfortable and relaxing.

Anne goes the extra mile to provide a guidebook binder full of information about the surrounding community, including recommendations on restaurants, shops, galleries, and activities. There are 2 free passes available to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which we happily used.

Her attention to detail is wonderful and comforting. We enjoyed every moment we stayed in her cozy home.

Thank you for sharing your home with us, Anne, and we look forward to another visit someday."
4099680,56379254,2015-12-13,11739726,Jan,"We, four women on our annual getaway weekend, had a lovely time at Anne's house.  She thought of everything - from Q-tips in the bathroom, coffee/tea in the kitchen to lots of magazines, games and books in the living room.  Her house was very welcoming ,  spotless and well equipped.  The location is excellent - walking distance to the beach and to town.   Anne provides 2 guest passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which is a wonderful perk.  I hope to return.   "
4099680,56989005,2015-12-20,31305817,Karthik,"The Monarch Home was a great experience for our entire group. Anne communicated clearly and thoroughly the entire booking process, being fast and responsive with any questions that I had. We got to the home Friday after dark, got settled, and enjoyed the rest of our stay. The entire home was clean, pleasantly decorated, and fully loaded with everything we needed. The TV's along with a soundbar in the living room and there's 5G wifi in the home (and Anne's included a bunch of Ethernet cables as well). Anne's thoughtful notes throughout the home with in-house instructions and suggestions for spending time in the city were great. The house is conveniently located near great coastal drives and the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary and just a short drive away from the Aquarium (for which she provides 2 free passes for), Fisherman's Wharf, and Cannery Row. I definitely recommend the house for anyone wanting to stay in the area. Anne and the Monarch Home are great!"
4099680,57635360,2015-12-28,22855008,Richard," Anne stayed in touch with us from the time we booked our trip though our stay. She made sure we had the codes for the door and knew how to reach her in the event of an emergency. The house is very quiet and in a very quiet neighborhood with little car traffic at night.
There is plenty to do in the surrounding area and everything is very accessible. Lots of great restaurants near by and also major super market close by as well.
Rooms are spacious, beds are comfortable and kitchen is well equipped. You could spread out and enjoy the living room. 
Plenty of clean towels and hot water was readily available for showers. Laundry room was very convenient. Parking was also very good, around the back and off the street. "
4099680,57899569,2015-12-30,15283517,Priya,"My family and I had a wonderful time visiting Monterey and staying at the monarch home. The listing was as accurate as it could be. Anne was very accommodating to the extra members in my family, we could walk to the beach from there, visit the cute downtown, go on the 17 mile drive and the 2 free aquarium passes was very generous. Highly recommend this place and would definitely come back again!!!

Everything about The Monarch Home is exactly as described in the listing - if anything, the house is even better in person. We wanted for nothing and were extremely comfortable here and enjoyed our stay so much. Anne provided very detailed and easy to understand instructions about everything in the house and this made our stay so pleasant and relaxed. She was so helpful with suggestions and recommendations about the gorgeous city she clearly loves - we want to move here now! Thank you, Anne! "

The house is beautiful and spacious, and the location is perfect for accessing everything around Monterey.  Will definitely be back."
4099680,59083692,2016-01-06,49727268,Son,"We love staying at Anne's place, which is very lovely, cozy, and private. It’s in a great location as well.  We spent a day in Carmel and watched the sunset over the beach and a second very rainy day at the Monterey Aquarium. Anne communicated clearly and thoroughly the entire booking process, being fast and responsive with any questions that I had.  Anne goes the extra mile to provide a guidebook binder full of information about the surrounding community, including recommendations on restaurants, shops, galleries, farmers market and activities. There is plenty to do in the surrounding area and everything is very accessible. Plenty of clean towels and hot water was readily available for showers. Laundry room was very convenient.

4099680,59996802,2016-01-18,16481465,Janet,"We loved staying at the Monarch Home.  It was perfect for our mini-family reunion.  The home and kitchen are well equipped.  The location is great and convenient.  Anne went out of her way to make sure that our stay was special.  She even checked in regularly with us to see if we needed anything even though she was visiting family in New Zealand.  Her quick responses were just like she was in the area.  It is a comfortable home, very clean, and furnished with high-end bedding and towels like you would find in a luxury hotel.  We would highly recommend a stay at the Monarch Home!"
4099680,60380243,2016-01-23,44363191,Sean,Beautiful cozy home which was appointed with everything we needed during our stay. Anne is an attentive host.
4099680,61028223,2016-01-31,48513405,Anand,"Our family spent a great and relaxing week at the Monarch home. The area is peaceful and quiet, while also being close to the beach and the shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove. The house felt comfortable and cozy, and Anne kept in touch with us to make sure we had everything we needed. The highlight of our trip was seeing thousands of monarch butterflies resting at the butterfly sanctuary, a short walk from the house."
4099680,61433627,2016-02-04,53872220,Alice,"A prime location, walking distance to the monarch butterfly sanctuary, beach trails and downtown pacific grove.  The home has big windows that lend to a light filled inviting, feel.  The kitchen is well equipped for cooking, the bathrooms are stocked with toiletries so you don't have to worry about bringing your own and the beds are super comfy.  Anne had a pac and play crib for my 11 month old to use and age appropriate toys in the living room to entertain him while we relaxed with a glass of wine on the sleek but cozy furniture.  Anne made sure we were enjoying ourselves by texting me on the first day asking if everything was to our liking.  I highly recommend this spot!"

4099680,62341034,2016-02-14,49036601,Mike,Communications with Anne were thorough.  House was exactly as advertised.  Cute neighborhood.  The house is cozy and met our needs.  Kitchen is a little tight so wouldn't want to cook for more than about 6 people.  Would be nice to have a BBQ in back.  Little bit of road noise by bedrooms but didn't bother us much at all.  Loved being able to walk to the monarch Grove and the beach!  Very beautiful surroundings and the home is right in the middle of it all!  And minutes to Carmel too.  Would definitely stay again.
4099680,62852007,2016-02-17,5709819,Luke,"Fantastic stay, Anne is a wonderful host and the house is perfectly laid out for a young family like ours. Thanks for the supply of kids books! The park nearby is great for kiddies too."

4099680,64121548,2016-02-29,10491910,Janum,"My friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Monarch home! The living areas and kitchen were so well-equipped that we felt at home right away: the attention to detail throughout was remarkable. The bedrooms were amazingly comfortable: we slept very well both nights. We also really appreciated having two full bathrooms: it meant we could all be ready and out to see the sights that much quicker.
Anne sent us very informative communications both before and during our stay. Thank you!"
4099680,64636143,2016-03-06,57802890,Sarah,"My friends and I had an absolutely wonderful time staying at Anne's. The house is spacious, comfortable, and in a great location. Every room of the home was so well-furnished and stocked that we felt right at home from the moment we got there. Anne is also a very friendly and attentive host, making sure we had the best trip possible. I'm so happy we chose to stay here and I'd definitely do so again if in the area in the future!  "
4099680,65158566,2016-03-11,3117935,Rachel,"Spotlessly clean and well-equipped, especially the kitchen - great for cooks. Location was excellent.

Anne was a great host &  very thorough in her communications."
4099680,66594744,2016-03-23,62754557,Lisa,This home was spotless!!! We enjoyed how close this home was to everything. Anne was very thorough about the rules and was constantly in touch with us to make sure our stay was wonderful. We will definitely be back to visit again!!!

Upon arrival we found Anne's binder full of information that was helpful in guiding our decisions on how best to spend the little time we had. The home is spotless, very well organized put together with a coastal charm and unique modern flair balanced with vintage touches. We know we will be back. Thanks Anne!  :-)"
4099680,67163850,2016-03-27,2558938,Pei,"We had a fantastic Easter weekend at Anne's house. The house is well located, with many thoughtful details that provides a comfortable home away from home. We absolutely love it. Enjoyed our morning run down on Pico to the coast. Love to come back! "
4099680,67906697,2016-04-01,27330496,Mary,"The house is in a good location in PG. We walked downtown, walked to the beach and to Asilomar. The beds are very comfy with nice down comforters. The house is fully stocked with all the basic staples, spices and paper goods. If you are sensitive to light and sound, bring earplugs and an eye mask. Although Pacific Grove is a small town, 17 mile drive is a busy road and the bedrooms face the road. The curtains in the bedrooms do not block out the car lights as they drive by. "
4099680,68146915,2016-04-02,2118600,Susan,We had such a wonderful time.  Anne's house is very clean and comfortable and in a wonderful place to explore Pacific Grove and Monterey.

Anne always answered my questions and returned my texts so promptly!!
Upon arrival it was exactly as advertised. The place was cute, charming and immaculately kept.
The Aquarium was minutes away as well as downtown.
The neighborhood was quiet and the neighbors friendly. 
Anne was in touch with us throughout the entire weekend making this a most memorable weekend.
Thank you Anne, and we will most definitely be staying at your lovely Monarch home in the future.

4099680,69758200,2016-04-13,7451869,Lisa,"The Monarch Home was far and away one of our nicest experiences in renting a home.  There are a few things that I really appreciate when traveling and renting properties; cleanliness, comfort, and location.  The Monarch home hit a home-run in all three categories! The decor was lovely (Pier 1 stylish, which I love!)  and the kitchen was loaded with quality cookware and utensils - even sharp knives, a cooks dream.  The beds were so comfortable with high quality down comforters and sheets and had a very European  feel.  Anne was an outstanding hostess even though we never met.  She was in continual, easy contact, through texting and email and left all kinds of information in a booklet to help us during our stay.  We were 2 minutes to Lover's Point, 6 minutes to the Aquarium, 2 minutes to the 17 Mile Drive gate, and close to the ocean in every direction.  We were traveling with our kids, ages 3 to 16 and they loved the home too, especially the Lincoln Logs.  All in all, a fabulous experience and I would highly recommend the Monarch home to anyone traveling to Monterrey, Pacific Grove, or Carmel. Thank You Anne! "
4099680,70618819,2016-04-19,46488976,Pat,Great place to stay. Felt like home. Anne's description of the property was very real. There were no surprises and the questions we did have (beach towels and fireplace)  were very well received and quickly responded to. Amazing location between busy Monterey and upscale Carmel. 
4099680,70858459,2016-04-21,9333877,Lu,"We all enjoyed staying Anne home. Everything was great. My little boy also like the toys she provided. Anne is very patient when i have question, and replied me very quick . Thanks! "
4099680,71046791,2016-04-23,33153070,Britt,"We had a wonderful time at Anne's and are already making plans to stay there again. Highlights were the super comfy beds/bedding, superb location within a short drive to all the points of interest in Carmel and Monterey, and all of the extra effort that Anne provided to make her space wonderful for Airbnb guests (super clean space, local info, lots of instructions for how to use things, food, coffee, etc). Hosts like Anne are what make Airbnb great."
4099680,71498211,2016-04-25,19478466,Henri,"Anne was very attentive to detail in her communications before our stay. She was in contact with us, giving us proper directions as well as providing recommendations on local places before our arrival. The listing is accurate - it comfortably housed our group as we needed a place to stay before the Big Sur Marathon. The beach area was a short walk away, and the neighborhood was peaceful. Downtown wasn't too far of a jog or a short drive, either. The house was perfectly clean when we arrived, and the checkout instructions were clear and easy to follow. Anne was in contact with me to ensure we had everything we needed. I would definitely consider staying here again!"
4099680,72081643,2016-05-01,68007972,Urvi,We had a wonderful time during our stay. The house is great!  There are Windows everywhere to make this place feel bright and spacious. There are toys for little kids and games for adults. Everything you need is included in the home. The rooms were spacious. My only negative comment would be the curtains in the two bedrooms. It would be better if they were room darkening so during the day the rooms can be used for napping. We also so a deer family!!  I would highly recommend this home. 
4099680,73442975,2016-05-08,32093029,Caroline,"Anne was amazing.  She was very responsive and really made it easy.  We really enjoyed the Monarch Home. Homely, Cozy, Convenient and peaceful. A true gem. A home away from home."

4099680,74863119,2016-05-17,58646541,Jay,"We had a wonderful stay at Anne's home. Anne really has thought of everything. There was a binder filled with information of things to do locally,  toys to keep my kids occupied when we arrived and a kitchen filled with tea, coffee, cookies and breakfast items. I would check what is there before you do a grocery shop!

The beach was a short walk from the house as were a few restaurants. It was a great location!

Anne keep in contact before and during our stay. And was really helpful with any questions we had. 

We will definitely stay here again and recommend this home to our friends! "
4099680,76086053,2016-05-24,58889106,Craig,Anne and the home were great.  Anne is responsive and accommodating.   The home's location is ideal. Cozy place near everything.  We plan to return.

Our friends did however make the trip and were very pleased.  They said that it was a very cute and clean home.  They liked the location and the short walk down to the beach area.  We hope to get back to the area next year and will book the Monarch Home again."
4099680,76778564,2016-05-29,13463152,Rex,Anne was a fantastic host.  She was great providing information and recommendations prior to our arrival and then was exceptional about checking in with us during our stay to ensure everything was going well.  The house was super cute and very clean.  Literally a 10 minute stroll to the beach and a 5 minute drive to shopping and restaurants of PG.  Would recommend this to anyone looking to stay on the peninsula.  
4099680,77432207,2016-05-31,73954534,Sergio,The monarch house was the perfect house for a very relaxing weekend! It is in a great location and the beach is within walking distance! The house is very comfortable and clean with all the amenities of a functional house such as a washer and dryer with detergent and it easily fits comfortably 5 adults. Anne was great and very informative. She answered all our questions very promptly. 
4099680,79071567,2016-06-11,863461,Karthik,Fantastic experience staying at The Monarch home. Very clean home and all amenities that were provided were well thought out.  Anne is also is super fast at responding to questions. We'd definitely stay again when we visit Monterey next time   
4099680,79343600,2016-06-12,3693384,Ivan,"Anne's home in Pacific Grove was a wonderful place to spend a weekend with family for a local triathlon. The house goes above and beyond in its amenities and provides clearly labelled instructions throughout the house for where things are how to use them. The book selection is also superb, I'll definitely be coming back to spend another weekend here. "
4099680,80366950,2016-06-17,11592149,Helen,"I stayed in The Monarch Home for 4 nights in June 2016, with my husband, pre-schooler (almost 4), and baby (10 months). 

It really is the loveliest place! Situated on 17 Mile Drive (don't worry, you don't have to pay the toll to get here), the setting is great. We saw deer wandering past the house on more than one occasion, and although the road is a main thoroughfare, it's pretty quiet. The location is ideal for getting to Monterey, Carmel and exploring 17 Mile Drive itself and the lovely beaches. 

The home is exceptionally well appointed, and immaculate. There are also excellent appliances: a great cooker, large fridge/freezer, washer and dryer, plus a kettle - seemed to be a rare find, but much appreciated for these tea loving Brits!

All of the rooms are beautifully decorated. The beds and linens are very comfortable, and there was a baby travel cot that we made use of too. 

There are so many thoughtful touches throughout the home - Anne clearly cares a lot about her guests, including the little ones: the kiddies corner is a really kind touch!

All communications were prompt and easy, and check in/out was very straightforward. When we encountered a slight personal disaster on our trip, Anne was a total star and completely reassuring. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!"
4099680,80657378,2016-06-19,54886332,Ileana,"Anne was a wonderful host! . She was available any time we contacted her.  The house was even better than what is described. Excellent location, quite neighborhood. Perfect for two couples on vacation.  Two separate rooms and two separate bathrooms. Kitchen was perfect to cook a home cook meal and breakfast.  The beds were super comfortable!!! The house was close to the beach and walking distance to town.  Easy access by car to the 17 mile drive and Carmel. "

4099680,82286865,2016-06-27,1188506,Becky,We just stayed at The Monarch House this past weekend and absolutely enjoyed it! The house is exactly what we expected from the pictures and the location was great. It's situated in a quiet neighborhood that is a nice 20 minute walk to the shops and stores in downtown Pacific Grove. Anne was great at communicating before the visit and I felt that I could reach out to her if needed -- although everyone was so easy to access and use that we really didn't find a need to reach out. Easy access to both Carmel and Monterey. Would definitely consider staying here again!
4099680,83157086,2016-07-01,60776082,Kristine,"We greatly appreciate Anne's hospitality. The house was exactly as described in a perfect location. The house is equipped with everything you need for a 1-31 day stay, it had everything!! There are many places to explore near this home, you will never get bored. If we are ever back in Pacific Grove, we will definitely be back. "
4099680,83682963,2016-07-03,61989730,Jane,"This is a lovely home. Very well appointed and organized to make us feel right at home. Convenient to Asilomar beach, the acquarium, good restaurants and shops. "
4099680,84512069,2016-07-07,19238291,Jessica,Our family fell in love with this beautiful home. Everything was cozy and inviting and the host was the best! She had amazing communication from the day we booked until check out. The house was well stocked and organized with super comfy beds. We have young children and appreciated all the amenities she had on hand to make them feel at home. We would definitely stay here again!
4099680,85222082,2016-07-10,53519475,Feng,Anne is very hospitable and (Website hidden by Airbnb) family enjoyed our stay in this place!
4099680,86217786,2016-07-15,79910494,Cece,"Worth a return trip!  The home is very clean and very comfortable. The decoration is simple, light, and airy, and we loved waking to the natural light and fresh air which is simply unavailable in a hotel room.  Our group also included two of our adult sons, and there was plenty of room for us all.  The beds were wildly comfortable, and we slept hard and well! The living room was surprisingly large, and the kitchen had every gadget/accessory we needed.  (The photos are accurate, but we found it even more appealing in real life.)  Supermarkets in close driving distance allowed us to cook and have relaxing breakfasts and dinners, perfect bookends to fun days in Monterey and PG.  We loved the code for the door, which eliminated pesky keys, and parking was so convenient.  Anne’s communication was excellent, even while she traveled the world on her own adventure.  We wanted for nothing!  This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was a flawless one from start to finish.  Hotels may be a thing of the past for us.  Thank you, Anne, for making your home available to travelers!"
4099680,87343784,2016-07-19,53647242,Tom, Anne made us feel welcome and provided all necessary information. The listing is as advertised. 
4099680,87961935,2016-07-22,5584509,Penny,"Monarch Home is a wonderful place to stay - peaceful location, within easy reach of Monterey and on iconic 17 Mile Drive. Anne is an extremely considerate host who has thought of everything for her guests, including food, drinks, shower essentials, washing machine and dryer, night lights, comfortable beds, crisp white bed linen and even blankets for snuggling up on the sofa! The house is immaculately clean, and furnished and decorated beautifully. Anne was on hand if we needed anything. A great holiday experience - would definitely go again and highly recommend! "
4099680,88478838,2016-07-24,32937571,Scott,"Everything was very well labeled, and it had everything we could have possibly needed, including ""starter food"", WIFI. The location is not super close to downtown or the beach (about a mile), so it is most suitable if you have a car or bikes (or if you don't mind a longer walk if the weather's nice). I would especially recommend this property for a small family. The vintage kitchen is nice and bright and super cute. Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are spacious and clean (and having two bathrooms is especially nice with a family or larger group)."
4099680,89260830,2016-07-27,50130837,Oliver,"We had such a great stay in lovely Pacific Grove, close to everything! The house is charming, so cosy and absolutely spotless. Anne was on hand for everything we might need - but there was never any need to contact her because it was all perfect. Thank you for a great stay."
4099680,91762306,2016-08-06,60646095,Tina,"We really enjoyed staying at this beautiful place - everything was so well organized, loads of tips for things to do in the neighborhood.

The House is in walking distance to so many nice spots, the amazing 17 Mile Drive just starts around the corner.

Anne is a great host, always accessible & very helpful!

4099680,94689395,2016-08-16,84342241,Kerry,"The Monarch home is a lovely cottage.  We had 5 in our party & the accommodations were perfect.  The kitchen has everything you could possibly want and more.  The location was great, we were able to get to Monterey & Carmel quickly and we were so close to the quiet beach. Anne was a fabulous host & immediately replied to our texts. I would highly recommend staying here!"
4099680,96468149,2016-08-22,41830963,Mark,"Anne was in frequent communication--helpful but not intrusive--through text messages. Place was as billed, clean, lovely, and had minor kitchen essentials you need but can't buy in day long quantities. We had extra people in the house for Monterey Car Week with Anne's permission. As life would have it, the included air mattress failed. We contacted Anne and she had another delivered by early afternoon. We were impressed!  Highly recommend!"
4099680,98373901,2016-08-30,49171991,Mick,"From our first contacts for the booking to helping us book a ride for our friends, door to San Jose airport, Anne's communications added to our stay.  The location of the Monarch house is central for driving to local and nearby activities.   More importantly, the house is in a beautiful location for exploring the entire peninsula by foot (and it is worth the walk) as well as the local eateries and downtown.  Buses and shuttles were easy to catch as well.  The information in the house and Anne's guidance allowed us to maximize our enjoyment of Pacific Grove and Monterey.  The house was clean, very comfortable, and a well-stocked spice cabinet made our cooking in much easier.  The central location with an ""off the beaten path"" feel of the Monarch home made it a perfect place for us.  This is a great place to explore this area from."
4099680,99069669,2016-09-03,84704706,Cynthia,Anne made our trip very enjoyable. She was always texting to make sure everything was going fine. Her home is lovely and the neighborhood is very quiet. She provided everything and more to make things very comfortable for us. It was extremely clean. I would highly recommend this house for staying at.

4099680,101170422,2016-09-12,13500807,Vanessa,The Monarch home is lovely. It was the perfect accommodation for my family of 3 and my in-laws visiting from Florida. It was tough finding kid-friendly home for our 15-month old. There were plenty of toys to keep our son entertained and there was even a travel crib for him to sleep in. The house was fully stocked with the necessities and the beds were super comfy. Anne was a great host and made us feel right at home. We would definitely stay here again!
4099680,101715721,2016-09-14,40297442,Pippa,"The Monarch Home was great! Good location for the trail walk down to Monterey. The house itself was perfect, with hints and tips as well as essentials for our use. The beds were extra comfy!

There was quite a lot of food left and we did take advantage of it! We visited asilomar beach, road bikes along the ocean, went to Carmel by the Sea to watch the sunset, hiked in pt. Lobos. We even visited the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a wonderful and memorable trip! Your home was described exactly as you described. If we are ever visiting this beautiful area again, we would love to stay here again! 
Sincerely, Beverly"
4099680,103701656,2016-09-23,28143182,Glenys,We were two couples and we found the house very comfortable with plenty of space for us all.  Separate bathrooms was great.  Anne provided all she states and more.  We wanted for nothing.  should we be back this way we would certainly stay here if possible.  Pacific Grove is a lovely area away from the bustle but close enough to get it if you wanted.  Thanks Anne.
4099680,104463744,2016-09-26,10110634,Weibo,"Anne is super friendly, flexible and helpful. We had to check out a bit late and she has no problem accommodating us. The house is clean, cozy and has everything you will need! We took advantage of the cereal and cream and had two great breakfast. All the sheets and towers are clean as new. The house is in the center of pacific grove. It's 5 mins from all the restaurants and golf links. Will definitely stay with Anne again next time in town. Thank you!"

Thanks for a great stay!"
4099680,106346389,2016-10-05,71410324,Li,The house is gorgeous! My wife and I had a wonderful time there. There is hiking trail nearby and beach within walking distance. Trader joe is about 5 mins drive so you can cook a great meal and enjoy the time with your family.
4099680,106964777,2016-10-09,41482380,Bill,"We were visiting Monterey with friends for two nights to look for birds along the coast.

Anne was very responsive during the booking and our stay. And she has set up her house to make your stay feel like home. 

Thanks Anne!"

Even though we didn't have a chance to meet face-to-face, the entire experience was smooth, pleasant, and probably one of the best experiences I've had on AirBnB. We felt like locals for the weekend, was able to use the aquarium passes, and relaxed in Anne's cute and well-appointed cottage. The sheets were very soft, great water pressure in the shower, and we appreciated the detailed and clear instructions Anne had left for us. If we visit Monterey again, we'll definitely consider staying at Anne's again. Thank you for a great experience!"
4099680,111966390,2016-11-03,15034807,Long,Very lucky to have Anne's house to stay during our road trip on hwy 1. The place is very clean and we have everything needed to live for a group of 5 adults. The location is also great and it is just near the gorgeous town Monterey and entry to 17 miles road. I will recommend this place to every family and group.
4099680,113921010,2016-11-14,382902,Yale,"Thank you for a wonderful stay in Pacific Grove! We had a fantastic time participating in the race at Monterey Bay/PG -- and your location was PERFECT (far enough away from the hubbub of downtown MB, but close enough that all the touristy amenities were available when we sought them out). Thank you for being easy to get in touch with, and for all the local tips. Highly recommended!!"

4099680,123317118,2016-12-28,83406102,JoAnn,"Nice week in PG
with family; required one-level and two bathrooms for my Mother. Difficult to find these features in the Grove and would recommend for other small families with similar needs."

The beds were great and it felt like a home away from home.  That is all we can ask for when we spend so much time traveling for work.  Thank you for sharing and making it a place we could feel like we were home.  I will definitely look for this place when in the area again."
4099680,128154505,2017-01-22,76980653,Sophia,"What a lovely weekend stay at Anne's Monarch home! Our family of four felt perfectly at home from the moment we walked in. The house was clean, comfortable, and cozy. And the furniture was right in line with what we love, rustic, modern, and simple. 

Traveling with two little toddlers is always a challenge, to keep the kids happy and excited to explore. It was a rainy weekend, so we stayed in a lot. But we didn't mind, the home offered so much for the kids entertainment, with lots of books and simple toys, but clutter free and organized. 

It was so cool to stay in the ""house that comes with instructions""! And communication with Anne was excellent, she was so helpful throughout our stay. 

When we had to leave to go our ""real home"" our four year old daughter cried, she enjoyed our ""new home"" so much. Thank you Anne, we hope to stay here again! "

4099680,133132284,2017-02-20,21529712,Julie,"We booked our stay in memory of Mom who was a huge fan of Pacific Grove. The Monarch Home is a short walk to one of the nature areas where my parents liked to walk to enjoy the Monarch migration. The beautiful coast, dining, & popular Monterey attractions are a short drive away. The floor plan of the house works great for 2 couples or a family. The house was clean & cozy. We enjoyed fires in the fireplace each evening. There is a nice dining space in the yard for when the weather is good. Our host, Anne, is very attentive to detail & was very responsive to making our stay a pleasure."
4099680,133766424,2017-02-24,16687992,Joyce,Great place for anyone with small children and those who like to take long walks. You'll need a car to get to restaurants and shopping but a quiet little getaway for weekends!!
4099680,134721193,2017-02-28,14592053,John,"The Monarch House is a super comfortable, well-appointed home in Pacific Grove. It was 10 minutes from the best golf courses in the country, as well as the grocery stores, pizza places, and fine dining. It has everything, and everything is labeled, making this the most user-friendly place I've ever stayed. Anne is hyper-responsive via text or the app, and both check in and check out was a breeze. We even had room to park cars! Next time I'm on the peninsula, I want to stay with Anne and the Monarch House. "

The house is very clean and comfortable with more amenities than what is needed. We traveled with our two young kids without problem. She even has toys and books in the house that our kids loved for the ""rest"" times. Neighbors are very friendly and location is awesome. Less than a mile to the beaches and tide pools. Very close to Cannery Row and the aquarium. We also enjoyed Downtown Pacific Grove. Next time we travel to NoCal we will surely hope to stay here again! "
4099680,141582768,2017-04-03,24330232,San,The quaint home has everything that a vacationing family would need. Anne had paid attention to all the details in making sure our stay was as smooth as it could be. We would definitely use her place again when we visit Pacific Groves.

4099680,152675796,2017-05-17,126184052,Ann-Marie,"The Monarch Home is a great place to stay if you are looking for a home away from home this is your place. It has all the amenities you would need for cooking, sleeping and even just hanging out and relaxing. It is in a great location close to the beautiful coastline, downtown Pacific Grove, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and Cannery Row. The house is well lit and has a lot of natural light. It is clean, organized and comfortable. The only flaw we found was that it resides on the very busy scenic 17 mile drive which has quite a bit of daytime traffic. It didn't really bother us that much but we were only cued in because we had our two little who napped during the day. It was pretty quiet at night which was good. The communication with Anne was excellent, she was welcoming,  friendly and helpful always responding to any questions promptly. This was our first experience booking with an Airbnb so we were extremely nervous. We couldn't have been happier with how nice it was and the entire experience. The Monarch Home has set the bar high for all of our future stays in other locations. We will definitely stay here again when in this area. "
4099680,153703589,2017-05-21,11131053,Hannah,"My family and I recently stayed in Anne's home in Pacific Grove and had a wonderful time.  The house is in a great location - just a couple minutes drive to the main street in Pacific Grove where there are plenty of cute restaurants as well as shops to browse through.  The house was very clean and well-appointed.  It had everything we needed and more.  Anne clearly takes very good care of the home and made sure to have all the little extras to make our stay as convenient and easy as possible.  While the house isn't very big, it was perfect for the four of us.  The beds are very comfortable and even the air mattress is a nice one - plenty big and really deep so that you're not just sleeping right off the ground.  

Anne really has this Airbnb thing down - there are labels and instructions all over the house so you're never trying to figure out where the glasses are or how to work the thermostat or turn on the TV.  It really seemed like she had thought of everything.  Anne was very clear in her communication (how to find the house, how to get in, etc.) and was super responsive.  And while she checked in with us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed, she left us to enjoy our stay in peace.

All in all, we had a really great time and would definitely stay here again!"
4099680,154292613,2017-05-23,9788,Malayka,This was an excellent place to stay. The beds were exceptionally comfortable. The house was tidy and well stocked with all amenities. It was a great location - a five minute drive to the fabulous Monterey Aquarium and a five minute drive to the beautiful Asilomar Beach. The host was friendly and gave us numerous helpful suggestions. She has a binder full of maps and information about the area. The layout of the home is perfect for two couples or a family. We hope to be back. Highly recommended.
4099680,154696447,2017-05-25,54895443,Mariana,"La casa es increíble,en un barrio muy tranquilo, la casa es muy cómoda y la cocina de los años '50  es hermosa!!!"
4099680,155696721,2017-05-28,2325709,Rachel,We couldn't have asked for a better spot (or host!) for our stay in the Monterey/Big Sur area. We were two couples staying at the Monarch Home and Anne's place was absolutely perfect. We had ample space to stay and we were able to take advantage of her well-equipped kitchen to prepare some lovely breakfasts and lunches. The location was excellent as we spent most evenings in the Carmel or Big Sur area for wedding festivities. Anne was impeccable with her suggestions and directions and we never had any doubt that we were in great hands. Anne we can only hope that we'll get a chance to come back to stay with you again!! Thank you for opening up your lovely space to us.
4099680,157869059,2017-06-04,55047232,Sarah,"Amazing house and amazing host.  I highly recommend this location for your trip.  Mine was a girls weekend, but it's great for families too!"
4099680,158451900,2017-06-06,4680115,Judith,"Anne's place is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood.  It is close to everything and just minutes drive to the beach, grocery stores and restaurants.  Annie communicated with us before, during and after our stay at her place.  She responded right away if we have questions.  Her place has everything you need plus much more including fresh milk in the ref  at our arrival. It was a pleasure staying at her place.   It is truly a home away from home."
4099680,159081113,2017-06-09,127782294,James,"Truly wonderful experience to stay in this house. Quiet location but very atmospheric. The host has thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable. The area is beautiful, on the edge of 17 mile drive and walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove. We loved staying here. A truly unique, beautiful experience. Faultless! "
4099680,159814569,2017-06-11,46248726,Lori,"I lost count of how often we said ""Anne thinks of everything""! Before the trip the communication was A+, and although we never met she gave so much useful info: responsive text msgs, notes all over the lovely house, binders with listings for restaurants, groceries, attractions: <10mins from the Aquarium, 5 mins from Lovers Point Beach, 15 min from Carmel Mission. After sightseeing, my family (husband, grandmas and toddler) chose to stay in, cook dinner, and bond.  And we slept comfortably each night: road noise of 17 mile drive was not bad at all. The adorable, well-stocked, kid-friendly house was our Best Air Bnb experience yet,  and we totally want to re-visit with friends soon."
4099680,160360145,2017-06-13,132781871,Sean,Was a great stay and a great place.  As advertised 2 good sized bedrooms and 2 good sized bathrooms.  Nice location little bit of a walk to the coast line but worth it!
4099680,160818990,2017-06-15,105405096,Janet,"Anne is very prompt in terms of communication and her house is decorated and kept extremely well. We enjoyed spending our mornings in the sun filled kitchen/dining area using provisions from the very well stocked pantry.  People who choose to bake will be happy to find all the equipment you'll need, which was something we'd never encountered in the past Airbnbs we've stayed in. 
While being very close to the city center of Monterey, the house is located in a quiet residential area where deer roam. You can walk, bike and drive around the area and find things to do! 
Anne meticulously labeled everything in the house and where and how to find things that it was really easy to find all that we needed to feel right at home.  

Thanks again for having us!"
4099680,161299820,2017-06-17,117359055,Kristi,"This place was amazing!  What great communication by the host, such amazing suggestions and directions.  We love Pacific Grove, so this was a perfect location to enjoy Monterey, Carmel, and Pacific Grove!"
4099680,162191221,2017-06-19,6176589,Atefeh,"This place is beautiful. The house is clean, big and has everything that we needed. It is perfectly located, really close to beaches and to monterey. Anne is really a great host. We will come back!"
4099680,163136396,2017-06-23,128984102,Jana,"Anne's house is a great place to stay!  It is very clean, and it is located close to many fun things to do.  She gives good information about recommendations for restaurants and activities.  The communication was excellent, and we knew what to expect every step of the process.  We would definitely stay here again."
4099680,163843330,2017-06-25,8112022,Jessica,Comfortable house for two couples.  Very clean and well equipped.  Great host with precise instructions and good communication.  Pacific Groves still retains its rustic charm and not so developed and hectic as Monterey and Carmel.
4099680,164816927,2017-06-29,65976734,Kaushik,"Going into our 3 night stay at the Monarch Home, my family and I had high expecations based on the glowing reviews. I'm happy to report that the reviews were spot on, and the stay exceeded our expectations.

Communication and check-in/check-out process: timely, accurate, and easy to understand. Anne was a delight to communicate with, and patiently answered all of our questions.

Amenities in the home: Just amazing. My 3 daughters aged 11, 8, and 6 loved the toy and book collection. My wife absolutely loved the kitchen and the fact that it was incredibly well stocked. I just loved the amount of natural light in the home and the proximity to all attractions in the area. The extra airbed was a genius idea and came in handy with the kids.

Noise and neighborhood: Quiet, pristine, and safe. Yes, we were right on 17 mile drive and there were some passing traffic but this was to be expected. We left the windows open at night and the noise was not bothersome to us. The neighborhood is very quiet and we felt incredibly safe.

Overall we loved every minute of our stay, and my family is already missing the Monarch home. We will definitely be going back sooner rather than later.

Thank you Anne, for sharing your beautiful home with us.

4099680,166202135,2017-07-02,61211094,Jennifer,Anne was easy to communicate with and her home was just charming.  She thought of everything when it came to wants and needs and we felt like we were at home.  The monarch home and our stay in pacific grove was just what we needed after the hustle and activity in LA
4099680,168004545,2017-07-08,121073655,Kris,"As described, good value.  Anne is an attentive host.  Quiet neighbors; close to Asilomar beach.  Everything went smoothly."
4099680,171410970,2017-07-17,6932947,Mary,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anne's ""Monarch Home"". The place was cozy and very clean. There were labels and instructions all around the home, so it was easy to figure everything out. Anne checked up on us to make sure things were going well. We rented bikes, went kayaking and had some gorgeous walks on the beach. I also enjoyed using the beach chair to read at nearby Asilomar beach. "
4099680,172398470,2017-07-20,1348762,Joshua,"Anne's place in Pacific Grove is fantastic, a real Airbnb gem.  The two bedroom, two bathroom layout gives a lot of flexibility.  It's also a great place for a child--Anne had toys all ready and the inside is very safe.  The location is ideal--the beach is only a 10-15 minute walk--and parking was no problem.  I can see why this place gets such well deserved high ratings--the communication is excellent and the place is quite charming, not to mention that hotels in this area are exorbitant.  We definitely hope to come back here."
4099680,173707196,2017-07-23,14059539,Lety,"My family had a great time at the Monarch home. I loved all the details of it. It was cozy and very clean, kitchen was fully stocked with essentials. The space is perfect for a small family. Ann was a great host. She replied to my messages right away and made sure I was taken care of. It was extremely helpful that she  labeled everything around the house. It's a very quiet neighborhood and we actually got to see a young deer in the back alley. My son was very excited to see it up close! It is conveniently located a few minutes away from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and downtown shopping area. I would highly recommend staying in the beautiful Monarch home."
4099680,176371490,2017-07-30,94227773,Jason,"An excellent Airbnb which has everything and is very well situated near both the beach and downtown!! The house is beautiful, spacious, relaxing and we enjoyed our stay very much. Anne kept us informed throughout and made everything so easy. Pacific Grove has a real community feel. The deer are friendly too. 
Highly recommended and we hope to return one day. Thank you for sharing your home with us.

4099680,177671278,2017-08-03,95227544,Annalinda,We loved the house and Anne really thought of everything. Best equipped holiday home we've stayed in and very clean. The location is great and the  instructions and information were excellent.

It is conveniently located to wonderful restaurants, The Monterey Bay Aquarium and serene beaches. Anne remained available and was very attentive. My family and I hope to return to The Monarch home soon. Thank you, Anne."
4099680,181858274,2017-08-13,115393369,Andrew,"This is a great house if you have kids. Lots of room, games available, and both bathrooms were nice. Very close to the aquarium but also a good jumping off point for other activities in the area."
4099680,183181899,2017-08-16,77693420,Erin,We had a great couple days at The Monarch home. Us and our three kids really enjoyed our time at the home and the access it provided to Monterey and Pacific Grove.

The house is in a quiet, safe location yet within walking distance to coastal views and the Pacific Grove main strip. We really enjoyed every minute of our stay. And Anne was a great host! She was prompt to answering text messages and preparing us prior to the trip. Highly recommend!"
4099680,188552678,2017-08-29,71010143,Lori,"We enjoyed our stay at the Monarch House.   Anne has gone to a lot of trouble to make her home cozy and inviting.   She also provided a lot of information about touring the area, restaurants, etc.   Everything is very clear and communication is great.   The house is exactly as depicted."
4099680,189453488,2017-09-01,44876659,Alla,"House is nicely located, close to Monterey and Carmel. Host was very nice, lots of details on features of the house and area.
We loved our stay."
4099680,190720601,2017-09-04,100407530,Farra,Anne was a great host. She was very communicative and accommodating. She even went above and beyond to help us find a babysitter during our stay!
4099680,191257045,2017-09-06,8056517,Daniel,Anne's place was exactly as described and was the perfect for our family getaway. She was very helpful in making sure we were thoroughly accommodated. She went the extra mile in making sure you were comfortable and gave many tips to enjoy your stay. Highly recommended!
4099680,192990646,2017-09-11,91400361,Sheko,"The location of Anne's place is excellent, so close to everything.  It is very comfortable and spacious.  The bedding was so soft and warm and the great room was perfect for evening entertainment.  The kitchen is well equipped and we enjoyed cooking and eating on the table in front of the big window.  Thanks for a lovely stay."

Anne is perfect ans with a good communication.
Great journey."
4099680,194767097,2017-09-17,5655176,Nicole,Great location for our family to visit for a wedding in Monterey. Easy 10-15 minute drive to downtown. Host was very nice and communicated clearly early and throughout the stay to ensure we were comfortable. Nice kids area with some toys for my 5 month old. Would stay here again if visiting the area. 
4099680,196041875,2017-09-21,2020012,Donal,"My wife and I spent several nights at Anne's place with our two young boys. It was an ideal place for us to explore the Pacific Grove and Monterey area with our family, close to everything but in a nice quiet location. We walked to the restaurants in PG and to the beach. The aquarium and Cannery Row was just a few minutes away by car.

The home is quiet, clean and safe, with everything we needed for our stay. The access code entry system is very convenient. The children's toys are a nice touch and the highlight for our 3 year old!"
4099680,197769209,2017-09-26,20043093,Marissa,"The place was great, the rooms and bathroom situation was great for splitting with another family because it was evenly divided. Kid friendly environment (toys and tv plus there weren't a bunch of knick knacks everywhere for us to worry about). Loved that there was a driveway for parking. The whole place was modern and up to date including the bathroom being stocked with everything we needed. The windows were awesome and easy to open and close for air, the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, and Anne was available (responded right away at any time) and gracious. We are definitely planning to come back for another visit. I wish I would have known that the gate in the pictures around the house weren't totally enclosed. I was thinking I could let the kids run around outside but that wasn't the case. It doesn't change my opinion of the place, just good to know. Even though the listing says it can be loud, we did not experience that at all, it was very peaceful. I loved that there was a door separating the rooms from the kitchen and living because of sleeping children. Honestly, it felt like my own home!!!"
4099680,198504369,2017-09-29,44227607,Phyllis,"The Monarch Home was beautiful, cozy, clean and conveniently located. The bed was so comfortable that we are going to buy the comforter at our home!

Anne is very responsive and thoughtful in making sure that we had a comfortable stay. Will definitely stay here again if we come back to Monterrey (I hope soon)"
4099680,199344918,2017-10-01,46248726,Lori,"Our second time in four months to visit The Monarch House. As clean, cute and conveniently located as we remember. Anne's leaves a plethora of information both in print form--all over the house, a binder of local info, etc.-- and via the Aibnb app (download that, people. It's great). Less that 10 minutes from MB Aquarium and Lovers Point, 5 minutes from Asilomar. Could probably hike to the latter.  Kid loved it, too. Recommended."
4099680,200243163,2017-10-04,61864124,Rachel,"非常不错的房子,两个小孩玩的不亦说乎,提供很多玩具,附近环境优美,安静,床品很舒服,有两个洗手间,对于我们两家人入住是非常方便的,前后院子都很美"
4099680,201718965,2017-10-08,134583477,Lori,"Anne has thought of everything in this home.  Expectations of travelers are simple and reasonable.  This is a gem of a home, nestled on 17 mile drive, offering great walks and nearby ammenities of every kind.  Anne has done everything to make you feel like a welcome friend instead of an intruder, offering thoughtful touches like plenty of supplies of all kinds.  The result is you feel like your staying in her home instead of renting her home"

The host Anne was on top of everything and there were great touches throughout the house and generous amenities. It really made for a great weekend in the area and we all agreed we would rent again!"
4099680,207746001,2017-10-29,64994864,Bunny,Perfect place to stay for friends or couples traveling together. There are 2 full baths which is a great feature.

4099680,208948274,2017-11-03,95046364,Renee,"Anne's Monarch House is  a lovely (most comfortable) home - there was plenty of space for two couples.(2 queen beds/2 separate bathrooms and a complete kitchen with a table for 4!)  We loved that it was so close to ""downtown"" Pacific Grove (such a quaint town) and to (our fav) Trader Joe's.  It was the perfect location for all of our day trips...down Highway 1 to Big Sur, 17 Mile Dr and Pebble Beach, wine tasting in Carmel and Carmel Valley, and a walk through Cannery Row.  We were pleasantly surprised by all the food ""basics"" in the fridge and cupboards - great compliment to our snacking.  Anne was quick to communicate and stayed in touch with us.  Yes, the house sits right on 17 Mile Dr - a busy street (especially during rush hour), but traffic noise was NOT an issue.  It wasn't until our last day....when we visited the Monarch Sanctuary....that it dawned on me why she named the house ""Monarch House.""  ;  )  Great house / Great value."

Anne's communication was timely and welcoming. She made sure we got all information we needed at the right time."

4099680,213725058,2017-11-22,92190098,Tracy,"The house was lovely and welcoming. It felt just like home staying there. The host had put together a information binder(includes recommended restaurants and tourist sites and their detailed information), which is extremely convinent for visitors. It is defiantly going to be our first choice if we are coming back."
4099680,214395261,2017-11-25,1448868,Thomas,"Anne was an excellent and attentive host and the house is outstanding.  There are two very comfortable bedrooms and two bathrooms across the hall, one for each.  A really nice touch was a variety of breakfast makings - something that used to be common in Airbnb but one doesn't see much any longer.  The house is on 17 Mile Drive in the heart of Pacific Grove, a short walk to the ocean - perfect location.  Highly recommended."
4099680,217525456,2017-12-09,174989,Jen,Lovely home very close to everything.  I LOVE asilomar and it's minutes away as is the cute little village of Pacific Grove.  I was there alone but good layout if you are two couples.  Anne is well-organized and helpful and there are cute notes and instructions throughout.  Often when I had a question I just looked around for a sweet note:). Thanks Anne!

We loved taking walks to the nearby George Washington Park with our two year old boys.  The playground at the Calendonia Park was also a fun outing for our boys.  Anne was very responsive and her home was well stocked with the everyday essentials for cooking, bathing, sleeping, lounging, as well as plenty of recommendations for things to do and see in the area.  We look forward to staying here again soon!"
4099680,221207024,2017-12-25,5409277,Jacey,"This cozy, quiet little house was the ideal spot to stay with our young family for our first Christmas together. It was clean and well-organized with a great selection of books for us and toys for the tot. It felt like a true home away from home."
4099680,222090160,2017-12-28,20118906,Kate,"Anne’s place was in a great location in Pacific Grove. My parents and I walked everywhere - the Butterfly Sanctuary, Aquarium, dinner, etc. Even though it’s on a main street, I found it quiet at night so slept very soundly. It also helped that the beds were super comfortable! Perfect space for the three of us and would return!"
4099680,224318358,2018-01-02,141863846,Jennie,"The Monarch Home is a delight. Anne has made certain your stay is without a care; her careful touches are backed up by wee little ""reminder"" notes to help your stay go smoothly. A fire already placed on the hearth warmed the chilly nights over the New Year Holiday. Extra down comforters kept us cozy and the kitchen was well appointed...little extras were everywhere! It was an easy walk to the beach and right between Monterey and Carmel!"
4099680,225222252,2018-01-05,6619380,Noelle,Beautiful house in a very nice location. There is everything you need inside to feel like home. Can't wait to come back!
4099680,226273956,2018-01-09,82484077,Marjorie,"We stayed here with our 13 mo old daughter and in-laws for a few days while my husband and I attended a conference at Asilomar. It was the perfect place for the grandparents to have a home base while exploring pacific grove with the little one. Anne is a wonderful and attentive host, and the home has everything you would need to be comfortable and happy, even toys and books for the little ones! I highly recommend!"
4099680,227705533,2018-01-15,26319886,John,The house was very family friendly and included toys for our toddler. There was also a pack n play. The home was great. Very clean. Had some food for when we arrived. Beds were very comfortable. Definitely would recommend and would stay here again.
4099680,229074139,2018-01-21,28530284,Jenna,"Wow! Where to begin?! The Monarch Home is the perfect place to stay in Pacific Grove. The location is so convenient—just minutes from the Monarch Sanctuary, restaurants and shops in downtown Pacific Grove, and the water. We absolutely loved how thoughtful of a host Anne is. Everything in the house is labeled with helpful instructions so it's easy to turn on the heater, work the lights, find extra bedding, etc. It was also a fantastic place to stay with our infant. In addition to having a pack n' play for him to sleep in, there were a number of books and toys to keep him occupied in the living room. Anne does an amazing job of making sure the house is outfitted with everything you could possibly need to make your stay enjoyable, including a fully stocked kitchen, toiletries, books and magazines, beach supplies and more. The house is also beautifully decorated. It truly felt like the perfect home away from home. Anne was quick to respond to questions and had excellent communication with us from the moment we booked our stay to the moment we checked out. What a gem! Highly recommend!!"

4099680,232668602,2018-02-05,169624886,Michael,"We enjoyed our stay here.  The hostess Anne was very attentive to our needs making sure we were enjoying ourselves.  The location of the house was great; close to the beach and downtowns of Pacific Grove and Monterey.  Just as a notice, this house is located on a slightly busy street.  However, traffic noise did die down around 9 or 10pm.  Anne did make us aware of this after we booked the stay.  Overall, it was a very clean and comfortable home, and a pleasant experience."

Very comfortable and clean house in a great location. Close to the beach, tide pools and Cannery Row. We loved our time once again. Thanks Anne!"

It's location allowed easy exploring of Carmel, Asilomar State Beach, Pacific Grove, Monterey, the Aquarium, and bike rides on 17 mile Drive.  The home had plenty of space for the four of us and was extremely accommodating for our 2.5 year old and our 8 month old with toys, a crib, and games.  The home had every amenity we could need along with a well stocked kitchen and Anne was very attentive.  We can't wait to go back!"
4162387,22855599,2014-11-16,4440997,Prabhat,Joy's place was perfect for a one night stay as we came down to run the Big Sur Half Marathon. Its definitely big enough to fit 4 but be aware the only bathroom is through the bedroom. Otherwise it was clean well done up  and had some cool touches. Pacific Grove is also a wonderful neighborhood and this sweet and simple place was just what we needed. Thanks Joy!
4162387,23228067,2014-11-25,9006134,Judy,"We loved this little old cottage.  It has the most beautiful stained glass and is perfect for a couple looking for a chance to experience a stay in a cosy 100 year old house, a piece of American history. If you want all modern conveniences and a 21st century experience book into a motel down the road.  The  historic neighborhood with all it's jumble of old summer cottages is totally unique.  Easy walking access to shops and restaurants, coast and the famous butterfly sanctuary.   Easy driving access to miles of fantastic coast line and many interesting coastal towns including Monterey.  We enjoyed meeting Joy and seeing her houses which she where she is preserving   their antique charm wherever possible. Joy  was responsive and available to answer questions and offer local advice. "
4162387,23311316,2014-11-28,7225322,Julie,"This is a very cute little house with some neat period details. Our host was friendly and easily accessible. She was very accommodating of our travel schedule and offered us both early check-in and late check-out. The location is fantastic - easy access to shops and restaurants, and just a few blocks from the ocean. The heater was having some issues (that the host told us about and was addressing), but we ended up not needing it after all. One note is that the shower is very small; we did fine but larger sized adults may find it a little challenging. Also, there is not a microwave; we ended up using the stove and oven to reheat some leftovers - this worked fine, but guests should know there is not a microwave available. "
4162387,23340142,2014-11-29,2258475,Neil,"Great location just a few steps from nice shops and coffee places in Pacific Grove, which is a great town. Joy was very easy to reach and communicate with and very friendly. The house is on the smaller and older side, but that's part of the charm assuming you're not looking for something very new."
4162387,24394632,2014-12-27,25086573,Thien,"Beautiful and cozy cottage, with a cool house hint book. Near main street of nice coastal neighborhood. Joy is very responsive and welcoming."
4162387,24903285,2015-01-03,427800,Ben,"A wonderful, delightful, peace-laden & inspiring trip, made by staying at the Little Blue House, & encountering Joy. Never was a woman more fittingly named. Am loathe to write the review I'd like to for fear I'll never be able to book in again. Perfect stay. "
4162387,25001320,2015-01-04,25550827,Shannon,"The cottage was very cozy.  It is a historic cottage which was cool.  The Stainglass windows were very beautiful, as well as the art.  Walking distance to rent bicycles and about a mile and a half from Cannery Row and the aquarium great location.thank you for letting us stay in your cozy cabin!!"
4162387,25291339,2015-01-11,25517938,Amy,"Our stay in the Little Blue House was perfect for our getaway weekend. It was cozy, well appointed and close to town. We enjoyed our stay. Host was friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Highly recommended for folks who appreciate originality and exploring the Pacific Grove area. We will definitely come back and stay again. "
4162387,26035481,2015-02-01,8479205,Liz,"The little blue house was perfect!

We were a group of three and enjoyed cooking in the small kitchen / living space. We were very comfortable and Joy was super flexible and kind! SHe even gave us a tour of her other house (larger) next door - which was amazing! 

The stained glass really is pretty stellar, too & you can't beat the location. We walked to some of the shops and restaurants & I recommend the coffee shop just about a block down. Yum!"
4162387,26086157,2015-02-02,7358818,Siobhán,"We had such an amazing stay at Joy's house!! It is really close to the beach, as she said herself leave the house, turn left and walk until your feet get wet! She was really responsive before our stay and check in was incredibly easy. We will definitely be back! Thank you Joy!!"
4162387,26183914,2015-02-06,8762888,Aubrie,"Joy was incredibly accommodating and super sweet. Unfortunately we were not able to meet her in person, but she pointed us out to amazing cafes and made us feel super welcomed. The Little Blue House was perfectly located for us, was the perfect size, and the surrounding neighborhood and shops were all so sweet. Overall, a perfect stay for a quick in and out. "
4162387,26264602,2015-02-08,26140560,Ryan,"Joy was just as great as I had heard through her previous reviews. The house was really cozy and awesome, and the Art House next door was also great. All the Art that was created in these two houses made it even more worth the trip down to Pacific Grove. The neighborhood was safe, clean, and really fun place to hang out at. The location was amazing, only a few blocks from lovers point, and the aquarium, and also very close to good food and shops. As I said before the accommodations were above and beyond what myself and the other guests could've ever imagined. I can't stress enough that this stay at Joy's place was really an unforgettable time. "
4162387,26382915,2015-02-10,10239516,Sunny,"The Little Blue House was a sweet little place indeed. The surrounding neighborhood was charming and friendly. Joy was a helpful and timely hostess, even giving us great suggestions for meals via text.
We stayed with our toddler and felt a little cramped in the bed, but luckily the couch turns into a pretty comfy queen and we were able to sleep with ease. 
Thank you Joy!"
4162387,26496730,2015-02-14,20578799,Lia,"Joy was always so easy to talk to in correspondence leading up to our trip.  She was very responsive as well.  I could tell she was very friendly and welcoming.  When we arrived she happened to be walking up to leave lights on for us- we arrived a little earlier than expected.  So it was nice to meet in person.  Again she was very friendly and hospitable.  Left us alone pretty quickly but made sure we knew she was available if we needed anything.  She doesn't live too far from the little blue house.  The house is adorable and was just perfect for us!  I love all the charm!  The neighborhood is awesome too!  Short walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove- tons of restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, etc.  Joy also gives great recommendations in her guest book in the house.  We also walked down to the water from the house easily- seemed like it took less than 10 minutes to walk to Lovers Point.  It was great to grab coffee and walk down there in the morning.  We highly recommend this cute home in this charming neighborhood and working with Joy is a pleasure!  Great experience! "
4162387,26811284,2015-02-19,5184125,Camille,"We had a great time at Joy's little blue house. The place is very nice, neat, warm as your own place. The neighbourhood is very nice and quiet, but also lively if you walk five minutes down the road. Also Joy left us insider notes on the house and activities around. Thank you Joy !"
4162387,27193207,2015-02-27,3294571,Alvaro,"The little blue house was a really nice spot to make a pause on our way to San Francisco, the house is clean and cozy. Host was really accommodating with our variable arrival time because there was some road closures. "
4162387,27568009,2015-03-07,5820592,Hector,"The Little Blue House was a great, last-minute find. Super convenient to the best parts of Pacific Grove/Monterey, and the check in/check out process (from Instant Book all the way through arrival and departure) was smooth and efficient.

Lots of great tips in the house guide book (Pavel's Bakery is a world class gem) and the energy of this quaint house makes me very happy we were able to stay in Joy's little gem. "
4162387,27892578,2015-03-14,12030507,Brian,"Wonderful. Joy, the host, was great.  Her art, which is everywhere in the house, provides welcome character.   The neighborhood is a quiet part of PG. We stayed with our 5 year old.  It was nice to walk to parks and lots of shopping and eating options.  We couldn't have been happier."
4162387,28133335,2015-03-18,28059269,Natasha,"Joy gave us the info on finding the key right away when we booked our stay. When we arrived everything was as described, and the cottage was as nice as in the pictures--even bigger than expected. She had a fresh cut rose and a notebook with hints for the cottage, checking out and tips for things to see in the neighborhood. She also let us know where to get groceries and coffee, essential when traveling! We had a quick question on how to adjust the temp when we arrived and she responded very quickly by text. The cottage was clean and welcoming and in a prime location!!

It is just a few blocks from the beach, coffee shops, groceries, restaurants and cute boutiques. Such a charming, artsy, bohemian area to wander through. And we always found parking near the cottage for the few times we used the car. The neighborhood was safe, friendly and quiet at night. We slept very soundly in our cozy bed and awoke to seagulls in the morning calling from the shore. The perfect beachside experience here, highly recommend!!!
"
4162387,28347056,2015-03-22,14650087,Carri,"Joy was super helpful and very responsive.  The home was just as described in the photo and joy was very accommodating.  We came here w two little children, and they did great.  Downtown pacific grove was just a could blocks away as was the beach."

4162387,28669804,2015-03-28,2020626,Deb,"This cottage is simple and cozy as described. The location is great with restaurants, coffee and the coast in easy walking distance. We enjoyed breakfast at Holly's and dinner at the Red House Cafe. The bed was comfortable and the wifi worked so my family members were happy. If you're a coffee snob, Crema serves Verve and the Happy Girl in Monterey serves Blue Bottle. Overall, we were pleased with this cottage and our mini-vacation to Monterey Bay.

We would stay here again!"
4162387,29011478,2015-04-02,29592794,Annette," We stayed two days in The Little Blue House in  picturesque neighborhood. It's a lovely cottage with a comfortable bed and also good sofa bed. We found all we need, plaids, comfortable towels, kitchen with nice dishes and glasses, books and board games and enjoyed the time there really. "
4162387,29072950,2015-04-03,18230901,Eugene,A really cozy historical cottage in the center of Pacific Grove. A bock from the shops on the main street and maybe three blocks from the ocean at Lover's Point. Really a unique chance to stay in a Victorian California Bungalow. The owner was also quite nice and personally leave restaurant and sightseeing recommendations for the area. We would go back in an instant.  
4162387,29569804,2015-04-09,29590504,Beni,"Our stay at the Little Blue House went great! The location is excellent, the house is cozy and has all you may end up needing. Owner was very quick to respond. Would definitely stay there again. "
4162387,29692038,2015-04-11,520751,Jaspal,"What a fun stay we had at The Little Blue House! It was the perfect getaway for me and my family. A cozy home away from home with an interesting history. Since it was walking distance to the beach and to good eats in Pacific Grove, we barely left the neighborhood during our stay. This is where we hope to stay the next time we are back in Monterey/PG. Joy was a wonderful host, responsive ahead of and during our visit."
4162387,29755730,2015-04-12,17979395,Alex & Kelly,Perfect location and a wonderful host. We will definitely come back again to the little blue house. Thanks for a memorable experience and all the local tips!!

We had no issues with the stay, the house is a perfect size for us and we loved how Joy decorated the place.  The house was very clean and I felt extremely safe in the area the house was in.  It was a short walk to the beach and surrounding shops.  We loved that we didn't have to use the car.  Joy even surprised us with fresh baked cookies and they were the greatest chocolate chip cookies I've ever ate!  Thank you Joy for a lovely home and we had a great stay!"
4162387,30152787,2015-04-18,28420029,Lindsey,"Joy made us feel more than welcome on our trip. The house was so beautiful and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The beach was just a couple blocks away which made for a nice, quick walk."
4162387,30224566,2015-04-19,28577688,Anna,"Our stay at the Little Blue House was really pleasant. The Pacific Grove area is a really picturesque beach town. About 15 minutes away is Carmel, which has a great selection of shopping and eating. I highly recommend La Bicyclette for a great wood fire pizza and wine selection. 

The house itself was just as listed and Joy provided us with lots of towels and linens (it was a little cold at night, but we had plenty of blankets to keep warm)."

4162387,31681987,2015-05-08,13280812,Stephen,"A beautiful little house in a great location. Joy's little notes helped us out with the house and with where to go in the area. Her recommendation of Pufferfish for dinner was amazing.

We really enjoyed our stay and I will recommend the little blue house and Joys other AirBnB next door as well."
4162387,31770769,2015-05-10,27406431,Kimberly,The host sent us an email telling us that the house was available early.  We had difficulty getting into the lockbox and the owner responded immediately.  
4162387,32064218,2015-05-13,22266317,Yomara,The house is small but cozy. It is ideal for two to three people. The location is great as well. Walking distance to several places.

4162387,32264451,2015-05-16,26071134,Lisa,My cousin came from the east coast and we drove from my home in Davis down to spend one night in the Blue House and then head to Big Sur.  The house was so lovely and just as it looks if not more lovely in the photos.  We immediately adored the space.  We loved the kitchen area and the town was amazing.  We joked about wanting to buy the little blue house... if only ;)
4162387,32524488,2015-05-19,10779609,Glenn & Vanessa,"My fiancée and I had an amazing time at the little blue house.  It was exactly as pictured and had a very DIY decor aesthetic that was really charming.  Everything we needed was provided minus groceries which were only a block away from our front door.  The area was very safe and quiet, and within walking distance from downtown.  I've read in other reviews that the cottage could be a little cold at night, but we had absolutely no problem keeping it warm with the furnace heater... It stayed nice and toasty throughout our stay. We will definitely be back!"

Joy is the most wonderful host, paying us a visit, making us feel very welcome with a gift of the 'famous choc chip cookies' from the local bakery and providing us with lot's of local knowledge to highlight our very special time in Ocean Grove.....we wish we could have stayed longer! Thanks Joy! "
4162387,33538181,2015-05-29,5212987,Leslie,Perfect little place to stay if you're in the Monterey area! Joy made it really easy to get in and I appreciated her recommendations RE: food and attractions in the area. Short walk to the strip of shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove.
4162387,33608549,2015-05-30,8681061,April,"The little blue house was an amazing place to stay. It is perfectly placed next to restaurants and a ton of shops within walking distance. We walked to Crema for breakfast and took a nice 20 minute walk to the Monterey Aquarium with our two children. The house is clean, comfortable and accommodated the 4 of us perfectly. We will definitely be coming back to the little blue house again when we are back in Monterey! "
4162387,34289718,2015-06-07,30303104,Dan,"The little blue house was adorable, and on a wonderful street walking distance to everything you could want. Joy's guidebook was an excellent resource to ensure our stay was packed full of awesome."
4162387,34964582,2015-06-14,10509700,David,"It was a real treat to have Joy host us at the Little Blue House. Her guidebook to Pacific Grove was spot on, and everything about the home was very welcoming. Of course, what really won us over were the complimentary cookies! If you are ever in the area, definitely check out Pavels Bakeri - we look forward to another trip back very soon!  :)"
4162387,35586797,2015-06-20,2378080,Amon,"We had a great stay in the apartment.  Its in a quiet, cute neighborhood with a few restaurants just down the block, and only another few blocks to the water.  The house is beautiful and full of character.  Its a bit small, but it fit the three of us well with one person on the pullout couch.  The kitchen could use a bit more--there's no microwave or instructions for the gas oven--and there's no dining table for a spread out meal.  Other than that, it was great and perfect for our visit.

Joy was also an awesome host.  Her advice was helpful and she's kind and warm.  I'd definitely go back!"
4162387,35934882,2015-06-23,10900613,Max,"The little blue house, was so cute and perfect for our drive up highway 1.  Joy was great, the house was perfect, I'm a great area and I'd highly recommend to anyone visiting. "
4162387,36055707,2015-06-24,3962732,Daniel,"Over all, pretty disappointed.  Dont get me wrong, the house itself is as advertised.  My issue is more with the cleanliness.  We normally dont give much thought to whether or not a place has been thoroughly cleaned however the shower was so filthy that my wife decided to do a little more looking.
We pulled back the covers and found sheets that has several long black hairs on them.  At this point my wife was freaked out and she refused to sleep in the bed.  She opted to sleep on the couch.
With the price being what it is, my wife selected this place as our romantic getaway.  Needless to say things didn't workout as Planned and we are leaving very disappointed.
I spoke to joy before arrival and got a good vibe from here.  I imagine if we were staying for more than 1 day, she would send someone over to clean to make us feel better.  But things being as they were, our 1 day stay was unsatisfying."
4162387,36120216,2015-06-25,33607713,Jane,"My sister, brother in law and I enjoyed our stay at the Little Blue House. The location was great, within walking distance of many attractions. The house itself was just as described - and even the sofa bed was very comfortable! The bathroom was nice (the shower was a bit small for my tall brother in law). Would stay here again."
4162387,36346994,2015-06-27,7393710,Emma & Manhattan,"The Little Blue House is fantastic.  The location is unbeatable, a short walk to all that Pacific Grove has to offer.  The house itself has everything you could possibly need, is clean, tidy, charming and filled with lovely personal touches from the original artwork to the beautiful hand-drawn guide to the area.  Joy is a dream to deal with, super relaxed and helpful and was kind enough to show us The Art House next door - also amazing!  It was lovely to meet her and  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
4162387,36419206,2015-06-28,12681279,Cynthia,"Cute home with clean linens and towels. It is a historic home, so the floors and doors do creak, but that's part of the charm. Easy check-in and check-out.  Parking was good and the home was convenient to popular spots in Pac Grove, Monterey, and Carmel."
4162387,36784927,2015-07-01,12587530,Diane,What a cute little house. Artistic touches and great recommendations.
4162387,37019278,2015-07-03,6738215,Leslie,The little blue house was perfect for our overnight stay.  It is in a perfect location to easily walk to town and to the aquarium.  Joy was very helpful and responsive.
4162387,37482027,2015-07-07,4975289,Bruce,"Our family loved staying at Joy's Lovely Little Blue House.  It was a bit cozy but still perfect for our family of four.  The interior was simple and functional and filled with Joy's own artwork and handiwork.   Beautiful stained glass fills half of the windows.   The Little Blue House is one block from Pacific Grove's restaurants, cafes and shops, and only a few blocks further from Monterey Bay.

The Little Blue House was exactly as listed and someplace we will definitely return to on our next trip to this areas. "
4162387,37695964,2015-07-09,8628944,Keith,"We might come back just to hang out with Joy again. The house is idyllic, the neighborhood sweet and friendly, and the dinner at Passionfish unforgettable. But the highlight of the trip was sitting in the backyard talking with our hostess, after she brought us chocolate chunk cookies. Can we please just move in?"
4162387,37832849,2015-07-11,11827396,Kellie,"Thank you Joy for having us in the Little Blue house. The house is gorgeous, comfortable and displays Joy's fabulous artistic talent. So close to the waterfront and a lovely shopping strip with cafes and restaurants. Pacific Grove is beautiful. We had everything we needed here. Checking in and out was simple. 
Highly recommended. "
4162387,38060098,2015-07-12,13277506,Daunish,"We really enjoyed our one night stay! We happened to meet Joy as we arrived and she was incredibly friendly and hospitable. 

The Little Blue House was very cute, comfortable and quiet. We walked down to the beach and got dinner on Saturday night because everything was so close! Would definitely stay in this neighborhood again - lots to explore."
4162387,38589610,2015-07-17,26930328,Frances,"Joy gave us a wonderful welcome. She remained easy to contact and available to answer queries throughout our stay. Pacific Grove is a special place with a historic atmosphere and a wonderful coastline. There's lots to do in the area. The Little Blue House is a charmer in a charming street. You are three minutes walk from the town centre and seven minutes to the beach. The interior of the house is as described, the main living room being comfortable, spacious and embellished with unique artwork. The wifi worked well as did the stove. The bedroom is adequate and the bed comfortable. The bathroom is very small with a particularly small shower box. The bathroom and bedroom areas feel ready for a deep level spring clean. The back garden is tiny and uncared for. However, we enjoyed our stay here and our encounters with the owner. "
4162387,38765042,2015-07-18,1999629,Melinda,"My two girlfriends and I stayed at the Little Blue house for one night to catch up with one another and relax. The house was just as described. It's in a super cute historical neighborhood in walking distance to shops, bike trails, the beach and restaurants. Joy was available and communicative the entire time, which was appreciated. The house is quite old but Joy has done a fabulous job preserving it's charm yet updating it for modern guests. The stained glass is gorgeous. I'd recommend staying here! My first stay in Pacific Grove was great! "
4162387,38856580,2015-07-19,22589712,Coral,Our experience at the Little Blue House was nothing short of wonderful. The house is conveniently located to all that Monterey has to offer. Joy is extremely responsive and helpful and makes the check in and out process a breeze. She even allowed for a late check out after we got back to the house a little late from a bike ride. Highly recommend!
4162387,39202395,2015-07-21,34494651,Floor,We absolutely loved our stay at the little blue house. It is very cosy and well equipped. The location is perfect and within a walking distance from restaurants and the beach. I would definitely recommend this place.
4162387,39385640,2015-07-23,32442649,Susan,Thanks Joy! It was a quick trip but you made it all so easy!
4162387,39557040,2015-07-24,19996144,Terry,Joy provide us a nice house to live in. We had an comfort stay. Recommend it!
4162387,39786709,2015-07-26,35966681,Matt,Joy was easy to work with. Kind and informative. House is small but clean and adorable. Perfect for 2. Close to coffee/breakfast/shops etc. easy bike to the aquarium and wharf. Thank you Joy!
4162387,40715624,2015-08-02,29032303,Dylan,"We had a great trip to this house.  It was as described and very cozy.  It has lots of windows and natural light making it a great place to hand out and relax.  It's super close to the beach at Lover's Point as well as lots of shops and restaurants.  Joy was courteous and a kind host.  She responded very promptly to all of our questions.  She lent us her kayak a couple times and we were able to explore the coastline without the pain of having to rent one.  

This was a great house and I would recommend it to anyone who's traveling in a pair or some smaller group!  My girlfriend and I stayed a week and were very comfortable the whole time.  "
4162387,40972333,2015-08-03,38259454,Stacie,"The little blue house and Joy were great! A lovely way to spend a night in Pacific Grove, we found the house cozy and well equipped. Joy's artistic touches make the home unique and create an inviting and memorable place to stay. We look forward to returning!
"
4162387,41394784,2015-08-07,621785,Sewellyn,"The Little Blue House is the perfect and authentic PG cottage. It took us back to Berkeley in the 1970', while still giving us a glimpse into the life of the traditional PG inhabitant. And the location could not be better. We were able to walk to the heart of downtown and around the town so easily.
As there were two of us -- friends -- we used both the regular queen bed and the futon, and both of us were very comfortable. The only challenge was sharing a small bathroom, with two women who carry a vast array of unguents. 
 Our hostess, Joy, was everything you would wish for in a hostess. She even delivered fabulous chocolate chip cookies and then responded to our late-night call for help lighting a pilot light within minutes. 
We really hope to have the opportunity to stay at The Little Blue House again."
4162387,41992028,2015-08-10,29661658,Connie,"The Little Blue House is walking distance to Lover's Point, a wonderful coffee house, a nice grocery store, and a cute movie theater.  I can't say enough about the community around this house.  I didn't want to leave. The house itself has everything you would expect of a home built in 1905- cute door nobs, wooden floor, apron windows, and cozy kitchen. Art, created by Joy, is decorating the home- it is beautiful!"
4162387,42463528,2015-08-13,39073638,Michael,"Beautiful house, loved the stained glass windows and art. Great location and Joy was very easy to deal with. Check in and check out a breeze. Definitely would recommend. "
4162387,42817313,2015-08-16,20064697,Kate,"The house is really cute and in a great location, right in the middle of Pacific Grove. Joy was very responsive with communication and left great recommendations. "
4162387,43061982,2015-08-17,30178606,Fred,the house is very beautiful and Joy is very warm-hearted.the guidebook is so lovely and covers everything.we had a perfect time here and would recommand it to others.
4162387,43273590,2015-08-18,14127944,Diane,"We loved Joy's charming Little Blue House. It is filled with Joy's collage fabric art work and beautiful stain glass windows. The house is in a quiet, safe neighborhood close to cafes, a wonderful book store, several thrift shops, and a movie theater. We'd love to return to Pacific Grove and the Little Blue House. "
4162387,43469257,2015-08-19,39295811,Tina,Joy's place is in good location as well as lots of surprises which made our stay really nice. This is my first stay with Airbnb and I was so happy about it. Joy was patient and awesome. Definitely come and uncover the surprises!
4162387,43534011,2015-08-20,866540,Holley,Charming house and a great location! Very welcoming host.
4162387,43659858,2015-08-21,31347961,Vladimir,"Joy has a beautiful, charming home. Her presentation is well thought out with handmade cards & maps of things to do locally. The house is charming, quaint, and exactly what we were looking for. Definitely recommend! Thanks again Joy!  "
4162387,43756172,2015-08-22,653156,James,"We loved Joy's cosy little beach house, decorated with original and beautiful art. Clean and equipped with all we needed whilst being conveniently located in the centre of Pacific Grove. If we come back to Monterey bay, we'll definitely be coming back to the little blue house."
4162387,44010767,2015-08-23,40050068,Michael,Joy did a great job and the listing was very accurate. The location was convenient and even though I only stayed for one night the listing had everything we needed. 
4162387,44370277,2015-08-25,24750295,Jenna,Adore this little blue house. Perfect in every way. Great neighborhood too- we loved walking everywhere! Would love to come back. House was super comfy cute and perfectly appointed. Thanks Joy!
4162387,44470959,2015-08-26,20601928,Lucy,"Lovely, seamless, bitchin! "
4162387,44799456,2015-08-29,15233829,Robert,"We had a lovely time at the Little Blue House. It's in the old, historic part of Pacific Grove, filled with charming blocks of cottages that date back to the town's origins as a ""tent city"" summer camp for Methodists. We walked to the beach, to fine restaurants along Lighthouse (we especially loved Jeninni), and to the Grove Market and Pavel's Backerei around the corner on Forest. We felt right at home in our cottage, with good books to read and colorful, playful art and furnishings crafted by the owner."
4162387,44932198,2015-08-30,16255090,Yolanda,The little blue house was charming and suited our needs perfectly. Joy was communicative and the entire transaction was easy and at our own pace. The house has all of the comforts of home and is in easy walking distance of so many great things to see and do. 
4162387,45676994,2015-09-05,3426213,Glen,We enjoyed the experience of your beautiful town and area. Thanks for the welcome cookies. Your house was perfect for us for the night.
4162387,45768499,2015-09-06,5089076,Kevin,We came to the Monterey area for a wedding and stayed at the little blue house. It was the perfect spot for us (three adults). The house is as described and could not have been any more cute. Joy was there to meet us when we arrived and was the perfect host. She was incredibly helpful and even provides a little house handbook to help with the house and surrounding area. We will definitely stay here again if we are back in the area. 
4162387,46176415,2015-09-08,41084811,Nicholas,The neighborhood was very charming.  The host was nice and informative.
4162387,46493974,2015-09-11,172010,Tina,"We loved staying at the Little Blue House. Great neighborhood, only a block from Lighthouse Ave. Only a few blocs to Lovers' Point and the beautiful bay. Gorgeous original stained glass windows. Wonderful artwork by the wonderful host, Joy. This was a fun and funky original Victorian cottage. Cozy, quirky, warm, just right."
4162387,46575937,2015-09-12,7616548,Kerstin,"Wonderful cottage in central Pacific Grove.  The cottage was exactly as described and comfortably fit our family of 2 adults and 2 kids.  The location is wonderful: we walked to the Red House Cafe, Pavel Bakery, and to the Pacific Grove triathlon early in the morning.  Joy was responsive and quick and was gracious to allow us a late check out so that we could shower after the triathlon.  Street parking was easy to find.  We will def stay here again!"
4162387,46732387,2015-09-13,7220292,Leigh,"The little blue how was everything we expected it to be. A small cozy home with a comfortable living area, a kitchen equipped with just what we needed, and a lovely bedroom. There were plenty of little things that brought a unique character to the home like a window curtain made from men's ties. The area was quiet and we felt instantly relaxed and at home in Joy's little blue house. Everything was provided that we needed and we had a great time. Within a 2-3 minute walk are excellent restaurants with a range of atmospheres. We'd highly recommend staying and would stay again if we're back in the area."
4162387,47131875,2015-09-15,10828270,Siobhan,"We enjoyed our stay in the Little Blue House.  We did not meet Joy but she had left good information re the area, restaurants etc. The house is ideally located just a few steps from the Main St in Specific Grove .  The art displays were truly lovely. The location is very safe and parking is not difficult.  However we were a bit disappointed with the manner in which the house was prepared.  It was not entirely clean esp the bathroom area.  The outdoor spaces are not usable and even the entrance area would benefit from good clean up.  Overall our feeling was that the Little Blue house needs a good makeover if it is to be offered as airbnb accommodation"
4162387,47422412,2015-09-18,43866805,Chris,"This spot in Pacific Grove is a great vacation location as everything you need is within walking range and the house is a good example of the local traditional style. Inside, everything we used was comfortable and worked well, including the wifi; shame there is no microwave. Décor is rather “student chic” but if we were going back to PG we would certainly consider staying again."
4162387,47669231,2015-09-21,24741446,Rich,My wife and I spent three days in the Little Blue House while we explored the area. It was perfect! Joy was such a great host and the house was everything we needed and more. It is very close to so many beautiful things and was the perfect home base for our explorations. Do yourselves a favor and eat at Passionfish in Pacific Grove. It is only a few blocks from the house and has beautiful food and wine. We had one of the best meals of our lives there. If we ever make it back to the Monterey peninsula we will definition try to stay at the Little Blue House again. 
4162387,48055070,2015-09-22,2073179,Mark,Brilliant little place and joy was very helpful with our last minute change. Totally recomended! Thankyou. 
4162387,48078081,2015-09-23,28822392,Suma,"We stayed here for one night. It was easy, the house was clean- couldn't have asked for more. The location is fantastic and we walked everywhere. The dinner recommendations are great- we ate at Passionfish. For travelers passing through Monterey, this place is exactly what we needed. "
4162387,48789925,2015-09-28,34995815,Jane,"The listing is exactly as described on Airbnb. Joy is very quick in responding to our questions. The area is very quite and very convenient at the same time. Just a couple of min. to the beach. Recommend. 
"
4162387,48867289,2015-09-29,19202486,Ting,The little blue house was warm and comfortable. We had a great night at Monterey and so surprised to find out that the house has 100+ years! 
4162387,51051035,2015-10-17,25073212,Marisa,"We loved staying in Joy's home! The check-in/check-out process was very simple, and Joy was extremely accommodating. Joy's house is in a great location. We were able to walk to Passionfish and enjoyed a delicious meal!"
4162387,51885201,2015-10-25,9705120,Pam,"I followed the clear directions that Joy left me and opened the door to The Little Blue House. I was greeted with a tidy, light-filled, little house graced with beautiful stained glass windows, clean and attractive furnishings complete with a lovely backyard area. Joy checked in with me in a timely manner and came by to say hello after I settled in a bit. Her attention to my needs was gracious and helpful. Her warm manner and introduction to a local bakery shook off all the woes of my travels. Mornings for me from that day throughout my stay started with a short walk to Fournier Bakery on Lighthouse Avenue that not only had organic coffee that passed my rigorous standards of 'good coffee' but a new experience - a Marionberry muffin. And when I went down with a bad cold, the bakery/cafe's homemade chicken noodle soup truly did for me what my grandmother's did - set me on the path of healing. The neighborhood is quiet with rows of colorful, tiny, board and batten cottages mixed with larger Victorian houses. When not in attendance at a writers’ retreat in Pacific Grove, I spent my free time seated by the window of The Little Blue House with the front door open writing and enjoying the sounds and sights of the birds and the feel of the warm sunshine.  Not only did I have a delightful time at my writers’ retreat, I got to be a part of the Pacific Grove community in a way that helped me appreciate the history, culture, and customs in the company of delightful, fun, and welcoming Pacific Grove residents. I look forward to my return to The Little Blue House."
4162387,52471881,2015-10-29,47389894,Carolina,"A lovely experience! Since I planned this trip last summer, my ideal place to stay was exactly like the little blue how is; cozy, clean, unique. Joy was an excellent host. We left Monterrey beach with a beautiful feeling."
4162387,53287085,2015-11-07,21535321,Sarah,"Fell in love with the place just based on the listing, but in person the place is even more enchanting. Quaint and quiet and close to a number of different places The Little Blue House was just lovely for a weekend getaway, would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area!"
4162387,53409761,2015-11-08,9102974,Mike,"What a great place!  Well kept, very cosy, and close to everything.  I loved it!"
4162387,54678208,2015-11-22,49285927,Amber,"We loved our stay at The Little Blue house. The listing was on point and met our every expectation. If you are envisioning a lavish hotel like stay with a deluxe bed, this might not be the right venue for you. Instead you can relax in an adorable charming California style cottage located in the PERFECT part of town. Insane shops and restaurants are only a walk away and the charming downtown of Carmel is an under $20 Uber ride away. We brought our own bikes and covered miles and miles of coastal bike paths in the mornings then headed to Carmel for lunch and cocktails in the afternoon. We highly recommend this Airbnb. "
4162387,54875848,2015-11-25,11841189,Mia,"We were very comfortable in The Little Blue House. The kitchen was perfect for cooking a couple meals, the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels, and the location was great, easy access to walk to the main restaurants and shops of Pacific Grove. Also very easy parking. "
4162387,55284635,2015-11-29,6314488,Jared,Very eclectic play and convenient to downtown. Was really cool living in s house that was from 1905. Highly recommend for somebody looking to get away
4162387,55471032,2015-12-01,17182369,John,"Great location, several good places to dine within walking distance.   Parking was in demand but I always found a spot on street very close to the house.   House is over 100 years old but in decent shape.  The hand-made ""owner's manual"" for the house was a nice touch, with very helpful information about nearby eateries and things to do, as well as tips for enjoying the house. I really appreciated the lack of pet hair/dander - I have allergies, so pets (especially cats) make it difficult for me to breathe. It was cold weather when I visited, the heater in the front room was hard pressed to warm the bedroom.  Luckily plenty of blankets were provided.  The bathroom was even colder, but the hot water made up for the cold air.  All in all, a very quiet, cozy bungalow.  Joy was very responsive to text messages and very upbeat.  If I stay again I will make it a point to meet her face to face.  "
4162387,56397265,2015-12-13,34268088,Glenn,Joy's Pacific Grove house was perfect for my stay. She was very easygoing and accommodating to my group's evolving needs. 
4162387,56932228,2015-12-20,11822459,Susie,The place was fabulous. Joy was a great hostess!! We look forward to returning. Completely charming place with wonderful art by Joy and beautiful stained glass windows. Thanks so much Joy!
4162387,57173698,2015-12-22,20418119,Robert,"Joy's place was perfect. It was just as described. On top of that, everything was clean and very nice and cozy. No complaints whatsoever, zero hassle and very intuitive getting into the place and getting out. Joy was very flexible with us and was very supportive of any of our needs. Bed was very firm and all of the furniture is nice and clean and cozy. We would love to come back again as our go-to plac e to stay in Pacific Grove!"
4162387,57253930,2015-12-23,559747,Roland,"Very charming cottage in a great location with lovely stained glass in the windows.  The bed was a little too firm, but otherwise we had lovely stay. "
4162387,57472465,2015-12-26,51062152,Jeannie,The house is adorable and Joy was wonderful and easy to work with.  She had a few good easy read books that my daughter and I both enjoyed.  
4162387,57931433,2015-12-30,5233027,Catherine,"Even though we had to cancel our time in Carmel, Joy was very understanding and kind about our circumstances changing. She is very easy to communicate with as a host and always swift in her responses. I wish I could have met her because she strikes me as a very warm and genuine person. "
4162387,58336412,2016-01-02,32373080,Tracy,"Joy was terrific! We arrived and everything was taken care of, it was easy as pie to check in. All of the blankets were ready to go, there was a coffee pot, and the place was so welcoming. The Little Blue house is a fantastic location in Pacific grove, just a few steps away from the main strip with adorable shops and restaurants. Just a few blocks from the beach. It's on a peaceful and quiet street, and the house is super charming and clean."
4162387,58822668,2016-01-05,33500283,Jiani,The house was adorable. 
4162387,59350649,2016-01-09,35349432,Amanda,"Joy made staying at the Little Blue House an absolute pleasure! The home as exactly as describe and we enjoy just spending time in the house and reading. We will be back and will also be recommending Joy's Little Blue house to friends and family!
"
4162387,59911739,2016-01-17,23428125,Brad,"Sent my wife and sister-in-law to spend the weekend in the Monterey area for a girls' getaway. 

They said the house is perfectly appointed for a weekend getaway and is situated within walking distance of everywhere you would want to be in Pacific Grove!

Communication with Joy and access to the house were very easy and we would definitely recommend this place to friends!"
4162387,60326571,2016-01-22,3158802,Andrew,"We had a lovely experience at The Little Blue House. It was our first trip away with newborn, just to see how we did. I didn't know much about Pacific Grove (only noting it was near to Monterrey), but it was lovely. The house was as described and is ideal for a couple (+1 or 2). The furnace is really good, the place warmed up in no time (we were there in winter). 

On our way out we met Joy and she was delightful. She gave us some really great advice about our child (it is her profession). It really topped off our lovely visit perfectly."
4162387,60939295,2016-01-29,43459383,Joe,"The hostess added a personal touch to nearly every detail in the home, which made it feel familiar and restfull.
Time seemed to stay with me during my much needed Spiritual retreat. I awakened feeling as if I had been away for a week.
Quiet, cozy, clean, convenient, organized, nastalgic, and worth visiting again. 
Downtown Pacific Grove is a 2 min walk, and even has a movie theater. Town was beautifully lit at night.
Thank you for filling this blue house with the warmth of your love and creativity.
"
4162387,61002440,2016-01-30,21337700,Nora,"Joy's house is great for a cozy night near Carmel. Little touches like the curtain made out of neckties or a cow-shaped kettle give the place character. Joy was super sweet and graciously flexible in allowing us to check out a little late. Both beds were not the most comfortable in the world so I'd suggest replacing the mattresses, and the house is close to a downtown area so we could hear some late-night owls walking up and down the street, but for the price and charm of the place I was happy overall! Thank you Joy!"
4162387,62268298,2016-02-13,19308934,Aisha,The place was clean and cute.  A little complication on the address but no complaints.
4162387,62692236,2016-02-16,363583,Amanda,"I could not have been more happy here. Wow! Joy is awesome. We met up with her for a short conversation when we arrived, and she was outstandingly helpful and accommodating. The cottage is 100% charming and was exactly right for our little family. The town and its natural beauty are very accessible from this spot, and I sincerely wish we could have stayed longer. I recommend it highly!"
4162387,62959528,2016-02-18,59042359,Craig,"Joy's little blue house was the perfect place for myself, my wife, and our baby. The house was very cozy with everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The place was beautiful and Joy had left a little book of recommendations that were spot on. The location of the listing was ideal.... walking distance to all the best of Pacific Grove... including a great playground for our daughter. Joy was super prompt in getting back to us and accommodating with our arrival and stay....we will definitely be back. "
4162387,63042358,2016-02-19,58865757,Stephanie,My family of four loved the home.  It was hard to get my young daughters to leave the place.  We are looking forward to visiting  again.  The neighborhood was quiet.  The home was located within walking distance to restaurants and the ocean.  It was so nice to just park the car and enjoy the surroundings.  The home is very cozy and has a lot of charm.  Joy was very accommodating and responsive.
4162387,63194179,2016-02-21,39298844,Chloe,"We had a great time at Joy's house. The living room is very cozy. The house fits perfectly the description and was very clean. Joy is a very responsive host.
Everything was perfect, and the location is great.
Highly recommendable!!"

4162387,63929327,2016-02-28,3997405,Andy,The little blue house was charmingly simple/cozy with tons of great stuff in walking distance. Highly recommended! 
4162387,64447994,2016-03-04,35710222,Vanessa,Loved the little blue house. It was charming and exactly as expected. Close to everything and in a safe/adorable neighborhood. I would highly recommend this to someone looking to stay in a cozy and unique house versus a hotel.
4162387,64713203,2016-03-06,2365333,Jarrett,Joy had a beautiful place that made us feel at home. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay a night in Monterey. She was very responsive for any questions I had and instructions had been put together nicely. 
4162387,65267172,2016-03-12,60837718,Hal,"The listing was very accurate and lived up to our expectations. The house is adorable, in a great location, and very quiet.  We had everything we needed for our romantic getaway."
4162387,65636429,2016-03-16,15146527,Patricia,We loved the Little Blue House and the neighborhood. It was exactly as described. Joy left a clever handmade booklet with info about some local places to visit and a little history about the house. Check in and out was extremely easy. We would definitely stay again.
4162387,65912447,2016-03-17,38040964,Victor,"Awesome time at the Little Blue house. Walking distance to everything. The beach, and resturants. Joy was an awesome host and made my family and I feel welcomed. Looking forward to our next visit."
4162387,66021061,2016-03-18,34606043,Aaron,"We enjoyed staying in the Little Blue House on a quick trip through Monterrey.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and a short walk to some great restaurants and cafes, as well as bike rentals down near the beach.  We easily parked on the street, and check-in was flexible.  Joy provided a nice handmade map of the neighborhood with select restaurants and points of interest labeled on it.  The bed was comfortable, plenty of hot water, thats about all you need to get out and see the town!"
4162387,66283303,2016-03-20,4483885,Avi,Great little quiet spot just blocks from the beach. Joy met us when we arrived and was very helpful in suggesting local restaurants and sights.  
4162387,66609439,2016-03-23,15622753,Lauren,The little blue house was very beautiful - joys artwork is gorgeous. The house is incredibly close to the shops and cafes of pacific grove and also the coast full of dolphins and seals and otters to watch. Lovely place to stay!
4162387,67000395,2016-03-26,41078483,Fatima,Joy made us feel at home. The neighborhood is a delight and the Little Blue House was a perfect place to stay. 
4162387,67750862,2016-03-31,2525676,Kate,"Blissful calm, blooming flowers, and a soft Pacific breeze greeted us when we arrived at the Little Blue House. The house itself is so charming and comfortable. Street parking was easy and Joy left us with a number of recommendations for restaurants, cafes, and walks nearby. Joy was quick to respond to any texts we sent during our stay, but also left us plenty of space to relax and enjoy at our own pace. I only wish we could have stayed longer! Next time, for sure. I cannot recommend The Little Blue House highly enough. "
4162387,68438247,2016-04-05,52404605,Hugh,"This house is really cute and has a very interesting history.  It's location is extremely convenient to the main shopping streets and beaches in Pacific Grove.  However, while most of the house's facilities were adequate we felt that the bathroom was a little grotty, the shower in particular was off-putting.  Similarly the garden, which could have been a major attribute, was overgrown and very unloved.  There was a shortage of light bulbs which we asked Joy to address but she didn't get back.  Perhaps she didn't get the message.  Overall we felt this was a nice place but for the price we paid we expected a higher standard.  "
4162387,68686004,2016-04-06,53356894,Noelle,"Pacific Grove is a quaint little town and this house encompasses the feel of the neighborhood. Not to mention, Joy was great and helped us feel welcome! It was somewhat expensive for what we actually received, the house is run down and the shower was small. I probably would have rather stayed at a nearby hotel for the cost."
4162387,68755429,2016-04-06,3102921,Chrissi,"The Little Blue House ist ein kleines, gemütliches, historisches Häuschen. Es war etwas klein für drei Erwachsene, für zwei sicher perfekt. Das Bad war etwas eng und schief, recht rustikal. Ansonsten war alles sehr künstlerisch, fröhlich und liebevoll eingerichtet. Joy hat alle Fragen sehr freundlich per Mail beantwortet, und uns einen kleinen, künstlerisch gestalteten Leitfaden, mit allen relevanten Informationen zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr hübsch, super zentral gelegen, und trotzdem ruhig. Die Gegend um Pacific Grove ist wunderschön. Der Strand ist fußläufig zu erreichen!"
4162387,69164514,2016-04-09,3915685,Terral,"We very much enjoyed staying at The Little Blue House this weekend. The home is a nice size with a very convenient location. We really enjoyed spending time in the neighborhood and walking around. The photos taken by Joy are very accurate so definitely take the time to look through them. The living area is a great size and very comfortable. We found the bedroom and bathroom to be a little less so, though. The bathroom was a bit grimey and the bed was somewhat uncomfortable. The place certainly got the job done, though if location is your top priority!"
4162387,70472349,2016-04-18,9986988,Rachel,"We had a fabulous time at the little blue house - so cute and clean, beautiful neighborhood, and a welcoming (and delicious) box of treats waiting for us upon arrival.  Will definitely return!"
4162387,71206868,2016-04-24,7500618,Jasdeep,"Our stay was very short, but the Little Blue House was exactly as described, and the decorations (including Joy's own artwork!) are very charming. The handmade instruction booklet was exactly what was needed for getting settled quickly. Would definitely rent this place again for properly exploring Pacific Grove/Monterey on longer visit."
4162387,71743771,2016-04-28,8107119,Rui,Joy's place was clean and very very well appointed. Highly recommend.

4162387,72265452,2016-05-01,16396944,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I headed down to Monterey to celebrate my birthday by skydiving over the beautiful coast. After a brief stint at 18,000ft we headed over to Joy's little blue house. A great little spot and walking distance to restaurants / cafes. "

4162387,73440615,2016-05-08,19340091,Ciarán,"Joy's place is incredible. The living room sofa bed kicks bum! This place easily accommodated 3. I will definitely stay here again. Great location. 
Shower pressure/temp great!"

4162387,74531897,2016-05-15,6883640,Cynthia,"The Little Blue House was just as described. Location was great, close to the lighthouse and downtown restaurants.

4162387,75109583,2016-05-19,35436824,Stephanie,"Joy's cottage was a very pleasant, quiet and well located place to stay while exploring Pacific Grove and the surrounding area. Joy was a great host and made us feel very welcome. I would recommend staying here."
4162387,75396085,2016-05-21,59593544,Andrew,"House was a cute little bungalow, nothing fancy, but the location was great, just a few blocks from the ocean and some really good restaurants. "
4162387,75793022,2016-05-23,6893485,Jenna,"Joy's place was cute and comfortable and in a great location - walking distance to restaurants and the beach and a short drive to the aquarium, 17-mile drive, Carmel, and Point Lobos. We had a great stay!"
4162387,75881342,2016-05-23,73095333,Phillip,"Beautiful little neighborhood. A lot of little cafes and coffee shops to eat at. a nice little home for two . I met Joy and she was very nice. Loved the swing open windows! I recommend eating at ""Hulas"" if your around town for a bit. "
4162387,76463623,2016-05-27,45309725,Fan,"Joy's house is very special and comfortable. The town is very nice. If you are planing to visit 17 mile, her house is a good option. Very close to the north entrance of 17 mile"

4162387,77822956,2016-06-03,7009391,Patrick,We had a wonderful time in the Little Blue House. It was a very cute place and enjoyed our stay in the beautiful Monterey Bay area.
4162387,77974591,2016-06-04,8536207,Maureen And Gary,Joy came quickly to help us get the key to working to open up The Little Blue House. The location is really good for morning & evening walks in 2 directions along the ocean. We enjoyed eating & shopping in the peaceful quiet that is Pacific Grove. The house suited us because my friend & I eached had a separate sleeping place. It was quiet & we slept well.
4162387,78646724,2016-06-08,9538744,Aislinn,We loved our stay at The Little Blue House! It was small and perfect for our needs. Even though there's no parking we had an easy time finding a spot on the street. Joy had a cute little booklet telling us all about the house and surrounding area and it was nice to have that personal touch.  
4162387,78906499,2016-06-10,67078210,Emay,"Joy's description is very precise. Location is good, place is cozy and clean, decorated with unique and creative art pieces made by Joy herself. Joy is very flexible and friendly, even I didn't get chance to meet her, but she is responsive, and easy to communicate with.
I would definitely recommend her place, and I am sure I would be back to stay in the little blue house."
4162387,79049119,2016-06-11,14700892,Bronny,Gorgeous house! We loved the special booklet Joy has made giving tips on how to make the most of the area. The house was comfortable and private. Easy to locate and close to everything. Really cute and highly recommend. Joy was also a pleasure to deal with.
4162387,79353496,2016-06-12,16802170,Julie & Scott,"My husband very much enjoyed Joy's Little Blue House.  Clean & quaint, and best of all, walking distance to participate in Pacific Grove Triathlon, and easy access to local eateries. Joy was friendly, informative and helpful. "
4162387,80193862,2016-06-16,14326178,Qingyuan,The house is a short walk away from the Lover's Point and many great restaurants on Lighthouse Avenue. Joy responded to all our questions extremely quickly.
4162387,80845973,2016-06-20,2410860,Leda,The description was pretty accurate. It was really cold at night though.
4162387,81242526,2016-06-21,70568857,Alex,Joy was a great host! Move in was super easy and the house was exactly what the description said. She stopped by and was so friendly to us. Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling through.  
4162387,81464236,2016-06-23,53104467,Linda,"We did not meet our host, but there was a little booklet with info on our lodgings and nearby restaurants.  Cute neighborhood, in walking distance of restaurants and shops.  The Little Blue House had a rustic charm, with personal artwork of the host.  "
4162387,81833413,2016-06-25,31332313,Linda,We were in touch with Joy before we even arrived and  she answered all our questions about everything from kayaking to parking to dining!
4162387,82669547,2016-06-28,28332877,Katy,"A great, easy base to stop off at if travelling the West coast. Pacific Grove is very peaceful and has some interesting alternative American seaside architecture. "
4162387,83002521,2016-06-30,21244025,Ellen,"Super cute little house in cozy neighborhood. The house was creatively decorated with art made by the host. She had also made a little hand written book with information about the house and the area. Joy was also really helpful and a problem fixer as an unexpected event occurred. Only stayed one night, but wished we could have stayed longer. "

4162387,83966659,2016-07-04,56486098,Marissa,"Joy was lovely. She left us a booklet with history of the area, suggested spots and restaurants to visit, and more. The neighborhood was sleepy but nice, walking distance to shops, restaurants, and a great quick walk to the oceanfront promenade. "
4162387,84308017,2016-07-06,28520320,Zachary,"We loved our stay at the Little Blue House. The description was accurate to the accommodations and Joy left a key for us for an easy check in. Location was great, short walk to everything, just over a mile to the aquarium and a section of coast line where seals are always hanging out. Thanks Joy, we really enjoyed our stay. "
4162387,84658076,2016-07-08,73186357,Megan,Check-in was a breeze! I loved not having to schedule a time to meet with the host since it is difficult to estimates arrival times on driving trips. The neighborhood was cute and we were able to get parking very close. The host left great resturant recommendations.
4162387,85445703,2016-07-11,80523954,Philip,The Little Blue House is a perfect getaway spot. Joy was quick to answer any questions and the decor is one of a kind!

I love the original Victorian details. 

Joy is a very welcoming hostess. Communication and check-in are excellent. 

We plan to return next year!"

We spent one night at the little blue house. It was very cozy and perfect for our needs. Joy even offered a pack n play for our toddler. We enjoyed playing games in the evening and had no complaints overall. Joy was very responsive to my questions. Pacific Grove is a charming little community and we really enjoyed our time there. "
4162387,91258749,2016-08-04,68466797,Leonie,"Joy's kleines blaues Haus ist sehr schön und historisch. Die Lage ist super. 5 Minuten zu Fuß zum Pazifik und ein idealer Ausgangspunkt für den 17-Mile-Drive, den wir mit dem Fahrrad erkundet haben. 
Für unsere Ansprüche hätte die Unterkunft - besonders das Bad und der Kühlschrank - sauberer sein können. Im
Kühlschrank lagen noch einige Saucen und auch der Wein von den Vorgängern. Nett gemeint, aber leider weiß man nicht wie alt die Lebensmittel sind. 
Weiterer negativer Punkt ist, dass das WLAN bei uns leider nicht funktioniert hat. "
4162387,91630897,2016-08-06,50496871,Yuanqiang,"The house is lovely and clean. It's our second time here. Every time's stay was so wonderful. Thanks Joy, she is very helpful."
4162387,92495082,2016-08-08,15464495,Brian,The little blue house was great. A very quite area walking distance to the beach and good eats in Pacific Grove.  Joy was nice enough to loan us her kayak for the afternoon.

My parents and I love it!! I wish I would booked one more night. Joyce is so nice, she respond to all my message. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to west coast of the states :) "
4162387,94945217,2016-08-17,268210,Ann,Joy could not have been more hepful with suggestions and advice. We loved the house which is comfortable and full of character. Hope to return!

4162387,99728689,2016-09-05,5987069,David,Little blue house is an authentic stay central in pacific grove. The house has a lor of history and joy made it a warm home. For us the location was perfect. Even the aquarium is within walking distance. 
4162387,100246133,2016-09-08,20691700,Giulia,We really loved the Little Blue House. Great location and everything was as expected. 
4162387,101519521,2016-09-13,73561585,Ralph,"A neglected and dowdy property not my idea of 'a beautiful Victorian cottage' our view was that this property would benefit from better security ,some windows front and back had no catches or locks at all and could be opened from the outside with ease, front and back doors also lacked adequate locks .
Our first impression on entering was that it bore little or no resemblance to the reviews which were mostly positive,not our idea of cosy with pieces of material that barely covered the windows.
The two light fittings in the living area all had different light bulbs of which only 3 out of 6 worked, we noted this had been pointed out in an April booking.
The bed was uninviting and uncomfortable.
The bathroom was very neglected and not particularily clean, toiletry items from previous occupiers had been left and not removed.
The rear garden was scruffy with rubbish and building materials laying about.
On the whole an extremely disappointing experience,totally not worth the money we paid."
4162387,102082921,2016-09-16,13549188,Keng Fun,"This place has a great location and is very quaint. The wifi works great, and the arrival to get into the cottage was smooth. Joy communicates well and there are lots of brochures/books about PG in the property. But we didn't find it clean enough at arrival so Joy offered to refund the cleaning fee. Suitable if you are not particular about cleanliness, everything you need in working order or good quality pillows and mattress. "
4162387,102546583,2016-09-18,76010154,Alex,"Joy clearly communicated everything we desired to know. Easy checkin and checkout. For city folks the parking would probably be considered excellent. Street parking within a couple hundred feet was always available. House is decorated inside with artistic flair and warmth. Loved Joy's personal ""onsite manual"" and food suggestions. I'm going back to Monterey next week and hope to try the Thai place she suggested. Shopping is VERY close, easy walk."
4162387,103484719,2016-09-22,10536293,Anita,Sweet little Victorian cottage.  Comfortable and cozy.  Very close to downtown restaurants and shops.

4162387,107223382,2016-10-09,61959151,Julie,"The host was very timely with her communication.  She also offered many good suggestions for local restaurants.  The house is cute and in a great location for walking to shops and dining.  Unfortunately, the attention to detail and pride of ownership is not present.  A lime wedge was in a glass on the shelf.  Coffee grounds and food were in and around the sink.  Dirty sponges were left to clean the dishes.  Multiple lightbulbs were missing, including 2 out of 3 in the bathroom.  (This was also a complaint made by a renter in April.) Towels and sheets were tired looking.  Mattress was very uncomfortable. Simple upgrades would make a huge difference."
4162387,108310069,2016-10-15,5509183,Trine,"Joys lille hus er virkelig hyggeligt og helt som beskrevet. Joy var virkelig sød og gjorde alt for, at vi fik et godt ophold."

You can see that much thought was taken in decorating the place. It is close by restaurants and the neighborhood was a delight to walk around. We will definitely be back. 
4162387,111559815,2016-10-31,66841444,Sarah,"Adorable, comfortable and so close to everything. Wonderful host as well. Very accommodating! "
4162387,112797599,2016-11-07,1615671,Danielle,"Great location (love PG) and communication with Joy was swift. House could use some updating, but overall, enjoyed our stay. "
4162387,113137714,2016-11-10,20310567,Erica,We stayed in Joy's house for one night during our trip exploring the California coast and enjoyed it. It was a very cozy space and was located near some great restaurants and bars. We hope to return to explore the area in more depth!
4162387,113404050,2016-11-12,102767053,Andrea,"This cottage is the perfect jumping off place for exploring Monterey and the surroundings. The location is amazing - a short hop to the eateries and shores of Pacific Grove, and a lovely mile long walk/cycle along the waterfront to the aquarium. The cottage itself is cozy and charming."
4162387,115209610,2016-11-22,61600,Liza,"Joy's place is very very cute, and she is so kind and creative. Pacific Grove is a wonderful spot and we had a great visit with our two year old who loved ""her little blue house!"""
4162387,115317622,2016-11-23,94241792,Johanna,"Very cute and unique cottage. Worked well for me, my husband and our two daughters. Easy to walk to downtown and the beach. We really enjoyed our one night stay! Joy was very easy to communicate with. "
4162387,115739352,2016-11-26,7275089,Weston,"The little blue house is a dream. Cozy, quiet, close to shops and restaurants and a breathtaking seaside park and great access to the stunning Highway 1! Joy made everything easy, we used the kitchen daily (including thanksgiving dinner), and loved the location. Perfect place if you like an easy, charming, cozy place with personality. Miss it already!"
4162387,120755572,2016-12-11,102091854,Daniel,"This was the perfect cozy get away for my girlfriend and myself. Walking distance to many restaurants/coffee houses in the area. A nice walk to the aquarium along the coast as well. 
It was a treat to stay in a historic (built in 1905!) home near the coast, would definitely stay here again!"
4162387,122029980,2016-12-20,29666500,Ruogu,"Nice and lovely place to live, fit for a family of three. Kitchen is very convenient to use and the house is filled with old-fashion styled stuff, very impressive. Only thing to note is that it might be a little bit cold in the winter night, be sure to make the bed warm before sleeping."
4162387,123543688,2016-12-29,5818364,Anne,This little rustic house is close to restaurants and the beach. Parking is a little hard due to the one way street. Joy is a great communicator and very flexible.
4162387,123968530,2016-12-31,26553043,Jason,"We enjoyed our stay here, the home is delightful with its artistic touches.  We were here in probably the coldest week of the year so it was a challenge staying warm in the old home but we managed.  In all, it was a nice experience.  "
4162387,124381565,2017-01-01,18067665,"Jim,Stacey,Gary,Lynea,Amy,&Michael","Joy was a wonderful host! Her cottage is perfectly located to enjoy everything Pacific Grove has to offer. I highly recommend her beautiful, sweet cottage. "
4162387,125252438,2017-01-04,17425219,Isaac,Super cute home that's centrally located to all you'll need in Pacific Grove. Easy 1 mile walk to the aquarium and Cannery Row.  Joy is sweet and answers any questions you may have. Highly recommend!
4162387,126007286,2017-01-08,92053027,Amber,Cottage is lovely and full of charming little touches. Felt like stepping back in time! 
4162387,126421745,2017-01-11,28858125,Roger,"Our all too brief overnight stay at The Little Blue House was very nice indeed and we wished it could have been longer. Excellent location on a quiet street but minutes away by foot to shops, cafes, friendly thrift stores and the ocean (where in the space of five minutes there appeared a rainbow, harbour seals playing in the surf by the water's edge and spouting whales in the distance! Pretty awesome).  The accommodation was cosy and delightful, and all communication was warm, helpful and instantaneous. Happily recommend and would stay here again. "
4162387,127239182,2017-01-16,95061944,Daniel,"Joy's place is a quiet, comfortable place to stay which is perfect for two. It's close to shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove as well as a small walk to Cannery Row in Monterey. Highly recommend."
4162387,128435920,2017-01-24,52127166,Carl,"Joy is wonderfully responsive and the location is amazing. The cottage was cozy, charming and eclectic. The description is very accccurate, it is a 1905 cottage that had been marginally modernised. "
4162387,131770809,2017-02-13,18685512,Todd,The house is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go.  We would definitely stay here again. 
4162387,132083258,2017-02-15,1145134,Amber,"Joy's place was so cute and lovely! Great location, everything you need including games. No TV but that's great! "
4162387,132228078,2017-02-16,18040158,Alexander,Really enjoyed the stay at Joy's. The house is beautiful and has many thoughtful touches. It's located very conveniently to exploring Monterey and the surrounding area by foot and by car. Joy is very responsive and easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend staying here. 
4162387,133172400,2017-02-20,113453476,Kristin,"The Little Blue House is located just feet from the Mainstreet with coffee shops, restaraunts, bookstores etc. And the house itself was more beautiful than I imagined! Very cute and cozy :) Would highly recommend it."
4162387,135179282,2017-03-03,5790233,Reed,"If you have ever wondered what those lovely historic Pacific Grove cottages look like inside, this is your chance! Charming, comfortable and creative. We loved staying here and look forward to our next trip."
4162387,136444691,2017-03-10,119049158,Jacky,Great for an old-school feel. The house itself is quite old but it will provide a very homey vibe!
4162387,138040215,2017-03-18,109254617,Donna,"We loved everything about Joy's place...where to begin?
First...Joy was a (ok I was gonna say she was a joy, but that'd be too cheesy, but she was) an amazing host! Helpful, hospitable and approachable. And not intrusive! One reason we'll go back is Joy. 
Second...location! 5-10 minute walk to Monterey Bay and 10-20 amazing eateries. Walk out the front door, look to your right and you see the bay. Except for day trips we walked everywhere we went. Pacific Grove is such a sweet town. Very non- commercial, not a chain store or restaurant in sight. All local!
Third...the house. Clean, comfortable and eclectic, in an awesome way! Super comfortable beds with plenty of blankets, a kitchen if you're so inclined, a tiny (and portable) but powerful electric fireplace to warm with if it gets chilly. 
Fourth...location, kinda like #2, but on a bigger scale. When we weren't walking around the immediate area we went; a) Whale watching, amazing to see these magnificent creatures in their environment (hint- DRESS WARM, no, we mean really warm); b) 17 Mile Drive-amazing scenery along the coast within a 15 minute drive; c) Pacific Coast Highway to Big Sur...amazing, words and pics can't begin to describe it; d) San Francisco and Muir Woods. Both amazing on opposite ends of the spectrum. 
All in all, in case you can't tell, Joy's place is the place to stay. "
4162387,138406051,2017-03-19,53990422,Emily,The cottage is so relaxing and charming. 
4162387,139298381,2017-03-24,114867627,Megan,"Great location, walking distance to everything! "
4162387,140762647,2017-03-31,101146236,Jane,Great location. House and furnishings a bit rustic for my taste. Shower very small. Great recommendations for local restaurants. 
4162387,140982162,2017-04-01,119367155,J,"This lovely cottage provided the perfect retreat! It is tucked into a quiet neighborhood, but close to all amenities. The bed and couch-bed were both comfortable and the artistic touches made the place feel special.  We were delighted with the location - just a half block from our favorite restaurant, Fandango, and a short walk down the block to all the shops and restaurants.  Joy was responsive and easy to work with. We will definitely stay here again!"
4162387,141312070,2017-04-02,27380110,Karen,"Quintessential Pacific Grove...quirky, cute, historic. Great location, walkable to main street shops and restaurants. Very relaxing; quiet, comfy and clean. "
4162387,141937169,2017-04-05,116600942,Kathie,"I absolutely loved this place! It was quiet and felt very safe. Basic living arrangements, which I loved. Close to the ocean, and the worlds best chocolate chunk cookie store :) Can't wait to book it again."
4162387,148860668,2017-05-01,50487659,Lorri,Joy is a fantastic hostess.  The place is adorable and walkable to many restaurants.  Very convenient for us.  We were in town for the Big Sur Marathon.  There is still an issue of cleanliness in house.  
4162387,149318030,2017-05-03,67114563,Mark,"Cute place, great location!  Bed and shower are a bit cramped but all else made it all worthwhile."
4162387,151649764,2017-05-13,4447296,Charlie,"If you're looking for a unique and personal place to stay, look no further. Joy was a delight to chat with, and she knows the history of Pacific Grove like no other. Bonus: walking distance to a cafe + bookstore with a large Steinbeck collection!"
4162387,152461073,2017-05-16,20337099,Joanna,"Cute, quaint and friendly describes Pacific Grove and the little Blue House. We had such a wonderful time window shopping and eating all within close walking distance from the house. The coast is a 10 minute walk and it's gorgeous! We loved seeing the mother seals and their pups sunning themselves on the beach. 
Just FYI, the bed isn't great so if you have a bad back you should take that into account. Though, Joy came over and helped my aching back with her trigger point massage which really helped.
We definitely look forward to coming back to Pacific Grove and the Little Blue House!"
4162387,154013008,2017-05-22,41031778,Ruxin,"It's such a lovely house! Great for small families and couples. 
- Great location, very quiet neighborhood, nice restaurants around the corner of the street, walking distance to Lover's point; 
- Easy to check-in and check out; 
- Great communication, Joy responded to messages within seconds;
- would highly recommend this place!"
4162387,154490268,2017-05-24,94521066,Alex,"Adorable cottage right in the middle of Pacific Grove. Easy walking into town and you could walk to Monterey as well (about a mile). Joy was a great host, she gave lots of recommendations for restaurants which were all great (seriously, some of our favorite meals of the trip!). Highly recommend!"
4162387,154682324,2017-05-25,86442260,Robert,Relaxing quiet place.
4162387,156467469,2017-05-30,118697945,Heather,"Very quiet, lovely cottage. Close to shopping and eateries."
4162387,156934125,2017-06-01,8029720,Steve,Joy's place is in a great location. It is walkable to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the beautiful coastline. Her place had everything we needed and we would gladly stay here again. 
4162387,157716428,2017-06-04,18895144,Tim,"Comfortable, centrally located and attractive setting. The host community and nearby eating establishments were surely and added plus. Enjoyed our 2 day visit to Pacific Grove."
4162387,158619584,2017-06-07,4074760,Kellie,"We did a quick night in Little Blue House when driving the PCH. It was a perfect stop. The property is cute, had just what we needed, and was close enough to walk to shops & restaurants, and to watch the sunset from Lovers Point. Accurate and just like the description, and all the personal touches Joy has included in the property make it a cozy and fun place to stay. "
4162387,159117449,2017-06-09,13420839,Kate,"The upside of this cottage is definitely the location- just a two block walk to the Main Street in Pacific Grove, and the fabulous host- very accommodating and charismatic. 

However we were disappointed with the cleanliness of the cottage and quality of the bed, the linens and the shower. The 'fenced-in backyard' was a big let-down. The plants were so overgrown and there was broken glass scattered so we couldn't even enjoy the advertised space.  "
4162387,159347434,2017-06-10,22028051,Daisy,Great place just bummed we didn't get wifi
4162387,159856929,2017-06-11,42514128,Callie,"Very cute little place, close to everything you'd need. Joy was readily available for any need that may arise"
4162387,160160273,2017-06-12,57063324,Amanda,"I'm kind of surprised how many amazing reviews this place has. Thats why I booked it. Unfortunately we didn't have as great of an experience. The place is cute and quaint. The location is great, close to the bay, and parking is easy. However, the cleanliness is a problem. I'm not a clean freak by any means, but this place needs a deep clean. The coffee maker was so dirty we spent 30 minutes cleaning it only to decide it was still too gross to use and we had to try to improvise for our morning coffee. The area around the sick was also dirty. We tried to use the oven only to have the fire alarm go off twice despite no burning or smoke. All in all, cute old house, but needs to be kept up better. I wouldn't stay here again. "
4162387,160820420,2017-06-15,129820748,Andrew,"The Little Blue House was a treasure to stay in, and Joy the host was one of the best people we met on the trip :)"
4162387,162124285,2017-06-19,93744327,Derek,We stayed here with our 5 month old son and it was perfect for us!  The location was incredible with great restaurants and beaches within a quick walk.  We enjoyed the 20 minute scenic walk to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row as well.  The neighborhood was quiet and Joy was very responsive and we even got to meet her!  Cute little old house that sure beats a hotel room!
4162387,163167991,2017-06-23,16400025,Aina,"Lovely cottage – completely charming in a great neighbourhood. Close to shops, restaurants and seaside walks. We stayed at home one night and cooked and sat in the cute yard, walked the local streets and just felt like we should have been there much longer. Joy had left a beautiful personal recommendation guide that we followed, as well as interesting historical info about the house. Wish we could have stayed longer!
"
4162387,163845766,2017-06-25,2365028,Katie,"Couldn't ask for a better location!  Joy's place is just up the street from the beach and the cute shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove.  It's the perfect spot if you just need somewhere to sleep - the bed was cozy and the street is quiet.  Joy was a great host - check in was easy and just as described.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the other reviews about cleanliness.   "
4162387,167680377,2017-07-07,23455562,Russel,"Joy's Little Blue House was everything we could have asked for.  The stay was perfect.  This is definitly a return destination.  I was so pleased with this stay, and all of our experiences.  I can't wait to return."
4162387,168076676,2017-07-08,129876550,Shelby,"The Little Blue House is a lovely piece of history. We enjoyed both its charm and its location to Pacific Grove and Monterey, to which we were able to explore on both foot and bike. While there, we checked out the lighthouse, Alvarado Brewing Company (great beer and food!), the sweet shops in Pacific Grove, the otters at Lover's Point, and 17 Mile Drive. "
4162387,171101028,2017-07-16,129488723,Aimee,Beautiful blue historic house in a great area. Everything is as described and Joy was a wonderful host.
4162387,173059499,2017-07-22,32756625,Diana,"Darling, cozy tiny house.  Awesome location for walk to both downtown and coast."
4162387,175000925,2017-07-27,114480789,Sarah,"The house is nice and authentic. Joy was very communicative and friendly. It is close to the main attraction of Monterey, but a car is needed because the house is on top of a hill and the main streest are near the ocean."
4162387,175794474,2017-07-29,84280290,Marcus,"Lovely charming authentic house, good location. We truly enjoyed it!"
4162387,176377462,2017-07-30,31284955,Rango,Overall the place is very charming.
4162387,179488332,2017-08-07,4162411,Bettye Jo,"Great historic house, delightful quiet neighborhood, feels private and yet a block away from the laid back Pacific Grove restaurants, coffee shops, beach, farmers market and local art and antique shops.  Joy was a great host - giving lots of space to allow us to make the place our own while at the same time Informing us of alll the local happenings.   We extended our stay a couple of days at the end of our week because it was so easy and relaxing.   Expect basic comforts with internet and no TV, and don't be afraid to ask for something if it's missing!  Joy's a joy to rent from.   We would come back."
4162387,183547983,2017-08-17,6644177,Niki,Very cute little house! Easy walk to shops and restaurants! Would definitely recommend. :)

4162387,185864952,2017-08-22,65409230,Brian,Very cute and comfortable house in a fabulous location in Pacific Grove. Joy made check in and check out a breeze. We plan to return next time we're visiting the Monterey Peninsula.
4162387,188561002,2017-08-29,43614619,Barry,"The location was perfect for us.  We could walk anywhere easily.  Joy was very accommodating and helpful.  We had a wonderful visit to Pacific Grove, one of our favorite towns."
4162387,190240057,2017-09-03,38809755,Sofia,We had a very nice stay and Joy was a great host!
4162387,191254254,2017-09-06,56703,Lana,"Cute little house in a wonderful location. The property is historic and characterful but does feel a little tired & run down. Aside from that we loved our stay here. So close to good eateries, beautiful coast line and the aquarium."
4162387,192487216,2017-09-10,10536293,Anita,"A wonderful stay, close to downtown.  Joy is a great host and very helpful."

Host is very easy to work with, gave good suggestions for places to eat, all of which we enjoyed. Only there one night but had very nice time."
4162387,193740122,2017-09-14,136583702,Jessica,"This blue cottage was so perfect for our stay in Pacific Grove! We could easily walk to downtown area for all the amazing shops and stores, as well as a short drive to Carmel and Monterrey. Amazing little place in a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for an ""at home"" feel!"
4162387,195260792,2017-09-18,118767624,Ann,"This little cottage is as charming as described and pictured.  It is in a great location; very short walking distance to town.  It's a fairly short walk to the shoreline as well.  The neighborhood is extremely quiet and lovely. 
   The kitchen if fully equipped, linens and basic household needs are plentiful.   
   Previous reviews have warned that the shower is very small; we found this only mildly annoying/amusing - but we are not large people. 
  If you can appreciate small historical homes in a wonderful neighborhood, it will be a good fit.  If you are looking for modern luxury with big screen TV, modern large bathroom,  etc., keep looking.   
  Joy is a wonderful attentive host; and nearby if any assistance needed. We look forward to returning."
4162387,195515654,2017-09-19,150629529,Garvin,Very nice little home near restaurants and shops. Would definitely stay here again if I am in the area.
4162387,195785146,2017-09-20,13215904,Lamont,"This is a lovely quaint property located a short walk to the coast/bay. Two friends and I stayed here for one night only and it was a perfect pit stop as we journeyed to Yosemite. Joy is also great and very responsive too, so we felt comfortable that we would get back to us when we message her."
4162387,196039964,2017-09-21,19106615,Carolann,Joy's home was beautiful and full of her creativity and charm. Really enjoyed the ease of staying at this property and the privacy it offered. Would certainly return again.
4162387,196324148,2017-09-22,31799033,Jenny,"Fantastic location close to bakery for breakfast, high street and walking distance to beach down charming streets. Beautifully decorated with fabric paintings. Comfortable space"
4162387,197002414,2017-09-24,10303048,Anne-Claire,"Very easy check-in and timely communication from Joy. Old, cozy house with basic amenities. Great alternative to some of the pricy hotels in the area."
4162387,197754067,2017-09-26,32612760,Kevin,Joy's home ranks as one of the best I've ever stayed at with AirBnB. It is charming and unique and perfectly situated in Pacific Grove. I can not recommend it enough!
4162387,198005074,2017-09-27,86405137,Tian,My experience there was great. I really like the notes joy left on the table in which everything you need to know about the house is described in detail.
4162387,198525335,2017-09-29,69835818,Kevin,The little blue house was the perfect size for my wife and I. We were looking for somewhere to stay in a nice beach town atmosphere along route 1 and we discovered Pacific Grove and ultimately the little blue house. the owner (Joy) was very friendly and communicated the perfect amount. She was local to the house so we knew if anything needed to be taken care of she would be all over it. We would definitely stay again and would recommend it to any couple or couple +1.
4162387,198856461,2017-09-30,81979961,Laura,"What a JOY this home was.  The first thing I said when I walked in was ""I could live here"".  The decorations and attention to detail were unmatched.  We stayed here after a day exploring Big Sur, the drive was quick (and beautiful, almost wish it was longer...).  We had the pleasure of meeting Joy as she was working on the home next door.  What an awesome lady and an awesome stay!"
4162387,200823899,2017-10-06,31520309,Bart,My girlfriend and I stayed at the Little Blue House for two nights and we had a great stay. The house is very cute and perfect for two people. It was clean and had everything we needed. The location is perfect; near Moterey and the 17-mile drive and in walking distance of the coastline and shops and restaurants. Joy was very kind and communicative. Would definitely recommend the Little Blue House.
4162387,201717267,2017-10-08,42239197,Kelly,Great communication with a gracious hostess. Cute house!
4162387,202329299,2017-10-10,42239197,Kelly,Nice location!
4162387,202528889,2017-10-11,151526648,Allen,Close to 17 mile drive. Neat little town with a couple of good breakfast spots. Parking not ideal.
4162387,203000016,2017-10-13,154070697,Derek,A cozy little house half a block from the middle of Lighthouse.  Perfect location in Pacific Grove.  Creatively decorated.  Big shrub out front provides good privacy and quiet.  And a sunny back yard patio.  Great place for one or two visitors.
4162387,203873851,2017-10-15,144026686,Kate,"The home is adorable and central to a lot of wonderful restaurants! It is small and more of a ""couple's retreat"" type place, not suitable for three."
4162387,204545973,2017-10-18,78165956,Lindsay,"Joy's place is a very cute little place in a great area of Monterey! The neighborhood is very peaceful yet still close enough to walk to shops and restaurants, as well as the coast. Joy made check in and check out very easy for us and was always available if we needed anything. Her place was a perfect spot for two and was very clean and full of her amazing artwork on the walls. Thanks so much for having us, Joy! Hope to be back again soon!"
4162387,205285125,2017-10-21,138949629,Chelsea,"Joy is super helpful and the house is so cute! Not too far from Carmel or Monterey, about 10-15 minute Uber!"
4162387,206107840,2017-10-23,49738876,Lindsay,"Joy's house is cute and cozy. The kitchen and living area is really nice, it is a great place to relax. Check in was a breeze, and there were lots of great suggestions for places to eat. It is pretty much within walking distance of all the Pacific Grove/Monterey highlights. Be aware, the house is old, the shower is tiny, and (unless we missed where they were kept) you might need to bring extra blankets of your own if you are visiting in the colder months. Or just ask Joy! We kept to ourselves, but she makes herself available if you need anything. I thought that was very nice. If you are looking for fancy and new, this isn't that kind of place. But if you are looking for a place to rest during a weekend getaway for two, it has everything you need."
4162387,207753833,2017-10-29,41478075,Richard,Awesome place!
4162387,208955073,2017-11-03,15225384,Joe,Fantastic location! Very easy check in and check out. Pacific grove is great.
4162387,209990553,2017-11-06,8400033,Caroline,"Beautiful little house perfectly situated in Pacific Grove. Easy walk to shops, restaurants, and the path by the ocean. We’ll be back. Thank you for having us!"
4162387,212624295,2017-11-18,14944522,Mary,"Great location, short walk to downtown Pacific Grove and just a bit farther to the beach. (which is amazing!) Joy provided some great tips on what to see and do in the area.  Her communication was just right for us; plenty of information and an easy check-in/check-out process.

One thing to note - if you use a hair dryer or other electric appliance in the bathroom, be prepared to plug it into the bedroom outlet.  There are no outlets in the bathroom itself.  There is an extension cord provided, however."
4162387,213105708,2017-11-19,21232717,Stephan,Small cozy house in a perfect location. Parking was also very easy to find. Passionfish (recommendation from Joy) is within walking distance and is an excellent place for dinner.
4162387,213730795,2017-11-22,18071320,Kelly,Joy’s space was absolutely perfect for my birthday trip. The house is adorable and Joy offered information about the history of the house in her homemade guide as well as tips for local spots to enjoy. She had many thoughtful touches around the house and it was the perfect location for walking around the area. The art in the home is made by Joy and it is absolutely beautiful. We really didn’t want to leave! Thank you Joy for hosting us!
4162387,214821668,2017-11-26,107700888,Michael,Beautiful house in an absolutely ideal location.
4162387,215590659,2017-11-30,138937091,Robert,This is a very charming cottage. The heating system kept the cottage cozy on a cool late November evening and the neighborhood is a delight. Joy is the most gracious of hosts. She went out of her way to ensure a fantastic stay.
4162387,217533651,2017-12-09,15943351,Benjamin,"This small historic home was the perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I, close to wonderful restaurants and scenic beaches. Only wish we could have stayed longer."
4162387,217999098,2017-12-10,4869110,Jiaqi,Very cute house for a private getaway!
4162387,219524132,2017-12-17,7578553,Ali,cute and quiet while still being super close to restaurants etc. We really enjoyed our stay!
4162387,222086466,2017-12-28,48718725,Jesse,Joy's place was perfectly located. We also enjoyed the art and stained glass windows.

4162387,223131664,2017-12-31,13530815,Kelly,Cozy little home in an ideal location just a tiny walk to downtown Pacific Grove. Perfect for walking/biking around town!
4162387,224328894,2018-01-02,25872562,Brianna,"Very cute and cozy, close to the beach and small town! "
4162387,225500194,2018-01-06,105981126,Shana,This historic house was close to Pacific Grove and in walking distance of the Aquarium. Joy is a wonderful host! We had a great stay!
4162387,229031783,2018-01-21,41402360,James,What a great place to stay! Walking distance from great food and the aquarium!
4162387,231965070,2018-02-03,48531432,Nicholas,Loved the old town beach vibe.
4162387,232433639,2018-02-04,65806579,Meowanie,Really small shower. Neighborhood is adorable and quiet and location can’t be beat. Would def stay again.
4162387,233712753,2018-02-10,154462275,Maggie,"Really cute house, snuggled inbetween other historical homes. Very calm area and only a few steps away from the shops and the beach"
4162387,234169807,2018-02-11,68758349,Brendan,My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at the Little Blue House. The house was only a block or two away from local shops and restaurants. I’d will book again if I vacation in the Monterey area.
4162387,235726517,2018-02-17,53889621,Maddie,The little blue house is adorable and perfectly located. It's away from the busy vibes of Monterey but just a quick walk away from the water. The space gets really chilly at night so I'd definitely recommend using the space heater!
4162387,236902180,2018-02-20,28184829,George,"Wonderful location, very much enjoyed all of the nearby hiking and beaches. Quiet neighborhood."
4162387,237635615,2018-02-23,10935598,Admas,"Joy's place was a lovely quaint spot for a quick trip to Monterrey. It's in a great location where you can walk to the grocery store, juice or coffee bar, antique shops, etc. It's also a short driving distance to any of the famous landmarks. Joy was really helpful and thoughtful - she offered to add a portable crib for my toddler. Check-in and check-out was super easy. I would stay at Joy's again!!"
4162387,238415912,2018-02-25,1318777,Patty,"House is very centrally located in Pacific Grove, cute place, very small but perfectly adequate. Easy check-in, easy out, too."
4162387,240453323,2018-03-04,49923482,Kathy,such an adorable place in the perfect location!
4162387,241122551,2018-03-07,27797078,Dan,Had to request refund. We stayed the night only after arriving back at gone 6pm which was the kids bedtime. Clearly house not that clean. Hair throughout bathroom which belonged to someone else. Had ants crawling over kitchen following morning. Maybe next time a thorough cleaning process should happen prior to booking or people arriving. Needs some modernisation aswell. Beautiful little home though. Pacific grove is a lovely town.
4162387,241337005,2018-03-08,5523050,Peter,"Eclectic cute little house with warm, personal touches at a great location."
4162387,242706037,2018-03-12,17105422,Addison,Very cute cottage. Perfect for the two of us during our short stay in pacific grove. You can’t beat the location - so close to town and in a safe neighborhood. It was also easy to find parking right outside.
4162387,244868000,2018-03-19,76787040,Milena,"We had a great stay at the little blue house. Even though we never met Joy in person, she was very helpful and always responded quickly."
4162387,248114822,2018-03-30,70062851,Leigh,"Joy was a great host- smart, funny and engaging. Everything was just as advertised. The bedroom and bathroom were cozy and comfortable. We loved the funky/artistic vibe and the unbelievably quiet street. The house was a short walk to town with coffee shops, good restaurants and stores. Lover’s Point on the beach was just steps away from the main drag. We loved Joy’s little blue house and Pacific Grove."
4162387,249193574,2018-04-01,15597060,Rob,"Charming house in great location, but disappointed by poor cleaning."
4162387,251909955,2018-04-08,67913763,Anne-Marie,"Perfect location! We really enjoyed walking everywhere-- restaurants, beaches, hikes, etc."
4162387,252244016,2018-04-09,180730639,Patsy,"This place is adorable and close walk to the town and shops.  It's a little expensive with tax and fees added on for one night.  There is no TV but a theatre close by.  The back courtyard is overgrown and patio set is unusable but has a lot potential and needs some tlc. Make sure to turn on the space heater as it gets cold at night.  The neighborhood is adorable and we walked everywhere.  So much to do here, lighthouse, restaurants, shops, aquarium, amazing views of shoreline and you can watch sealions bask in the beach. Bring your binoculars!  Wish we did."
4162387,255202158,2018-04-19,172902528,Adam,Quaint and comfy house. Short walk to restaurants and shops nearby. Great place!
4291804,27574354,2015-03-08,25429398,Phillip,Great stay
4291804,27715982,2015-03-10,25429398,Phillip,"The house was better than we could have imagined. We had a 30th birthday for my girlfriend that she will never forget. The location is great and you can see the water in the bay from the back porch.

We had a small issue while at the unit, but it was handled professionally and quickly by the host. Thank you for the stay, I look forward to another visit in the future."
4291804,27983723,2015-03-15,29006482,梦媛,"We had a wonderful time there, the house is clean and beautiful. "

4291804,29247814,2015-04-05,161708,Royston,"We got a little confused when we arrived because the property was split into two areas. We walked up from the main road and found a group of people in the house. We thought we were double booked! 

Fortunately, upon reading the instructions a lot closely, we figured we should head around the house & found another entrance from the back, a harry potter-esque moment for us.

Other than this oversight on our part, the house was perfect. Comfy and roomy as the photo suggests. Definitely stay here if you happen to be in Monterey."
4291804,29446143,2015-04-07,376319,Christine,Fabulous place.  Very nice clean and comfortable.  Walking distance to the aquarium. Guita was great with my last minute questions.  Place as described.  
4291804,30161345,2015-04-18,4449475,Helen,"This was a beautiful home in a convenient, quiet neighborhood location in Monterey. I rented Guita's place out for 3 nights for guests for the weekend that I got married and it was just right for them: great decor, 3 bedrooms with a variety of bed sizes (single and larger beds) and equipped with what my guests needed. My guests enjoyed their stay and Guita was a pleasure to book with and responsive!"
4291804,31270328,2015-05-03,19932050,Yang,The house is so nice and can easily fit 6-8 people. The location is also great. 5 minutes by driving to the sea. The host is also so nice and patience. I would definitely rent the house if I will go there again.
4291804,33089136,2015-05-25,29580531,Nafisah,Guita was amazing and answered all of our questions long before we arrived. Nothing was left to chance and her home is awesome!!
4291804,33890138,2015-06-01,31929921,Stacy,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4291804,35643258,2015-06-21,29636168,Cari,"Though I did not actually meet Guita, she was very helpful and flexible with us throughout our entire stay. She was easy to reach when needed, and happy to answer my many questions! 

The home itself is absolutely beautiful. The pictures do not even come close to doing this place justice! The decor is updated and clean with a hint of rustic charm. I particularly liked the space rugs and light fixtures, as well as the brightly painted accent walls and artwork. Our group of 6 consisted of two couples and two additional friends, all in town for a wedding in Carmel. Guita's home easily and comfortably accommodated our needs.

The location is excellent - walking distance to the aquarium and shops, and a quick drive to Carmel and Pebble Beach. I would absolutely recommend this home to anybody looking to stay in Monterey!!"
4291804,36505596,2015-06-29,27900419,Jesse,"Everything was great! The directions were easy, the house was clean and ready. The location to restaurants and Cannery Row is fantastic. The host is really quick to respond to emails and texts, which I appreciated. The kitchen has all the utensils and appliances you'd need. Great little backyard patio area, with a lower level too. 

Just a couple tips: bring your own towels if there are lots of you, and maybe some extra pillows and bedding. There isn't a ton of closet space, so you may want to ask the host. 

Overall, we had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again.

"
4291804,36865934,2015-07-02,31785053,Jimin,The accommodation is vey nice. We have a good sleep over there. Guita is so kind. We are happy to with Guita's house again.  
4291804,37951786,2015-07-12,27014127,Beatrice,"My family and in-laws loved staying at this home.  The decor was beautiful, rooms spacious, and beds extremely comfortable (even the person who had to sleep on the pull-out couch mentioned how comfortable it was).  My toddler son enjoyed playing on the outdoor deck and backyard.
The location is ideal as it's easy access to cannery row and the aquarium (walking distance) and pacific grove's downtown (a little longer walk).  There's a supermarket, liquor store, 7-11, and gas station just down the street.  
The house is located uphill from the aquarium which was a little hard on the first day.  However, on the second day I barely noticed the incline.
There was a slight mix-up as another family had arrived before us (mistakenly thought they had reserved the same place for the same wknd) but Guita dealt with it and we were able to check-in on time.  

I would definitely stay here again and/or recommend it to friends."

4291804,40235976,2015-07-29,16684970,Lisa,We had a wonderful stay at Guita's place. It is as charming as it appeared in the photos. It was perfect for my husband and two children and a mere 10 minute walk to the Aquarium. 
4291804,40730301,2015-08-02,2242249,Jane,The house was awesome! A mix of modern and old wooden and vintage decoration. Beds were very comfortable. Large kitchen and big dinning table for a group. We booked the adjoining house and it was perfect for us. Very close to cannery row. Thanks!
4291804,45989269,2015-09-07,37681453,Jamie,The house was amazing and accommodated my family for our parents anniversary. The home is within walking distance of the places we planned on checking out. We didn't have to deal with driving and finding parking as we walked to most all locations. The house is lovely!

4291804,53319851,2015-11-08,37186558,Joe,Guita made us feel very welcome.The place was just as she described it.
4291804,57287764,2015-12-24,6677913,Ken,"The home is exactly as described. Plenty of towels and toiletries for our group of 5 adults and 3 small kids. Didn't see much outside because of rain, but inside is nice. One major problem (to me) is the owner took one of the assigned parking spots. In my opinion, when I rent something possession is now mine, not the owners, for the duration. The owners simply repossessed one parking spot. So we had to walk in the cold rain to our car parked further away. The owners had nothing to say about their repossession of parking. If the street parking is so wonderfully convenient, the owners should use it, not take parking from me. "
4291804,59974019,2016-01-17,1161376,Kendall,"We had a wonderful stay here and Guita could not have been a more gracious host!  Upon arrival, we were greeted with a vase full of fresh flowers!  The house was clean, bright, and comfortable and we really enjoyed being able to walk to the Aquarium and the water.  Gotta say that we also loved the massage chair!

Above all this though was how thoughtful and flexible Guita was in accommodating us and our new baby.  Guita was able to provide us a nice crib which saved us a lot of hassle.  Come time to checkout, Guita was kind enough to allow us to stay a little later which was really helpful in getting our baby ready for the drive back to San Francisco.

I would absolutely recommend Guita and her home to anyone looking for a fantastic Monterey holiday."
4291804,60522428,2016-01-24,54798634,Eve,Our stay was lovely. The house was clean and within walking distance to shops and the aquarium. Guita and Rick were easy to get in touch with. They responded immediately when we had difficulty getting into the Internet. We would gladly stay there again. Thanks Guita and Rick!
4291804,62520264,2016-02-15,9125508,Melinda,"We had a wonderful stay in Guita's house!  It was exactly as pictured and very comfortable for our group of five.  We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood on foot, it was a very easy walk down the hill to Cannery Row but still off the beaten path and very quiet."
4291804,66170638,2016-03-20,26597346,Amy,We enjoyed our stay in this charming house. The location is perfect. We are able to walk to and from the aquarium and several playgrounds. The beds were comfortable and the little garden was a nice place to relax.
4291804,66780494,2016-03-24,59817423,Sarah,Guita's house was wonderful. We had a perfect stay there and can't wait to go back. It was close to the Aquarium and other fun things. House was exactly as she describes. I have no complaints at all. We loved Guita's house!
4291804,70491742,2016-04-18,26630702,Marla,"Guita was great, she did a great job!"
4291804,72457406,2016-05-02,13964558,Stephanie,"Great experience!  With Guita's permission, I reserved this home for my father, his wife and my aunts for a weekend family reunion in PG.  My cousins and I stayed nearby.  As the description says, it is an easy walk to the Aquarium and Cannery Row as well as along the water front in PG which made it a great location to meet up and head to our various activities.  The home is well equipped, well furnished and the bedrooms are large and comfortable.  The living and dining room area easily accommodates the 6-8 people that the home holds and would make a great and comfy ""home base"" for any family vacationing in the area.  Guita was very welcoming and very responsive to all my questions.  Thank you!"
4291804,73306258,2016-05-08,13396203,Brian,The house is even more beautiful and comfortable than the pictures show!  Guita was communicative and made sure that my group was comfortable.  The area is very charming and peaceful.  The locals are extremely polite and friendly.  My group spent two nights here and drove out to Big Sur during the day.  It was a convenient location for our trip.  Highly recommend this great host and great home!
4291804,75708243,2016-05-22,100540,Paddy,"Our family of 7 had a great reunion in Monterey, thanks in part to Guita's wonderful house with its unique decor. It's a quiet spot, nestled in easy walking distance to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Since we had a nineteen-month-old with us, it was great to have a close spot for a much-needed mid-day nap. There was plenty of room, and the beds had lovely linens. An available barbecue grill made dinner at home an easy feat. Guita also made certain there was a crib set up when we arrived. Parking, even with three cars, was not a problem, since there's no time limit for parking on side streets. Can't think of any negatives about this wonderful home, except, perhaps, that because of some steps that are clearly shown in the photos (oops, there are steps behind the sunflowers in the main photo), it would be difficult for anyone who is disabled to get around. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend the spot. Thank you, Guita and Rich.  "
4291804,76917799,2016-05-29,58271362,Katie,This was a beautiful home and my guests and I had a great time staying here!
4291804,80365290,2016-06-17,5066498,Ron,Just a short walk down the hill to the Aquarium and all the restaurants and fun things to do! The house was perfect for my family of four plus my mother. Would highly recommend to a group visiting Monterey.
4291804,82226246,2016-06-26,9797344,Jocelyn,"Guita's home was perfect for our family get-a-way.  There was plenty of space for the kids to move about and a very cute back patio.  Location is perfect, with an easy (downhill) walk to the Aquarium, and other fun sites and restaurants.  I highly recommend this home.  "
4291804,82898589,2016-06-30,70821408,Ray,"Great home with wonderful hosts. The home was spacious and very clean. The beds are very comfortable, and the home is decorated expertly. Communication was excellent with the hosts, and they made you feel welcomed. The location is perfect, close to Cannery Row and the Wharf. The streets in front and back are 2 way, this makes leaving and returning very convenient! Kitchen is highly functional and the bathrooms are nice. I would highly recommend staying here!"
4291804,84118224,2016-07-05,65935775,Joanie,Guita's home is perfect if you are staying in the Monterey Bay Area. It is beautifully decorated with all the amenities you could ask for. Would definitely stay here again! 
4291804,84470197,2016-07-07,3252147,Tejal,"Great place, great location! Everything was really simple, from the communication for checking in and to checking out. Very easy!  Guita and Rick were awesome.  The location is wonderful because its walking distance to Cannery Row and a short drive to Downtown Monterey,  Very clean and the pictures are spot on!"
4291804,84922151,2016-07-09,77617705,Chris,"Everything was mostly as expected and pretty seemless experience with no real complaints other than parking. We were told there was space for two vehicles. However, upon arriving there only appeared to be space for one small to midsized vehicle to park. Fortunately, we had decided to only bring one. However, the parking was a little cramped and you had to let people on one side of car out before parking. Wasn't a big deal for us but might be important for someone with larger suv."
4291804,87606649,2016-07-21,5762051,Kent,"We enjoyed our stay a great deal.  The home was perfect for our group of six, 4 adults and two teens.  We were able to walk to Cannery Row to restaurants and shopping, although the walk back is a little up hill.  We would recommend the rental, yes."
4291804,90992338,2016-08-03,39506,Toni,We had an amazing time.  The house was exactly as described! Thanks again!!!
4291804,93370881,2016-08-12,59651959,Deborah,Only thing I didn't like is that there was no provision for hanging clothes/closet space in 2 main bedrooms.  Location is great for Aquarium and walking to Cannery Row etc.  House was stocked with all the basics we needed.

Parking is inconvenient as the driveway is narrow and not a lot of space. Bring laptop to stream NBA or other tv channels as there was limited cable service. Not a lot of big towels for 10 people. Overall was great and would recommend to a friend. "

4291804,181455753,2017-08-12,143034520,Kristen,The house looks bigger in person than in the photos. Really nice private outdoor space to relax. Each room is on a slightly different level so there are several steps inside. Definitely an easy walk to the aquarium. The walk home was hard while pushing 3 kids uphill but gave us a good workout. Parking was tricky with our F150 because the spots are more for smaller cars. Nice place to stay close to cannery row.
4291804,182481458,2017-08-14,126689530,Alex,"Very close to shops and restaurants. (Tricycle pizza was our favorite.)The house was comfortable for my family of 6 adults, a child, and a baby."
4291804,190748161,2017-09-04,130361757,Karen,"Guita's home is lovely, quiet, spacious, and conveniently located. It was very clean. Check-in was easy, with her partner meeting us when we arrived, despite traffic making us late. Three nice bedrooms. I wouldn't recommend staying there with elderly people or toddlers because there's too many hard-to-see steps going from room-to-room. Other than that, it's great!!"
4291804,195295855,2017-09-18,131739099,臧,"Guita的房子干净又温馨,精心的装饰能看出主人很好的品味,厨房用品以及浴室用品都很齐全,位置也很好,非常推荐。"
4291804,220986008,2017-12-24,110400045,Jeff,"A really cute little cottage that is actually quite spacious. It’s well appointed, very comfortable, and a short walk to the aquarium and Cannery Row. Highly recommend."
4436534,24271236,2014-12-24,23787095,Patrick,"The listing as Quiet Ocean view Cottage was a good four word description but hardly covers just how wonderful and charming and relaxing this place is. Jeanne was an exceptional host and provided all of the relevant communication and information needed and has provided an exceptional home to stay in. The location, just a few hundred feet from the ocean and next to a lovely park that allowed unfettered views the ocean, was ideal for us. 
The house had great charm, right down to the Thomas Kinkade paintings. It has a fabulous master bedroom upstairs with adjustable power beds and a huge bay window and bathroom with a huge walk in shower. Two more ample bedrooms downstairs and bathroom with an oversize soak tub. A very comfortable living room, large well quipped kitchen and dining room, with wood and tile floors throughout. There is a private area in the yard for grilling and eating and a beautiful patio garden with fountains and plants and perfect for relaxing. 
So much attention has been placed on detail and creating a house that is at the highest level of quality and styling.
We could not have found a more perfect place and location for us, far enough away from the busy areas yet so close to the wonderful downtown shops and restaurants as well as Monterrey and Carmel areas. Such beautiful ocean beach views as well as views of the migrating whales. 
We would give this place our absolute highest rating and recommendation to our friends and family and anyone wishing a genuinely peaceful and relaxing central coast experience."
4436534,24480353,2014-12-29,22885888,Kirk,"Wow, I mean WOW.  Your search is done, seriously don't waste your time just book this place, the home and owners are very accomodating and you'll be vacationing like a king.  The master bed and bath are beautiful.  Shower is amazing and great views from every window in the house.  Words can't describe this house and the photos don't do it justice.  As I said your search is over just book this place now!!!"
4436534,26602555,2015-02-16,12710598,Heidi,"Beautiful and comfortable cottage, recently renovated, one house away from oceanfront. Great views and very easy to head down 17 Mile Drive or enjoy the wonderful town of Pacific Grove. Cute little sandy beach down the street and fully stocked kitchen. The clawfoot tub is great for the kiddos but all the adults will want to share the upstairs shower. It was easy to be there with two families, each with one infant. We had a fantastic stay and would definitely come back. The only note is there that there is minimal storage for clothes which is no problem for a weekend but might be tough for a longer stay. "
4436534,32896350,2015-05-23,14815413,Ron,"We have just spent 5 nights in Pacific Grove and enjoyed every
moment.  The house was very comfortable and the location
perfect.  We slept in the upstairs bedroom which had a great
view of the coast.  The kitchen was well appointed and the
outside areas pleasant.  The plants were all in bloom and we
loved seeing the humming birds feeding."
4436534,33918690,2015-06-02,3001860,Megan,"Wow, this place was incredible. The views, the home - I couldn't imagine a better place to stay. I was so impressed I have already started planning our next trip to this home! Thank you so much Jeanne for sharing your lovely home. Words can't describe the beauty of it and the surroundings. Will for sure stay here again and highly recommend others to check it out as well!"
4436534,96371641,2016-08-22,83126794,Thomas,Just as described. Great place in a nice area. Would certainly recommend this place.
4436534,147240551,2017-04-25,23833187,Kacie,"This rental was in such a great location. Perfect walking distance to town, great views and very comfortable accommodations. Jeanne was very helpful and responsive. It was a great trip!"
4697656,83692902,2016-07-04,80300500,Ruben,"Stacey was an outstanding host. She was very helpful and recommended some wonderful restaurants and locations to visit. Her home was absolutely stunning and the accommodations/ amenities she provided were incredible. My favorite part was waking up to the view of the beautiful redwood tree right outside the window. Overall, we had an amazing experience and will definitely be back the next time we travel through this area."
4697656,85135490,2016-07-10,46739568,Eric,"My stay with Stacey was great. The room is private, clean and comfortable. Stacey goes out of her way to provide you with everything you could possibly need during your stay including coffee, snacks and some treats from the local bakery, among other things. Parking in the driveway is easy and the house feels like home. I used Stacey's home for a 3 day golf trip and it was a great place to rest after some long days. I would highly recommend Stacey's place. Stacey herself is very open, nice and communicates great. "
4697656,86733242,2016-07-17,51152684,Ian,Stacy was an awesome host. we really appreciated all her work and she went above and beyond in every way.
4697656,87687794,2016-07-21,32937381,Sally,"I visited Pacific Grove to attend the birthday party/family reunion of a close family friend who lives near Stacey. I only needed a place to sleep at night, as I spent virtually all of my visit with my friends, but I ended up having a delightful time staying at Stacey's house.  My room was light, airy and comfortable and the neighborhood is a charming array of small, well-kept former seaside cottages close to the water, and to Pacific Grove's downtown.
Stacey was a gracious host and made me feel welcome from the start; I particularly enjoyed learning about her life in Pacific Grove.  When I visit Pacific Grove in the future, I will definitely stay at Stacey's house!"
4697656,90454732,2016-08-01,81427272,Dennis,Our stay with Stacey was fantastic! The bed was super comfy and we felt cared for in every way. We made a life friend and we know we will return. Darling little dogs a bonus!
4697656,91729948,2016-08-06,35519854,Susan,"Stacey was a lovely host.  Her house truly is ""Peaceful in Pacific Grove"". The private access was easy, the bed was super comfy and the room is spacious and quiet.  Stacey provided wonderful baked goods and fresh fruit and was most welcoming.  The location was so convenient to many Monterey sites. We loved our stay."
4697656,93787085,2016-08-14,4837280,Wyncia,"Thanks,  Stacey,  for you wrlcome.  Lovely place with spacious room. "
4697656,95115843,2016-08-18,19775162,Anca,"We spent 2 nights at Stacey's and as soon as we arrived we wished we could have stayed more....The room is cozy and spotless clean, the bed is comfy and the down comforter was a ""life saver"" in the chili nights. Everything is in walking distance, and Lover's Point beach and park are just a short walk away. The gate to the 17 mile drive (to Carmel) is also nearby. Look for dolphins when you are at the beach.
Stacey communicated with us promptly and clearly and surprised us at breakfast with treats from the local bakery (don't miss visiting Pavel's in person!). Thank you Stacey for sharing your beautiful home with us! We are already planning next year's vacation and we plan to stay at least 3-4 days - with you! :)

Anca and George"
4697656,96451897,2016-08-22,3816228,Nadav,"Highly recommended! I stayed here for a few nights to attend Monterey Car Week. Perfectly placed to explore Pacific Grove, Monterey, Carmel and the rest of the peninsula.

The house is beautiful and warm, situated in a peaceful cul-de-sac. The room was charming and inviting - quiet, neat and perfectly clean, with extra blankets, water, coffee, tea and treats all available. Private entrance too.

Stacy was charming, attentive, welcoming and generous. The check-in process was clear and easy. Stacy did everything possible to make me feel at home, including providing an endless supply of cookies, biscotti and good coffee!

Note that there are dogs on the premises and that the bathroom (also spotless) requires a walk across the common areas of the house."
4697656,96909229,2016-08-25,14021694,Ralph,Stacey was a friendly and welcoming host.  The room is beautifully appointed.  I would highly recommend staying at her place.

4697656,99371113,2016-09-04,36746224,Barbara,"My stay at Stacey's was fantastic! She is warm, caring, outgoing and ever-so helpful. I enjoyed the peace and quiet of her cheerful home. She made sure I had everything I needed. I could not have asked for a happier setting for my 9-night stay!"
4697656,101014713,2016-09-11,35243506,Sean,"Stacey is an all-around great hostess. She gave us very clear instructions to find her home and left us welcome treats and area recommendations when we arrived. The room is exactly as pictured- peaceful, private, clean, and very comfortable (best pillows EVER). Its location is a great place to stay when visiting Pacific Grove or Monterey. Her two dogs are gems. "
4697656,102415730,2016-09-18,11079441,Alison,Stacey made us feel as if her home was our home. She is very friendly and showed such an interest in us and our travels. The 'studio' was so comfy and Stacey had thought of absolutely everything to help make it a memorable stay. She is a very busy lady so we were left to our own devices but that isn't a criticism at all because we felt that we were really at home and yet could contact Stacey about absolutely anything and knew it would be sorted (there wasn't anything but we knew if there had been all would have been well!)
4697656,102908556,2016-09-19,48012632,Kat,"Stacey, was just the best host and Pacific Grove was an adorable town, so it was a perfect little get away. Stacey's home is in a perfect spot, which made it easy to get around town. She made our stay so comfortable and her pups were just the sweetest. We would definitely stay with Stacey again, hopefully we will make a trip back again...soon! Thanks again for everything! "
4697656,104363889,2016-09-26,61182961,Shannon,Stacey is an amazing host as she made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Her home was as described and the room we stayed in was beautiful. Stacey is very hospitable and accommodating. We had our privacy with our own parking spot in the driveway and a private entrance into the home. Every morning she had fresh goodies from the Local Bakery waiting for us. The neighborhood was adorable and in such a great location as we could walk to grab a bite to eat or grab a cup of coffee. She gave us some great suggestions on where to eat and sites to see. We would definitely recommend staying here and would love to come back again.
4697656,105717336,2016-10-02,94297873,Hank,"Stacey's house is exactly what my wife and I were looking for.  Quiet, nestled in, very clean and comfortable.  Stacey was very accommodating, left us fresh baked goods, prepared coffee, suggested great hiking trails and an extremely pleasant host.  Great communication.  We will definitely return and absolutely recommend Stacey and her beautiful home.    THANK YOU!!!!"
4697656,107233624,2016-10-09,96040686,Adrianne,Stacey was a warm and gracious host. Her home is lovely!  Truly felt like a B&B.
4697656,108852422,2016-10-17,72591520,Sheryl,"Stacey was very friendly and hospitable - she made us feel very much at home.  Directions and check-in was easy.  The location was perfect for visiting the Monterey/Carmel/Pacific Grove area and the space was clean and comfortable w/ lots of storage.  The only drawback was that the bath, while private, was not ""attached"" to the bedroom - which was a little inconvenient, but manageable.  The cookies and biscotti were a delicious treat and a ""sweet"" touch.  Thank you for helping to make our trip a success!"
4697656,109974617,2016-10-23,8878163,Kathryn,"Stacey is one of the nicest humans you will ever meet and her place is charming and impeccably clean. She was extremely helpful and friendly while being very respectful of our space. Her beautiful home is a short walk from downtown Pacific Grove and some wonderful beach walks. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend her room to anyone looking. 

Thank you Stacey! "
4697656,110821162,2016-10-28,42434747,Jenna,"I was in Pacific Grove for a conference for 2 days and had a fantastic experience at Stacey's. The space was very spacious, clean, comfortable, and adorable. Stacey provided all the amenities needed - from a space heater, to a coffee maker, to area maps, to a fully stocked bathroom, to freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. The location was in perfect proximity to the conference venue (Asilomar) and I had time to explore Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel - all just a short drive away. Stacey is very sweet and helpful and made me feel right at home. I highly recommend this space and hope to visit again. "
4697656,110992138,2016-10-29,28530285,Brent,The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4697656,111786353,2016-11-01,6967590,Michael,"Stacey welcomed us warmly into her inviting home and made us feel right at home. Though she leads a very busy life, she took time to visit and make sure our needs were met. The room was a comfortable size, but perhaps difficult to represent with a photo. I would say it was better than the photo represented. The neighborhood was quiet and pleasant. It felt very safe and secure."
4697656,115321220,2016-11-23,89554644,Amanda,"Stacey's house is within walking distance to a lot of attractions. The whole time my friend and I were there we didn't have to drive once! 
When we arrived Stacey greeted us and we got to meet her two adorable little dogs. She's very easy to talk to yet gave us the privacy we wanted. The room itself is super comfy, literally the softest, warmest bed I've ever slept in. If I'm ever traveling in the area I would definitely stay here again.  "
4697656,133168425,2017-02-20,5508753,Travis,Stacey and her dogs were extremely friendly and made us feel at home from the minute we got there. The room was perfect and exactly like the pictures. She even had a space heater for if it got a little cold at night. Her recommendations were absolutely amazing and made our trip very memorable. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
4697656,138678843,2017-03-20,832753,Joal,"Our destination, The Aquarium, was just a few minutes drive from Stacey's place. Many great choices for dining are within walking distance. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe.  
Stacey made every effort to give us all the support we would need and provide privacy too as she shared her home with us. Carmel and Point Lobos were minutes away and very enjoyable as well. We would book with Stacey again if we needed to stay in Pacific Grove."
4697656,140078244,2017-03-27,61332338,Myra,"Pacific Grove is one of my favorite places to visit and stay! Traveling alone, the accommodation was perfect for my needs. Stacy was a wonderful host! She made me feel welcome and at home. The fresh bakery bread toasted was unforgettable. I enjoyed my room, decor ( art), and Stacy's personal touches. I recommend to couples and solo travelers! "
4697656,141561879,2017-04-03,57191960,(Email hidden by Airbnb),"A beautiful ,warm and cozy accommodation. 
Me and my wife had a great time and hope to come back again. "
4697656,142926226,2017-04-09,20181492,Gosia,"Stacey's place is in a great location, very quiet and peaceful, which are very important qualities for me when I travel. The bed and pillows are super comfortable, and I am very particular about pillows. Loved seeing the redwood tree as I awoke in the morning. This is a sweet option when attending a workshop at Asilomar, a couple minutes drive down the street, and very centrally located for exploring Carmel, Pacific Grove or Monterey. Stacey is very easy to communicate with, sociable and respectful of privacy and space if that's what you need.  Great suggestion for dinner - I  enjoyed Red House Café twice!!! Thanks for your hospitality! Would love to stay here again if I'm ever in the area."
4697656,144794431,2017-04-16,56256454,Nicole,"Stacey was so lovely! She was extremely welcoming, even had delicious cookies waiting for us upon arrival :) The room was a nice size and had everything that we needed, simple and cute. She does have 2 dogs but they are very friendly and don't bother anyone. Stacy made sure we were taken care of and comfortable. Thanks Stacey!!!! You were an amazing host. "
4697656,146819515,2017-04-23,686584,Giovanni Luca,"Stacey is such a terrific host that I wish I could come back and spend more time in Pacific Grove. I highly recommend her place. Thank you for the bread and jam, it was delicious!"

4697656,152051811,2017-05-14,4728103,Nebojsa,"Stacey has a lovely home and personality. It was one of the sweetest stays. :) Thank you for listening to my words, and also for sharing your thoughts by the fireplace in living room. It's that rare moment where you speak openly with a person from totally different part of the world. I learned something, had a nice stay in lovely room and a great bed, and left with smile on my face :) Maybe see you soon again. "
4697656,153770663,2017-05-21,47677830,Jerry,"Stacey's and her home are brilliant, not to add her two beautiful members of the family who love attention and some snacks (all well loved dogs do) "
4697656,156437768,2017-05-30,123142394,Joe,"Our stay at Stacey's place was nothing short of excellent. She was a very welcoming host with some great restaurant suggestions and an incredibly warm personality. Her home is very cozy and offers convenient proximity to cool locations like the beach, cannery row, and the aquarium. 10 outta 10, would stay here again."
4697656,157823905,2017-06-04,16262447,Roberta,"Stacey's place was very lovely. I'm felt like I was at a friends cottage for the weekend. Stacey is very friendly, thoughtful and easy to communicate with. Great location for the Pacific Grove/Monterey/Carmel area.
We would recommend this place and would visit again. The only thing I would remind myself or others to bring, is warm clothes, as the place is quiet cool. The room does have extra blankets in it 😊 Thank you Stacey, for sharing your lovely home with us ❤"
4697656,159804691,2017-06-11,4779215,Sara,"I had a wonderful stay in this room! I traveled to Monterey for a conference at the Middlebury Institute downtown, which I found to be an easy 5-10 minute drive from Stacey's home. I wasn't familiar with Pacific Grove before this trip, but I found it to be a welcome retreat from downtown Monterey, with quick access to beautiful seashore areas like Asilomar Beach and Lover's Point. For less than the cost of staying in a downtown hotel, I was able to stay at Stacey's, rent a car, and visit the rocky coast every morning and evening on my way to/from the conference.

Stacey's kind, thoughtful presence is what really makes this rental stand out. She checked in before my visit and throughout my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. Her thorough information and reminders ensured that my whole trip went smoothly. I appreciated the coffee maker, snacks, and supplies she provided (even used some lavender bath salts to take a soothing bath after my conference talk).  I appreciated the solitude of my clean, quiet room and private bathroom, which were just as advertised on Airbnb--but I also felt welcome to enjoy the house's living room and shared spaces with Stacey and the dogs. Highly recommended for solo travelers like me, and I can't wait to come back for a romantic trip with my partner!"
4697656,161766020,2017-06-18,118431807,Natalie,"Perfect location for getting to Hwy 1, Point Lobos, Carmel by the Sea, Monterey  Bay and all the fun things to experience in and around Pacific Grove. Stacey is a wonderful host. Her suggestions for breakfast, lunch or dinner are spot on. If you are looking for comfort and convenience with hospitality, this is the Airbnb for you."

4697656,181462924,2017-08-12,130132613,Shelley,"Stacey is a fabulous host and was very welcoming when we arrived. She was happy to share her home (and dogs) with us. The room is spacious and has lots of storage space. The area is quiet but close to the aquarium and 17 mile drive. Stacey provided us with toast, coffee and amazing biscotti. I could not have asked for a better host, Stacey is wonderful company and we had a great time talking with her. It was like talking to someone you had known for years. Honestly, we felt sad to leave :)"
4697656,186859078,2017-08-25,4214329,Josh,"Stacey is a superhost! Although we didn't cross paths during my stay, Stacey was responsive and communicative about directions, check in, check out, etc. I would gladly visit again."
4697656,190661992,2017-09-04,24405091,William R.,"Stacey was a wonderful host and the space we were in was cosy and really wonderful. We found that the distance between our personal space and the restroom was a little inconvenient and as sweet as her dogs were they did bark every time we came by. All of that said, it was a great AirBnB experience. She was incredibly open, easy going and accommodating. I highly recommend staying with her."
4697656,195268627,2017-09-18,20744292,Joe,Stacey is an excellent host.  The room was great!  Very comfortable. 5 stars.

4697656,207685981,2017-10-29,84965749,Scott,"Had an amazing time in Pacific Grove! Stacey's house is in a very quiet neighborhood, but very close to all the sights in Monterey and Carmel. We hadn't been to Pacific Grove before, but it turned out to be the perfect location. The downtown is so quaint, and all of Stacey's dining options were spot on! Not to mention the running routes she suggested took us by all the sights - historical homes, golf courses, beaches, the lighthouse, parks, 17 Mile Drive, etc. 
We loved Stacey's house as well (along with her cute pups - we are dog people). We also loved getting to know Stacey herself. If we are ever visiting the area again, we will definitely be booking the room at Stacey's place!"
4697656,211859553,2017-11-14,73286351,Rainer,Der Aufenthalt bei Stacey war sehr schön. Sie ist eine angenehme Gastgeberin. Sie ist kommunikativ und tolerant. Die Unterkunft ist hell und freundlich.

5185545,27559306,2015-03-07,28472244,刘,"This is my first time to visit US and also the first time using Airbnb. I felt I were very lucky to pick Sarah and Young's beach bungalow.
 
First, the content and effects of the photos presented were absolutely true. This is the most important and a must since a lot of visitors like us choose places based on those pictures. A blue-green paint finish in this pacific grove seaside cottage was extraordinarily fresh and bright. When we arrived there, we already had a feeling that a pleasant, comfortable and romantic holiday was coming...

The bungalow is furnished simple and elegant, very tide and clean.  It is equipped with high quality home appliances. The exquisite kitchen has everything you need for cooking at home.  You can enjoy a cup of tea or/and wine at the backyard where was very sunny and bright during the day, and quiet and full of stars during the evening. Finally, there is a comfy queen size bed to sleep (there is another bedroom with two twin beds for more people).

Secondly, the scenery around the bungalow is beautiful. Deer walking around the golf course, cute squirrels jump around in the backyard. It is really true that it only takes three minutes to walk to the beach. We watched some beautiful sunsets. The down town is about 2 miles away, there are a variety of restaurants,  ATM, CVS, very convenient . If you stay more than two nights, Sarah will share two free Monterey Bay Aquarium passes, one of the nation's largest aquarium, sea otters, sea lions and various small octopus, and lovely jellyfish, definitely worth a visit!

Finally, the more commendable and pleasing scenery is Ms. Sarah and Mr. Young. They are very warm and enthusiastic loving people that will give you a detailed description with patience when they greet you. They always put our needs first. Sarah speaks Chinese, Young doesn't, but he will quietly listen to Sarah, and supplement when needed (in fact, the full house is filled with Sarah and Young's love).

Five nights at this beautiful and cozy Pacific Grove house gives me wonderful memories of PG.  If you visit PG, choose this house, you will not regret it!

我在第一次到美国,第一次使用airbnb的时候选择了Sarah女士和Young先生的海边小屋,现在 想来真是无比幸运的。
 
首先,照片上所呈现的内容和效果绝对真实,这是最基本和最重要的。一幢蓝绿色外漆的小屋在 pacific grove 海边显得格外清新明快,当驱车抵达这里,一段温馨浪漫愉悦舒适的假期已经悄然而至。

家里布置得干净整齐,室内装修和陈设简洁精致,家电家具品质上乘,厨房卫浴配置讲究,这一点非常赞。 意味着在这个假期里,你能品尝到亲手烹 制的美食(6位灶具锅碗瓢盆柴米油盐一应俱全),能享受到高效的家居生活(洗碗洗衣烘干机可以完全解放双 手),能在后院的木椅上小酌两杯欣赏月亮星星(小 院白天阳光充足,夜晚静谧美丽),最后在温暖柔软的大床上进入梦乡(如果多人同行还有另一间卧室哦)。

其次,小屋周围的景色非常好,出门有小鹿,抬头有松鼠;步行三分钟就能到海边,看日落,看海景,看森 林。开车三公里就能在镇上吃到各种美 食,日常所需的atm,24小时超市也都有,所以便利程度完全不用担心。如果住的时间较长,Sarah还会 附上monterey bay海洋馆的卡,那是全美最大的海洋馆之一,海狮海獭水母八爪还有各种小萌萌,值得一去!

最后,比赏心悦目的景色更值得称赞的是Sarah 女士和Young先生,他们都是非常温暖热心有爱的人,见面时会给你进行耐心而详尽的介绍,有任何疑问和需要也会第一时间进行解答和提供帮助。sarah 可以说中文,young虽然不会中文但都会静静地听然后给sarah补充(好有爱吧?其实只要留心就会发现 这是一间充满了Sarah和Young爱意的 house哦!)

住在这里的日子是我在Pacific Grove美好幸福的回忆,希望你们如果来到PG,也选择这里!"

The house was very nicely arranged, spacious and completely renovated. We had several nice sunny days with local tours and we will be happy to return to this beautiful part of Califonia. We did a boat trip and saw glimpses of Killer Whales, dolphins and sea otters and we went to the nice Monterey Aquarium. The boat trip was a bit bumpy but it was just me by my whole family who became seasick.
Yours sincerely Anna & Family"
5185545,28008007,2015-03-16,27244274,Meghan,We loved staying in this sweet bungalow! It was so nice to have all the comforts of home while we were away from home! We have a 2 year old and a 3 month old and the place was perfect for them as well. The walk-ability to the ocean and the golf course was perfect and the discounted aquarium tickets were definitely a plus! We will be staying again in the future whenever we come up this way. Thanks for your hospitality Sara!!
5185545,28317735,2015-03-22,8986182,Darlene,"We had a wonderful time at Sarah and Young's adorable beach bungalow.  We were running away from the cold and snow of upstate New York and this was a great place to land.  This was our first experience renting on Airbnb and will not be our last!  We were delighted that the home was even better than the pictures.  Sarah and Young are great hosts, making sure that we had everything we needed to have a wonderful vacation.  
We totally enjoyed the location, just a short distance to the magnificent Monterey Bay, the area sights, such as 17 Mile Drive and the Aquarium, as well as a short trek to the local Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  
We can't wait to come back again next winter!

5185545,28653786,2015-03-28,26694774,Meg,"This place is FANTASTIC! Sarah and Young made us feel incredibly welcome at their house in Pacific Grove. They met us at check-in and gave us a tour of the house and lots of information about area sites. They were very warm, welcoming and kind. Prior to meeting them Sarah was very quick to respond to all of my questions, which made me feel more at ease about renting the house (this was my first airbnb experience).

I love this house! The house was exactly as pictured and listed. Everything was updated and incredibly clean. It was airy, yet cozy at the same time. The beds and all furniture were very comfy. The washer and dryer was great since we were traveling with kids. The house is very kid friendly. There is one step down into the sunroom that was a little tough for our crawling 9 month old to navigate, but we just kept a close eye on him and he mastered it pretty quickly. Our 2 year old took a few dives off of it too, but running fast and falling is just his nature. They do have it clearly marked so for adults it shouldn't be a problem.

The neighborhood was one of the best things about this house (and the house was awesome) for us. It was in a very clean, quiet and safe residential area. There is a bus stop right outside, which we took advantage of and met some great people from the community. The bus goes to cannery row and the aquarium and was a great alternative to driving. The water is a 3 minute walk, but it is pretty rocky. However, if you walk about a quarter mile up there is a little beach with great tide pools to explore. 

The house is located very close to a golf course and about a mile or two away from Asilomar State Beach which is gorgeous and sandy. Downtown Pacific Grove is about a mile away so definitely within walking distance, and a very nice children's park is just under a mile walk too. I would recommend checking out the the Farmer's Market in PG on Mondays as it was such a treat to get local, fresh and tasty produce.  

I  just can't say enough good things about this house and the area. We spent a week here and I could have easily spent much more time. Sarah and Young have a very good thing going here and you would be bananas to pass up the opportunity to stay here!"
5185545,29102950,2015-04-04,12776439,Alvaro,"The house is fantastic, located in a beatiful, quiet neighborhood. It is appointed with all the conveniences required. It was also perfectly clean. It is actually prtettier than it looks in the photos and I would definitely stathere again.

Sarah and Young were very helpful and polite and the check-in information that they gave us was very useful, especially their recommendations for places to shop for groceries and to eat."
5185545,29280163,2015-04-06,718323,Kavitha & Reza,"We had a great experience at this lovely bungalow in Pacific Grove.  It was a clean, bright and airy space for our family to relax and enjoy being away from the city hustle and bustle. The beach was so close for lovely walks along the trail, and we were only a few minutes drive away from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Fishermans Wharf and other attractions.  Sarah was quick to respond with any questions we had. We hope to be back again soon!"
5185545,29496435,2015-04-08,28060360,Charlotte,"We stayed 2 nights, travelling with 2 kids. The bungalow was perfect for your family, we had a brilliant stay in Monterrey. The location is great, it's just a few minutes away from the coast and super quiet, we felt completely safe. There is plenty of space inside and also a cute patio. Everything was in good condition and clean. I would recommend it!"
5185545,29828847,2015-04-13,2884925,Sara,We absolutely love this beach house! It was so cute and cozy. It was conveniently located-walking distance to ocean! Our family will definitely come back when we visit the area again. The hosts were so kind and responded very fast anytime we had a question. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!
5185545,30045418,2015-04-16,4586298,Megan,"We arrived to the house around 8 pm after hitting some traffic on our way down from San Jose. Although Sarah was unable to meet us, it was very easy to get in and everything was nicely laid out and self explanatory. The kitchen was well stocked with everything but the one thing we ended up needing, a baking sheet. The location is great and easy to find, just a short distance to the ocean, shops, the aquarium, etc. We definitely enjoyed our stay and would return if we come back to the Monterey area! Thank you Sarah and Young!"
5185545,30286014,2015-04-20,13677496,Timothy,"Sarah was great,  everything was made easy through her quick response to emails.  "
5185545,31185822,2015-05-03,28874715,Christian,"This house is just the perfect place for a family vacation in Pacific Grove. It is just 3 minutes away from the coastal road with its awesome vista. The house is in a rather quiet neighbourhood and has been renovated only recently, and Sarah did a great job. We spent 4 nights there and had a wonderful time. Since we had 70+ deg during our stay our kids enjoyed playing in the stone garden where you also find a dining table. As a family, we also appreciated that there is a washing mashine in the house. There are also two entry tickets for the Monterey Aquarium for free use. In summary: the perfect house in a perfect place. Thank you for the nice stay."
5185545,31510492,2015-05-06,27532654,Daniel,"We really loved this house! The perfect size for our party of 4 adults and 1 toddler. Everything needed was in place and the remodeled kitchen was just awesome. In fact, the whole house looked almost brand new. The house is located just a few blocks from the ocean and a short distance to downtown Pacific Grove. Sarah and Young are very nice and easy to communicate with. We will definitely be back!"
5185545,31790889,2015-05-10,21616831,Michelle,"This beach bungalow is beautiful!  Sarah was not able to meet us when we arrived, but everything was explained in our welcome letter and the bungalow is set up so that it was very easy to find everything and feel at home right away.  Sarah is easy to get hold of if needed and very sweet, we were able to meet at the end of our stay and enjoyed our chat. The neighborhood is gorgeous and gives that coastal feel us midwesterners were looking for and the walk to the coast is quick and easy with little ones. The town is quaint, wonderful and very relaxing, we really enjoyed our time spent exploring. The coast is amazing! The aquarium passes were a fantastic bonus and the aquarium was one of the highlights of our trip. The Peaceful Cozy Beach Bungalow surpassed our expectations, we highly recommend! "
5185545,32052125,2015-05-13,4750272,Birgit,"The bungalow is just wonderful and well located in a quiet & safe neighborhood. Everything was in a very good condition and perfectly clean. We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed every minute. Sarah met us at check in and gave us lots of information about the house and the area: attractions, places to eat & shop for groceries. The coast is in walking distance only a few blocks away. We visited the Monterey Aquarium (thank you for the 2 entry tickets) and we also did the 17 Miles Drive. 
Thank you Sarah and Young for having had us. We definitely recommend it and hope we can stay there again sometime in the near future.

5185545,32676399,2015-05-20,27415695,Devon,Wow! This place is beautiful. I brought my parents here for a quick weekend getaway and we were not disappointed. We would definitely come back. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!

5185545,33775606,2015-06-01,2520264,Sarah,"We had friends visiting from the UK that wanted to go to Big Sur and do other things in Monterey Bay.  This house is perfectly located to do everything we needed during our weekend.  It's in a sleepy neighborhood with just a quick walk to the beach.  it is a very simple house with 5 areas to sit and talk, eat, drink, play cards etc. - 4 in the house and 1 out back.  The gardens are drought friendly (yay!) and the aesthetic is modern.  Young and Sarah were very welcoming and everything you need to know is emailed about a week in advance.  All four of us agreed - so much better than any hotel.  We will be back and will definitely recommend.  Loved it here."

5185545,37036176,2015-07-04,6575395,Abigail,"I'm speechless over Sarah's bungalow. This was, by far, our best AirBnB experience yet. The bungalow is freshly renovated, adorably decorated, and located seconds from the beach. It was equipped with everything we needed and so convenient to all of Monterey's attractions. We would rebook here in a second!"
5185545,37741971,2015-07-10,19607466,Melanie,The home was lovely and incredibly clean! We were a very short walk to the ocean and had easy access to downtown and Monterey. I highly recommend this spot for a family vacation!

The wildlife was amazing as the whales decided to grace our presence for the week feeding right off shore. The 2 tickets to the aquarium was helpful and I thank Sarah for that. It is a nice compliment to for the rental. I only wish we had time to stay longer!!!

5185545,41589316,2015-08-08,31910471,Eveline,"My husband and children aged 19 and 16 visiting from the UK loved this bungalow in Pacific Grove.  As we're from England and were having difficulty obtaining a good cup of tea on our travels through California I, especially, was delighted that a kettle and tea bags were provided!

The accommodation was in pristine condition with beautiful furnishings throughout.  The location is great, in a quite neighbourhood within very easy walking distance of the coast and a little further to shops/restaurants.

We would love to return and spend longer here as there is so much to see in the region.

Thank you to Sarah and Young for your hospitality."
5185545,41918815,2015-08-10,21847009,John,"Great peaceful spot for exploring Monterey: the area is more sizeable than we had imagined; Sarah's house is in a perfect position to explore by foot, bike or car. We mainly walked and biked but used the car to go to the shops. The house is clean and very comfortable; the area is very quiet and relaxing. The aquarium passes were a great bonus. Sarah was the perfect host helping to answer our questions especially with changes in our travel plans. We loved it. Thank you."

We especially enjoyed the back patio for eating breakfast. I will try to stay here again next time I am coming to the area and would heartily recommend it to anyone! Sarah was a great host and there was nothing I would change about experience here. Thank you so much!

5185545,50611676,2015-10-13,26859217,Chris,"Sarah and Young were fantastic hosts.  They provided us with our access information a week in advance so we didn't have to scramble or chase them down to gain access to the bungalow.   They were very responsive, and even sent us a quick note on checkout day with a few reminders.

The bungalow, ah, the bungalow.   It was heaven.   The bungalow had everything we could ask for.    It was very well maintained, decorated and you could tell that Sarah and Young take great pride in their property.  It was spotless, the linens were high end, and the entire place was absolutely gorgeous.   

If the beach, or incredible views took too much energy, the backyard is an oasis in itself.   The bungalow is situated on an incredibly quiet street.  When you open the windows, you get to hear the sound of the waves from the ocean (which did I mention was only a block away).  

Pacific Grove/Monterey is such a charming place to stay.  Sarah and Young's bungalow takes your stay from good to great.   My wife and I will definitely come back and stay with Sarah and Young again!

Thank you both for making our stay so very special!"

Unfortunately the local area had a power cut on the day we arrived making the first evening difficult - but the hosts were helpful and meeted us on arrival. The place is a wonderful location and a short walk to the sea and drive to a beach. The place was well equipped and is an ideal stop when travelling between LA and San Francisco. Only improvement would be a BBQ in the garden...Thanks!

Le quartier est très calme, c'est un quartier résidentiel, proche de l'océan. La maison est magnifique, très confortable. Tout y est très bien indiqué, on trouve facilement ce dont on a besoin.

The house is actually large with a pleasant, private rear garden with nice furniture. The kitchen is super equipped and we were inspired to cook in almost every night of our stay. Beds were comfortable and assured a restful stay.  The neighborhood is quiet and near the shoreline, perfect for walks in the morning or evening.
This is really a top choice for staying in Pacific Grove near the shore."

The home was very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood was quiet and ""coastal"" with small cottages all around. The people in the neighborhood were friendly when we took a walk. My sister and brother were able to visit and there was room to sit around the table together.  The kitchen was well equipped for cooking up some of the local food. And the house was a comfortable stroll to watch the ocean waves."

The location is ideal - so close to restaurants, the aquarium, and just a 5 minute walk to the beautiful Pacific Grove coast.  The house is on a quiet street.  We didn't hear a peep from anyone the whole time we were there.  TV and internet reception were a bit spotty, but the hosts were very responsive to help solve the connection issues.   We were so happy to stay in this home and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Monterey / Pacific Grove area."

The house was exactly as described - peaceful, cozy and two blocks from the beach.  Although it was too cold to use the back patio, it was a lovely sight to look at from indoors - it would be a great bonus in warmer weather.  The house was well organized and thoughtfully furnished.  I would definitely book this house again."

The house was great and Pacific Grove is a great vacation place even in the winter providing access to Monterey and Carmel.  "
5185545,59560950,2016-01-12,801204,Sarina,We had a fabulous time in Pacific Grove. Sarah's house is on a beautiful quiet street with plenty of space and a nice yard. Gorgeous furniture and great appliances in a spotlessly clean house. We wouldn't dream of stayi anywhere else in Pacific Grove when we come back. Thanks for being such a great host!
5185545,59824072,2016-01-16,6348686,Barbara,Sarah made us feel very welcome.The check in and check out process was easy.
5185545,60289750,2016-01-21,53233063,Jada,"We had a great family getaway for a few days in Pacific Grove. Sarah's house is adorable and just the right size for us. It was a quick walk to the beach where you could walk the trail along the ocean side. And just a short drive to everything, PG downtown(for great food and coffee) and the aquarium , where we spent one of the rainy days we were there. It truly felt like a home away from home and we would love to go back when the weather is warmer! Sarah was such an easy person to deal with. She answered any and all questions we had very quickly! I highly recommend you stay here!"
5185545,60818816,2016-01-28,229907,Ian,"Sarah, your house was pristine, beautifully presented and a pleasure to stay in. It is well located with easy access to the beach and a stroll along the ocean. You communicate the guide to your house in great detail which makes things easy to find or operate. I highly recommend your house to others and want you to know that we really enjoyed our stay. "
5185545,61569775,2016-02-06,18263570,Emily,"Young and Sarah were the best host! I received emails with detailed information regarding the home, neighborhood, even restaurants. Every accommadation you could think of was provided. Monterey is such a beautiful coastline! My husband and I felt so honored to be able to stay here. The listing description was accurate and even better in person. The neighborhood was quite, the people were friendly, the free aquarium passes and the walk to the coastline is short and breathtaking. We will absolutely be coming back."
5185545,61925683,2016-02-09,22532863,Janet,This little bungalow is in the perfect location. We enjoyed it's proximity to the coastal walking/biking trail. The house is kept very clean and is in brand new condition. It has a sunroom on the backside of the house that opens up to a wonderful yard with outdoor seating. We look forward to visiting again.
5185545,62230478,2016-02-13,28314396,Lindsey,"My new husband & I had the most wonderful time staying in this Pacific Grove bungalow! The home is so open, aesthetically pleasing, and welcoming. Our gracious hosts even left us with a bottle of wine! One of the best parts of the location is that it's so central. It's only a quick 5 min walk to the coastal trail that winds in parallel with the ocean all the way to Monterey! We walked everywhere. We walked to the aquarium, which is only 1.8 miles away. We walked into the town of Pacific Grove to coffee shops, bakeries, and other delicious eateries. It was lovely being able to come back to our own peaceful little space! The backyard is a great asset as well, complete with a couple of adirondack chairs for lounging the day away. If you're coming to the Monterey area, I'd definitely recommend staying here!! We have absolutely no complaints. Everything was comfortable & easy & wonderful."
5185545,62700162,2016-02-16,19473297,Maddy,"We had a wonderful time in Pacific Grove. Sarah and Young are great hosts! That sent us detailed instructions of everything before we arrived and then checked in with us once we got there. Their place is beautiful, clean, inviting, and cozy. And the location is incredible. It's only a short walk to the beach and tide pools. Thanks again for an incredible weekend! "
5185545,63341609,2016-02-22,25458381,Nicky,"Our favourite vacation rental to date. Sarah was very welcoming and organised, the location great and the home gorgeous. Would thoroughly recommend.
"
5185545,63659851,2016-02-25,53106063,Jackie,"We loved this home!  Sarah's home was very clean., well appointed and had everything we needed.  The location is superb.  The aquarium passes were an extra bonus.  We have already recommended this beautiful home to family and friends.  We hope to return soon!"
5185545,63795528,2016-02-27,19137182,Andrea,Sarah contacted me within 5 minutes of our arrival and was very communicative. The house and neighborhood surpassed my expections since it was quiet and private. The house is very clean and well equiped
5185545,64204862,2016-03-01,449721,Ryan,"Great house in a beautiful location.  Sarah was awesome to work with.  At one point the shower head broke from previous tenants, but Sarah had the problem fixed within the hour.   I've used AirBnB a lot, but this was one of my best experiences yet.  Thanks, Sarah!"
5185545,64503677,2016-03-05,13041710,Stephanie,"The cozy beach bungalow was exactly that--a cozy home right near the picturesque beach.  It was a very clean home with tons of amenities.  Even better than the space is the quick walk to the beautiful beach.  We walked everywhere--to Pacific Grove, to the Monterey Aquarium.  It was a great time."
5185545,64805451,2016-03-08,26795671,Tamara,Beautiful place and fantastic location. We had everything we needed and hosts were responsive and helpful. 
5185545,66033878,2016-03-19,6625861,Cheryl,The home in Pacific Grove was delightful and such a short walk to one of the most beautiful coastal pathways in the world.  The home had a spacious and private backyard.  Sarah was great about communicating and we found everything just as described.  We will be back!
5185545,66413200,2016-03-22,22099110,Lauren,"The house is very cute and Pacific Grove is a wonderful town. Great location for exploring all of Monterey and Carmel.  The hosts are very thorough and detailed. The only thing I would warn potential guests of is the house is advertised for up to 4 guests(4 little body icons) on the home page at first glance (2 bedroom -3bed). It is not until you look further into it that they charge an additional $20/day/guest for more than 2 guests. We had a third guest last minute and didn't even think about it because it is an entire house, why wouldn't a 3rd person be okay. The hosts later pointed out this was stated under a different sections and we paid the additional money. At the end of the day, it is my fault. I didn't go back and re-examine the rules. They stated the additional charge is because their house cleaning service charges for more than 2 guests. $20/day/guest is way more then a cleaning co would charge for an extra load of laundry. They are still cleaning the house the same regardless if it is 2 vs 3 guests. That would even cover more than water used that whole weekend at $20/day.  Its a fantastic place, quaint, right next to the ocean, but if you have more than 2 guests, I would consider choosing a house that doesn't charge for additional guests up to 4 people. "
5185545,66869688,2016-03-25,43620703,Van,"The pictures don't do it justice.  Immaculate place, with a designer touch and a fab location with lots to see within walking distance.  Backyard was a retreat, and the house in total has plenty of room.  The only downside is  there is only 1 bathroom.  Overall, highly recommended."
5185545,67834954,2016-03-31,5161093,Jenny,"Amazing little house and a nice quiet area for sleeping.
Would stay again.
Sarah was so helpful and efficient about everything
Thanks for wonderful stay
Jenny"
5185545,68876312,2016-04-07,34943025,John,"A perfect Airbnb experience. After booking Sarah and Young were so helpful with communicating with us, and we had a wonderful stay. 

The house is a beautiful cottage a couple of minutes' walk from the ocean. It was so comfortable and we'll set up, with a great kitchen and super back yard which was perfect for relaxing in the sun.

The location is just ideal - a short walk into Downtown Pacific Grove, and easily walkable along the coast to Monterey with all its attractions, including Cannery Row and the Aquarium.

It is a perfect base for exploring nearby Carmel, Point Lobos and the Pacific Coast.

We had a great stay in this perfect house and would highly recommend it to others."
5185545,70038845,2016-04-15,14280760,Charity,"Sarah and Young were great hosts- very friendly and helpful interactions.  The house itself was lovely, and even nicer than in the pictures.  It was clean, nicely decorated, and felt homey.  It was a few minute walk to the trail along the coast and an easy walk to the shops and restaurants of downtown Pacific Grove.  Pacific Grove is a great place to stay while exploring the Monterey Peninsula- it has a nice hometown feel.  Asilomar State Beach is minutes away, and it is an easy drive to Big Sur.  The aquarium passes were much appreciated as well. I highly recommend this home- we'd love to come back again sometime!"
5185545,70571797,2016-04-18,15426069,John & Catherine,"We had a lovely stay at Sarah and Young's bungalow. We loved the residential area and Pacific Grove is delightful - especially the walk along the coast. The historic downtown of Pacific Grove is well worth a visit. 
The house is nicely and newly furnished with lots of living area seating in different places. We enjoyed making use of the aquarium passes and spent the whole day there. Thank you Sarah for being so helpful! We would definitely love to stay here again if we were able to come to the area again. "
5185545,70788427,2016-04-20,60706108,Robin,"Stayed in Sarah's beautiful bungalow for 2 nights. Place was immaculate and she had some really nice thoughtful touches in there that made it even better than imagined. Shops, laundry mats, and most importantly, the sea, are all really close by and we took full advantage of that. We used her place to discover Big Sur and the whole region was beautiful beyond words. Sarah is very communicative. I didn't get to meet her personally but she came across as really amicable and helpful. Hopefully the feeling was mutual because I would love to stay there again if I'm in the area. "
5185545,71118739,2016-04-23,53637357,Dylan,"My husband and I had the most wonderful, relaxing stay at this beautiful home! It is exactly as described on airbnb and located so close to the ocean that it was perfect for morning walks and runs along the ocean. It is also a short, walkable distance from town - it was perfectly secluded in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood but we also enjoyed being able to easily walk to dinners and shops.

Everything in the home was thoughtfully laid out and cared for. It was extremely clean and was truly a zen environment for a relaxing stay. The hosts have thought of everything a visitor might need from little things that made our stay comfortable to generously providing aquarium passes (a highlight of our trip!).

The bedrooms, living space, and kitchen are spacious and as seen in the pictures, and the outdoor patio was perfect for spending time outside. We have been raving about this place since we left and will definitely be back!!"
5185545,71417119,2016-04-25,15275150,Amber,We had a wonderful stay at Sarah's cute and cozy home.  Quiet neighborhood close to downtown Pacific Grove and Monterey and only 2 blocks from the ocean...you can hear the waves at night!  Home was impeccably clean and inviting with fluffy towels and relaxing back patio.  Very private.  Aquarium guest passes were easy to use and wifi was strong for planning our daily adventures.  Wished we could have stayed longer!
5185545,71749888,2016-04-28,27241523,Danielle,"Sarah and Young's home was beautiful and perfectly located for a visit to Monterey Bay and Big Sur. Sarah communicated directions and instructions for our stay so well, any questions we had were covered from the beginning of our stay and we felt quite accommodated and comfortable. I would recommend this Airbnb to any friend of mine and would stay again in a heartbeat."
5185545,72449927,2016-05-02,46834477,Philipp,"It is a wonderful place, in a perfect location, right beside the sea.
We had a very good vacation at this cottage: enough space, it was clean and it is really located in a quiet area.
The fact that you can walk to the Monteray Bay Aquarium, with your unexpected ""two free passes"" was our personal high-light."
5185545,73119429,2016-05-07,2366817,Mary,"Stunning location , beautiful house, with everything you might need to feel at home. Very clean, bright and spacious. Only regret is we didn't have longer - so many attractions in the area with or without the car. Sarah & Young were prompt with all queries and gave clear directions on how to arrive."
5185545,73962326,2016-05-11,12246514,Erica,"I cannot say enough good things about this home- we had a lovely stay! First of all, it was pristinely clean. Secondly, the pictures are very accurate. The entire home is really well designed and thought-through. I wish we had had more time (and sunshine) to enjoy the backyard as that was one area that I was pleasantly surprised at. It was incredibly inviting. The kitchen is well-equipped, the shower had great pressure, every thing is labeled so you aren't spending excess time searching for things, the house is close to absolutely everything you would want or need, and the neighborhood is quiet and really nice. I would love to stay again and would recommend to family and friends. Thank you for sharing your home with us!!"
5185545,74232232,2016-05-14,26531138,Ling,"My family and I had an wonderful stay at Sarah's house. It is conveniently located just a couple of blocks to the sea, which was perfect for a morning run or a view of the sunset. We managed to take day trips out to explore Carmel and the Big Sur coast, which were simply stunning. 

The house is very well stocked, and the living/dining room area is extremely spacious. The queen-sized bed was also exceptionally comfortable!"
5185545,75019027,2016-05-18,20011070,Cathy,Great place to stay and a gorgeous little house. So well organised and Sarah and Young are super quick to respond on any questions. Pacific Grove is a great base for the Monterey peninsula - walking distance into town - and also getting out down the Big Sur.  The aquarium passes were an unexpected bonus as well.  Thanks guys!
5185545,75409970,2016-05-21,55718112,Alexandra,"The house was very modern, secure, spacious and clean. It was a very quiet location, not far from the ocean. It was nice to sit outside in the backyard and hear the waves. We highly recommend."
5185545,77517257,2016-06-01,32148018,Kristin,Great home that met our expectations for Pacific Grove. House was even cuter in person and met our needs even with two small children. We appreciated the guest passes to aquarium. Short walk to the coast with scenic views. We are very happy we stayed here!
5185545,77962385,2016-06-04,7333985,Jule,"This was a yummy place to stay. Sarah and Young were most attentive hosts, and most gracious. They were quick to respond and lovely to work with. The bungalow is well-appointed -- best bed we have slept in during our years with airbnb. The sheets were especially good. It was obvious that this home had been constructed with luxury in mind, as well as function. 
The neighborhood was quiet and sweet -- a good location to be away yet so close to the downtown of Pacific Grove and a block or so from the ocean. Also it was a perfect place for 4 people. 
Have to mention the marvelous garden. Flowers everywhere. Fields of daisies. This will be our home away from home when we are visiting family in Monterey."
5185545,78389219,2016-06-06,6083430,Cindy + Brent,"Communication with Sarah was prompt and considerate. Home is cozy with an open floor plan, very clean, well appointed/all new, in a quiet neighborhood, and 2 blocks from the beach walking path. Beautiful home to unwind and feel at home. Close to downtown Pacific Grove, as well as Asilomar. 5-8 minute drive to Monterey Bay Aquarium. Would stay at Sarah and Young's home again if we're in the area."
5185545,79340679,2016-06-12,7556788,Brian,"We wanted to find a nice place to stay for the Pacific Grove Triathlon and this fit the bill. It was the perfect location, close to downtown and the start of the event. Sarah did a great job of making us feel right at home and setting up the house."
5185545,81202206,2016-06-21,25287182,D & M,We found a nice little house with a beautiful garden. It has been so nice to relax there. Thank you!
5185545,82815241,2016-06-29,20278792,Leslie,"Sarah's home was such a welcoming place to land, allowing us to truly experience Pacific Grove and all that it had to offer.  Her home was extremely clean, had everything that we needed, was so comfortable for our family of 4, and provided a home away from home feel immediately.  We have already been talking about when we will come next and stay there again!  

We loved that we were able to park our vehicle for 5 days and use the great bike path to ride everywhere...the beach, downtown for dinner, the Aquarium, the lighthouse, the coast.  We were lucky enough to see sea otters and seals in our daily bike rides along the coast, and spent hours just enjoying the sea life.  A very relaxing trip all around, just what we needed after driving from Colorado!"
5185545,85164714,2016-07-10,41499942,Sangita,"This was the best airbnb place we've rented - clean, organized, comfortable resting place and a great location. We spent a week at this house exploring Big Sur area, Carmel Valley wineries and Pacific Grove/Monterey area. I can't say enough about this place - backyard was awesome too. Really good value for your money. Thank you, Sarah. If we are ever back in the area, we'd rent the same place again!"
5185545,87344734,2016-07-19,26859217,Chris,"Sarah and Young are not your average hosts on Airbnb - they go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.   Whether it is booking their incredible bungalow, or even receiving a quick note a couple of weeks leading to your stay, or even checking in to make sure you arrived safely, they are exceptionally attentive to ensuring a smooth and pleasurable stay.   This is our second time staying at the bungalow over the last year - and we love it.  We fell in love with the bungalow's charm, the cleanliness, and most importantly, the way it makes you feel at home. 

The bungalow is nestled in a quiet area, literally only a couple of blocks from the ocean.  Breathtaking sunsets are a five minute walk  down the street, which we highly suggest seeing when you're in town.  A notable memory always is seeing the deer leisurely walk around the neighbourhood with locals being very welcoming to them.

Sarah and Young have a great house book with all the top recommendations in the area.   We have fallen in love with Pacific Grove based on a lot of their recommendations - and by staying at the bungalow, we are sure you will too!

Thank you Sarah and Young for making our stay so wonderful.

5185545,89068298,2016-07-26,40540102,Patti,"My husband and I stayed in this beautiful beach bungalow for a week. It is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood just two blocks from the ocean.  The home has wonderful indoor spaces for dining, and relaxing, as well as  great backyard patio for enjoying the outdoors!  I would highly recommend this home and hope to stay here again!!"
5185545,91321234,2016-08-04,51426794,Jen,"Sarah and Young's Bungalow was absolutely gorgeous and spotless on our arrival. It lived up to everything we had expected and more. We cooked in a few of the nights while we were there and the bungalow had everything we needed to facilitate this. It was a few minutes walk to the beach, right next to a Golf Course and a few minutes drive to Monterey. Passes were provided to Monterey Bay Aquarium so we got to go for free which was a nice touch. Sarah and Young provided loads of recommendations for restaurants. We had a brilliant time in Pacific Grove and would go back to stay here in a heartbeat!"
5185545,91938312,2016-08-07,2930238,Vivian,"Sarah and Young are top notch AirB&B hosts.  Their home is fantastic!!!  I felt like I was staying at a 4 star hotel.  The only reason I say 4 star is because the bed wasn't made with a piece of chocolate on my pillow  upon our return home every day (only kidding).  The house is immaculate with every necessity you can think of.  The beds were very comfortable, the water pressure was great in the shower, the location was perfect.  They even have two complementary tickets to the Aquarium.  I would stay at their home again without hesitation.  "

5185545,95414730,2016-08-19,50844629,James,"Lovely peaceful place, we barely saw another soul while we were there and just moments to the seafront. We stayed for 2 nights so we could spend a day at the aquarium - 10 minute drive away, and the property included 2 adult passes, which saved us usd100 in entry tickets! Beautiful property, a lovely escape. "
5185545,96415669,2016-08-22,49070889,Sam,"This is a really super place. Much bigger than we expected and in great condition. Hosts were really helpful. Great position close to the main Monterey attractions, beaches and wildlife."

5185545,98401525,2016-08-30,50638489,Lesley,"Sarah and Young provided detailed instructions before our arrival. The property was spotless and so nicely furnished. The back yard was a tranquil retreat. The location is perfect, an easy walk to the ocean front and a pleasant walk into Monterey with an Uner back. The aquarium tickets were a wonderful addition. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the cottage to friends. "

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
Thanks Sarah and Young for sharing your beach bungalow."
5185545,102685825,2016-09-18,17112867,Karen,"Had a fantastic 4 night stay. Everything was superb, location, quality of bungalow, comfort and facilities. Even had 2 passes to the superb Monterey aquarium where we spent an entire day learning about the sea life in the bay before going on a whale watching trip the next day. Would highly recommend this accommodation, it is one of the best air b&b places we have ever stayed in worldwide."

The house has had a professional remodeling in the past, and this felt like a brand new home nestled within a very established neighborhood.  The kitchen was equipped with everything needed to cook a very nice meal.  Basically, all you have to do is get to the Grocery store and you're all set!  The neighborhood is VERY quiet, which is perfect for a nice cozy getaway.  They even provide two passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which is a $100/day value!!  We HIGHLY recommend staying here, you will not regret it in the least bit!

I would stay again if I visit Monterey next time."
5185545,109151012,2016-10-19,64578013,Claire,"Came down to Monterey with my mom and sister and stayed at Sarah & Young's place. It was a great stay in a cute neighborhood. The house was beautiful and in a great location, just a few minutes walking to the coast, and quick driving distance to the aquarium. The backyard was especially nice and very relaxing. Communication with the host was excellent, very quick response rate. I would definitely recommend staying here."

5185545,110765387,2016-10-28,91179873,Katie,"From the very first contact I had with Sarah prior to booking, Sarah made me feel welcome.  I was very impressed when the emails with details about our arrival time and house rules arrived when she said they would, and a welcoming text arrived on our arrival day to check to see if everything was ok.  Sarah made it clear that she was reachable if needed, but everything went so smoothly, there was no need. The house was exactly as pictured on the website and then some! If I had been able to rate it a 5+ or 6, I would have.  The bed was comfy, the towels fluffy, decor very nice, and little things like coasters, Kleenex, and sandals to wear in the house were available.  The backyard was also very welcoming and the neighborhood very quiet and safe.  It's an easy walk/run to the Bay, and downtown and the ocean are fairly close.  My husband and I are looking forward to staying at the Peaceful Cozy Beach Bungalow again sometime!  "
5185545,111301978,2016-10-30,53514215,Linda,My daughter and I had a great stay.  The back patio was a very lovely place to have a glass of wine and relax.  We loved the proximity to the water.  We plan to return!
5185545,112631456,2016-11-06,1964836,Jim,Great time at Sarah and Youngs place. Extremely roomy and clean!  Nice light with lots of windows in the living and dining areas.  Very good location for everything the area has to offer. Hosts were extremely responsive :-)
5185545,113035592,2016-11-09,944448,Facundo,The bungalow was very comfortable and perfectly located.  
5185545,113785985,2016-11-13,13391478,Aileen,"Lovely clean house, great kitchen space, easy walk to ocean. "
5185545,116061572,2016-11-27,93,Amy,"My family of 4 had a wonderful stay at Sarah and Young's place. Newly renovated and sparkling clean, everything we needed to cook a few meals, spacious living spaces and backyard, homey touches like a box with a selection of teas. Less than a 15 minute drive to Monterey Bay Aquarium which was a main reason for our trip. Two included guest passes to the aquarium were a $100 value and such a nice touch! A couple minutes' walk to sweeping views of the oceanfront. About a 15 minute walk to Lovers Point on the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail. We had a great time and would return for our next stay in the Monterey area. Thank you!"
5185545,116347744,2016-11-29,100564528,Aaron,"Near the ocean, it was relaxing hanging out in the back yard at night starring at the stars and hearing the ocean. The home was more spacious than I perceive from the pictures, great surprise how nice it was inside."
5185545,116688391,2016-12-02,81181233,Vincent,"What a beautiful place! And so close to many scenic areas, if you like taking photos, or just chill! It is like communication with nature! Very comfortable, and yes, very quick communication with Sarah. Thanks a lot!"
5185545,117082666,2016-12-04,7165657,Brian,Sarah's place was absolutely perfect for spending a weekend in the Monterey/Pacific Grove area. It was just a short walk down to the water to enjoy the beautiful trails. It was also easy to get into town or to head through 17 Mile Drive or down to Carmel. The passes for the Aquarium really sealed the deal. I would definitely look this place up next time I am in the area!
5185545,117347038,2016-12-06,15870532,Laraine,"What a lovely place. Quiet, clean, and a very short walk to the seaside walking path. The place was so nicely remodeled and quite comfortable for 4 people. I especially liked sitting in the sunroom. The sunroom is a great additional space,  facing the back yard, with a sofa and chairs and a round table for 4 perfect for breakfasts,"
5185545,120778428,2016-12-11,30501869,Carlos,"Excellent, cute house. Easy access to coastal walk.  Very clean.  Attentive and communicative hosts (via text and email as needed).  "
5185545,121724168,2016-12-18,37937471,Joyce LT,"Amazing AirBnB! Quiet, clean, and attention to the smallest details made it the perfect weekend getaway. I only wish I had more time to enjoy the home! "
5185545,122301111,2016-12-22,54112549,Ryan,Had a great time.  Enjoyed the proximity to the ocean.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium was awesome!  Would definitely come again.
5185545,122735238,2016-12-25,10355488,Nan,"Sarah's place was great - exactly as advertised. Everything went very smoothly:
* Host sent information in advance, very responsive, very easy check-in
* Immaculate house, very nicely decorated and supplied
* Great location - walked to the coast a couple of times
* Two aquarium passes to get in for free

One small detail is that there's some temperature variation in the house. In particular, it's colder (in winter) in the front bedroom than it is in the rest of the house. Not a big deal, the comforters were more than enough."
5185545,123785988,2016-12-30,8973229,Eunice,"This house deserves a five star rating. A perfect location- on a quiet street along with other quaint cottages- only a few blocks from the beach and within minutes to the lovely downtown area of Pacific Grove. It is also centrally located to all the major attractions in the famous area, but not as crowded as Carmel. The nightly rate make it one of the best values ! The hosts were very warm and welcoming and thoughtful in providing all the comforts of home. The furnishings are attractive and comfortable. We were surprised and pleased with how spacious this 'cottage' is as the photo appears smaller. We look forward to returning and thinking of this as one of our favorite vacation homes. "
5185545,125785950,2017-01-07,510087,Stephannie,"Very spacious, fabulous location close to the water, very clean house. Highly recommended."
5185545,127593923,2017-01-19,12040526,Glenn,"A very cozy, comfy cottage with a cute patio and great for a small family trip. Very well equipped kitchen with everything labeled. The bed and sheets were very comfortable, and we wished we didn't have to leave."
5185545,128116148,2017-01-22,87391984,Renato,"We already thanks Sarah for the quality of her property, how well equiped it is and all the details that they made in order to people can really enjoy their visir todo her house as the private done "
5185545,128812746,2017-01-27,2577778,Devon,"The area that the home is located in is beautiful. The home itself is very clean and beach. It is a hotel feel more than a super unique home as there are not a ton of personal touches. However, it was perfect for us. I only wish it was warmer so we could've enjoyed the nice backyard."
5185545,131110876,2017-02-10,5302962,Rich,"We had a great stay.  The location is perfect for walking or running every day - just a short distance to the bay and a trail along the water that extends for miles.  The house was immaculately clean and well equipped.  There are two equally nice sitting areas - the main living room and then a sunny room leading to the back patio.  We had a long stay and it was very nice to have so much space.  We definitely would stay again - the house, location and Pacific Grove are a great combination."
5185545,134722498,2017-02-28,55070643,Petra,"

The unit was incredible!!!

Every last detail was thought of..
Easy check in,
Well planed service to the customer.
Will come again next trip to the area..

If u see it is available,
Book it!"
5185545,135684695,2017-03-05,59234517,Nancy,"The bungalow is located in a quiet neighborhood with a bus across the street.  The decor is charming and there is everything you need to enjoy your stay.  Also, it is clean and well-maintained.  P.S. The ocean is just a two block walk away and your hosts have provided two passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium."
5185545,136983598,2017-03-12,857155,Stephen,"Sarah's house is an incredible find if you're looking for a relaxing trip to Monterey / Pacific Grove, perfect for a family of 4.  

Location: extremely convenient - two blocks from the beach.  Very quiet neighborhood and less than 2 miles to the Monterey Bay Aquarium

Communication:  Excellent - offered lots of help prior to arriving (as a courtesy).

House condition: don't let the exterior fool you!  It looks like a simple house from the outside but the interior is well maintained, possibly remodeled recently, with a large eating area and sitting area that leads to a peaceful backyard.  Ample, free parking.

Amenities:  clean towels, bedding, shower amenities, heater works if you need it, etc...very comfortable.
Thanks!

5185545,137492235,2017-03-15,65485751,Kirsty,This is a fantastic cottage nicer than the pictures and a walk or short drive to the beach. We stayed here with our twin girls and the really found it a home away from home. Thanks for a lovely stay we hope to be back

5185545,145527382,2017-04-18,64361063,Christina,The place was more than we could have asked for.  We only wish our stay was longer to enjoy the outdoor space.
5185545,146126323,2017-04-21,20352879,Steve,A big place for four people with a lovely sunny back patio garden and easy parkìng. 100m from the Ocean with beautiful walks in both directions along the coast. A great base to see the Monterey area from.
5185545,147620534,2017-04-27,47713719,Sean,"方便不错、位置也不错,但沟通稍有遗憾,保洁人员提前到、没敲门直接进入,亦不好通融,需要千万注意不要遗留物品,房东不在当地,处理起来大家都麻烦,其他都好,值得推荐"
5185545,148034107,2017-04-29,60812975,Ricky,"Very nice place to stay in quiet, residential neighborhood. Close to the Ocean view trail and walkable to Cannery Row"

5185545,152636086,2017-05-17,6273335,Shannon,"The place was great, and exactly as described in the listing. Checking in and out was super easy. Because everything was as described we didn't need to check in with Sarah, but they were great with info before we got there.

As others have commented, that front bedroom (with the twin beds) gets pretty chilly at night compared to the other bedroom.

I loved the location and would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in the Monterey area."
5185545,153681524,2017-05-21,2230600,Karen,"It is a wonderful location and I would absolutely return again. Tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood in Pacific Grove just minutes from coast and best walking/running path in Monterey. Walk to aquarium and downtown Pacific Grove. Comfortable bed, great kitchen for cooking, sunny (weather permitting) backyard for reading and coffee.  Highly recommend. "

The property was simply but tastefully decorated and spotless. Everything was labelled with comprehensive instructions so never struggled to find anything. Easy parking on the driveway. "
5185545,162826276,2017-06-22,28050408,Chris,Our stay and interaction with the host was great. Very clean and comfortable. The house has everything we needed. It has a very relaxing patio garden.

The majority of restaurants are 1-2 miles away so a car would be needed but we walked it one day and quite enjoyed it. Very handy place for 17 mile drive and ideally located in between Carmel and Monterey. "

5185545,179812689,2017-08-08,30616148,Kathryn,Our stay went very smoothly for the start. We received our check in information  in advance and check in with us to make sure that we have everything that we needed. The house was very clean and the neighborhood is quiet. We enjoyed having the house  close by and being able to walk along the coast. We enjoyed our stay immensely.
5185545,180503266,2017-08-10,11032898,Dan,"Good location. A long list of rules; and labels for every cupboard, drawer and light switch. A very rude cleaning lady. Remember to strip the beds (we didn't) or she'll hiss at you."
5185545,181864667,2017-08-13,119306717,Betty,"If you are looking for a great location, amazing host and really cozy place to stay - this is the place.  Awesome location, very comfortable accommodations!"

""We had a great stay. The house was clean, well stocked, and comfortable. Owners are very responsive to emails and texts, should something arise. I appreciate that! The house is about a 7-10 minute walk to the ocean, which is nice. The nearest sand beach, however, is about a mile away so commit to walking or driving if you want a sand beach for kids. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience. Thanks!"""
5185545,184906766,2017-08-20,26640981,Troy,This was a perfect place for our stay during Monterey Car Week.  Great home in a great location.  Hope to stay here again next year.
5185545,186149791,2017-08-23,76860365,Allison,"The house was very clean and felt like a well stocked hotel.  There was plenty of room for our family of four to spread out.   We enjoyed the easy walk down to the Ocean and exploring the tide pools.  Pacific Grove was a fun neighborhood with easy access to the 17 mile drive and just a short drive to the Monterey Aquarium and Wharf.  Pacific Grove had a cute main street with some really good food options. Also, having the guest passes to the Aquarium was a big plus."
5185545,187883652,2017-08-27,12847267,Janet,"We have stayed in many Airbnb's and this one rates in our top 5.  Great location, clean and orderly, lots of space, aquarium passes and a great shower too.  We were able to watch Netflix via the Kindle Fire so were not bothered by the lack of cable."
5185545,189416272,2017-09-01,129017167,Elaine,"Book this cottage if you have children,  they will love it, they get their own lounge and you may spot the deer in your front garden as we did. It is deceptively large inside and immaculately clean. Location wise you can walk to Lover's point and hire bikes and ride through Monterey or it is a few minutes drive. Pacific Grove is quieter but much prettier part and you may spot seals and pelicans on the beach. Small beach within walking distance with cafe, toilets, bike and kayak hire and posh restaurant. Downtown Pacific Grove is so pretty and great food at Red House Cafe who will make meals to suit your children if you ask. After two weeks of hotels this place was heaven. Thank you for your cosy beach cottage."
5185545,190666957,2017-09-04,26791117,Rachel,We had a wonderful girls get away and we're very happy with this bungalow! Clean with all basic necessities and a short walk to the coast line. We especially enjoyed sitting outside in the provided patio furniture. Pacific Grove is a cute town with yummy restaurants and it's super close to Monterey as well.
5185545,192032317,2017-09-09,120743168,Diana,"Sarah's place was so charming and homey!  It was very well-equipped, and in a wonderful location.  They seem to have thought of everything a guest could possibly need and provided it!"
5185545,192994770,2017-09-11,67489562,Andrea,"Sarah and Young’s place has it all. It is a nice and cozy cottage, a in beautiful setting close to the sea, where you will be able to relax and enjoy a walk overlooking the ocean, have delicious diner in nearby restaurants, take a boat to watch whales, or take the kids to Monterey Bay’s Aquarium. In addition, Sarah and Young are great hosts, very kind and helpful. I highly recommend it."
5185545,194069608,2017-09-15,46632539,Michael,"Stunning cottage just a short walk from the water, we spent 3 days in Pacific Grove and found the location just far enough away from the tourist traffic to make us feel at home, but super convenient to get to all the attractions.  Cottage exceeded expectations!  Beautiful and comfortable furnishings, we moved from outside, to sun room, to living room as the day progressed just to enjoy each room.  Beds and linens very comfortable!  Large kitchen where we could all gather to cook!  We are already looking for an opportunity to visit again soon."
5185545,197755380,2017-09-26,19068555,Alan,"Although the pictures tend to make it look a bit smaller than it is, this was a great place to stay. Well located and very comfortble. The Aquarium passes are a real plus.  Sarah's place is very open and airy and the patio is a great place to unwind after a day of sight seeing.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5185545,198823874,2017-09-30,27896180,Louise,"A lovely house in a quite neighbourhood close to many seigths Awesome with the tickets for the aquarium - we can highly recommend this place and would gladly stay there again.

Sarah was a great host and the communication was really good."
5185545,200010038,2017-10-03,35660299,Iara,"Sarah and Young´s place is great! Only one bathroom, but the shower was amazing! And the beds were extremely confortable. Very easy to check-in, and the kitchen has little labels on drawers/cabinets, so you don´t have to open everyhting untill you find what you are looking for (very thoughtful). We weren´t planning on going to the aquarium, but there are two members´ cards in the house, so we went and it was very nice, we loved to see the sea otters being fed. The house is a few blocks from the beach (we walked there to see sunset), but to go to eating places you need a car. We had dinner at Il Vecchio which was less then 5 min drive, the food there is really good. For breakfast we went a bit further, at Old Monterey´s Cafe (downton Monterey, aprox. 15 min drive), and it was wonderful."
5185545,200838331,2017-10-06,38380969,Sally,"We were impressed with many things - the location, cleanliness and prompt follow up to our questions.  We would definitely stay here again."

They had everything clearly labeled and instructions were very easy to follow for things like TV, washer/dryer, etc. Beautiful place that was very comfortable and perfect location for our trip. Aquarium passes were a great bonus! Thanks!!"
5185545,206709417,2017-10-26,17938666,Charlie,Came with two kids under 4 and it worked out great. Really appreciated having access to a washer and drier for our long stay too. Great rental.
5185545,207737378,2017-10-29,20218911,Stacey,We enjoyed Sarah's home. It is well located and very clean and comfortable. Very close to the beach and a short Uber ride to town.
5185545,208922096,2017-11-03,127181398,Juliann,Really nice home in a great area. We would come back.
5185545,209669509,2017-11-05,99761449,Yeo Jin,"This place is amazing. Just as described in the previous reviews. Quiet neighborhood but close to everywhere you want to see at Monterey. Very clean and organized inside. Modern interior, good accommodations. So satisfied!!"
5185545,213389295,2017-11-20,15123311,Susan,"Sarah's house is in a lovely quiet neighborhood just two blocks from the ocean.  The house itself was very clean and comfortable, and more spacious than I expected.  Great gas range, wonderful shower (excellent water pressure!), a well-equipped kitchen, comfy beds, and everything just as described online (wi-fi, etc.).  Sarah provides clear instructions and helpful tips for enjoying the area.  I was most surprised by the little town of Pacific Grove--I thought we'd be spending a lot of time driving back and forth from Monterey or Carmel--but there are plenty of great restaurants, a Safeway and a Trader Joe's, and cute shops right there in PG.  (The house isn't within walking distance of any businesses, and the area lacks sidewalks, but it's a quick drive.)  We happened to be there during the butterfly migration, so that was a plus!  I highly recommend Sarah's place for an easy getaway with close proximity to gorgeous coastline, hiking, and wildlife viewing.  (Bring your binoculars!)"
5185545,214882847,2017-11-26,61490726,Zack,"Great option for Pacific Grove.  Very comfortable home, all recently updated.  Kitchen is great, beds are comfortable. 2 blocks to beach and beautiful walk.  

Sarah was helpful, checked in when we got there, and very organized.  

Highly recommended!"
5185545,217108810,2017-12-07,134450739,Kathleen,"We loved the proximity to the ocean, the quiet neighborhood, and the top notch bathroom and kitchen. Having 2 sitting areas was a big plus. The hosts made it easy to enter and get oriented. The check list for leaving was very clear and helpful."
5185545,217542866,2017-12-09,155964238,Dianne,"This home is a gem! LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! My girlfriends and I came here for a girl's weekend and this home exceeded our expectations! Updated with modern amenities, meticulously clean with little personal touches made this home the perfect get away for us! We were able to walk down to the water within minutes to watch the sunrise. Sarah provided detailed instructions prior to arrival, which we so appreciated. Her tips of places to see and visit were fantastic! Also, the two free passes to the aquarium was an added bonus! So much to do in this community. The only thing I regret is not staying here longer! Thank you Sarah! Hope to stay here again soon!"
5185545,218747896,2017-12-14,159322270,Vic,"Excellent location, nice people"

5185545,223716468,2018-01-01,59268343,Christopher,Great place.  Cute and great location within easy walking distance to the beach and a good walk to Monterey.  Nice quiet neighborhood.  Everything was clean and well organized.
5185545,225233324,2018-01-05,11979750,Zhanetta,"We loved our stay at the beach cottage. We traveled with 2 adults and 2 children (6 and 1.5yo) and the space was perfect. The house is so comfortable, spacious, clean and the location can’t be beat. Loved my morning walks to the ocean and afternoon trips to the beautiful Asilomar Beach and the 17 mile drive. On the rainy day we went to the museum, the tickets were so nice to have. Many memories created and we can’t wait to come back!"
5185545,227044253,2018-01-13,65515532,Brittnie,"Sarah and Young's place was perfect. It was in a nice and quiet location, but very convenient to town. The waterfront is breathtakingly beautiful, with lovely trails for jogging and walking. We were sad to leave! I would recommend their place to anyone visiting the Monterey area. "
5185545,233696724,2018-02-10,7286595,Rodeen,"#1 bus in front leaves every hour at 30 minutes past the hour.   Goes to Monterey and will continue to Carmel and Carmel Valley.   Nice walk along the beach to the Beach House and Lovers Point.
Passion fish restaurant fabulous food. Reservations a must!"

5185545,236183992,2018-02-18,34130515,Ansook,"Safety, cleanliness, central location and quiet are essential when we travel with our young children. This home was exactly what we were looking for. Highly recommend for single or family travelers. Walkable to the beach and other attractions. Easy drive to local markets (TJs)  and restaurants. Very cozy home in a lovely, quiet neighborhood."
5185545,237147646,2018-02-21,49385867,Asha,"Absolutely gorgeous home inside and out!  You will love all that this home offers in comfort and beauty.  Everything in the home is modern and very clean but also very cozy.  The back yard is private, sunny and beautifully landscaped.  Just a quick stroll to the beach for sand play and tide pools. A great place to stay to enjoy all that Monterey has to offer!"
5185545,242411262,2018-03-11,163855103,Linbo,"A very nice and large living space, everything in kitchen is labelled and easy to find.
They also provide two guest pass to the aquarium, which is great and save us 100 bucks."
5185545,243141855,2018-03-14,3558754,Stephanie,"Sarah's place was amazing. Great location, super clean, and plenty of room. Recommendations for restaurants were great. The house was an easy walk to the beach. We had everything we needed. Will definitely stay here again."
5185545,243680516,2018-03-16,69295752,Dave,Sarah is an exceptional host and the beachside cottage a delight.
5185545,248553391,2018-03-31,53213041,Jim,Great stay
5185545,250045510,2018-04-03,51642644,Heather,"Best Airbnb I’ve stayed at. The location is perfect. We walked down to the beach to look at the tidal pools daily. It was a great place to take day trips into Big Sur. The neighborhood is quiet and calm.
The house is ultra clean. The decor is pretty and peaceful. The beds were comfortable. They have considered and supplied all the small things like a blow dryer, coffee and filters, salt and spices.
I also appreciated that there was a door key code so that I didn’t have to keep up with the house key.
It was all really great!"
5185545,250970854,2018-04-06,28155016,Molly,Lovely home in a fantastic location! Very clean and comfortable. Host was very accommodating and the aquarium passes are a nice touch we appreciated.

5185545,252477020,2018-04-10,86924322,Paula,"Great location, a beautiful and spotless home. Sarah was easy to communicate with and everything before and during our stay went very smoothly. There were 2 of us but the space could easily accommodate 4 people. Plenty of room to spread out and a great back yard area.  The kitchen is well stocked, the bed is very comfortable, the towels are fluffy! 
We can’t wait to come back!!"
5185545,254461116,2018-04-16,157598125,Molly,"4 of us stayed here for a couple of days whilst visiting family. It was a perfect place for us to stay, and when we had a problem with the oven our wonderful hosts immediately came and fixed it. Brilliant experience overall and will definitely stay again!"
5238711,39733198,2015-07-26,28485631,Vince,"Great holiday home at Monterey/ Pacific Grove. Good place for a family of 6 to 7 pax; and the location is convenient. The size of the rooms are reasonable and can see that the owner/ host have put in extra effort to make the place neat. The 4 annual passes to the aquarium is great and helpful. Washer + dryer available and other amenities are in place. The towels are clean and nice though the bed sheets needed improvements on cleaning. No car parks available but parking on both side streets are fine and worth a gamble. However, free wifi connection is poor and the cleanliness of the place needed improvement especially the small 1 bedroom and the balcony. Balcony/ outdoor area's condition is fairly poor in terms of hygiene. Security system of the place are next to none so one needs to be mindful and lock doors. 2 full size kitchen and most of the kichenware available. Overall I would give a 3 out of 5 points given it's a bit run down after 50+ years. Also few minutes walk (or 2 blocks) down to the coast line which is beautiful! 15 minutes jog to aquarium. It's an antique store down under the penthouse and people there are nice and friendly."
5238711,43219762,2015-08-18,30101498,Jason,"Had this house for 6 nights.  Used for work related to Pebble Beach for four adults.  Great location overall with next door access to downtown Pacific Grove and short stroll to the coastline.  Interiors of both locations are very nice and well designed.  

Outside terrace area of unit needs some TLC.  Pretty much an afterthought and little maintenance.

Host was easy to connect with and quick to respond on requests. 

Overall, a good experience and a place I recommend for work groups or families.  I will use it again in the future."
5238711,48861378,2015-09-29,1350203,Jesse,Kristina was very responsive and accommodating. The penthouse is beautiful! Street parking is easy. Perfect spot for our trip!
5238711,50741801,2015-10-14,11853348,Arlie,"The Oceanview Penthouse was just as I imagined and more.  It ended up being a gorgeous weekend weather-wise, and the space lit up with natural light - encouraged by all the windows and skylights throughout both units.  My party and I enjoyed a weekend of relaxation and kid-friendly activities with ease and convenience.  The two kitchens allowed for fantastic eating, as we all enjoy cooking.  Markets (be it fish or general produce) were conveniently a few minute's drive - like everything else.  A plethora of restaurants and cafes were an easy walk just outside the building and up the street.  Parking was a non-issue, and the neighborhood felt safe.  Entry was a breeze, thanks to the Host's instructions.  The two Aquarium passes provided for the suites were a generous touch.  There were only two 'issues' we ran into.  The first was it was a challenge to figure out how to turn on the TV - even with directions.  With 3 professional techs in the house, we still couldn't figure it out.  It turned out to be fine b'c it forced the kids (and adults) to occupy their time without zoning out to the tellie.  The second  involved the wifi.  Two of us had to work and needed access to wifi.  We were restricted to the island in the 2bd suite as that was where wifi was accessible.  Anywhere else in the house and connection was lost.  I also did notice others mention an issue with communication with the Host.  I ran into this as well, which caused me quite a bit of frustration and anxiety, but it sounds like this is an issue on AirBnB's end which they are trying to remedy by hosting a workshop in November that the host is attending.  Hopefully this workshop will remedy the situation so future renters don't run into the same problem."
5238711,77253779,2016-05-31,28778401,Sam,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb in Pacific Grove. Due to an issue with another property, we had booked a hotel to stay in during our trip. The host of this property had a cancellation and then worked with Airbnb to get us set up with a stay here. I can't speak highly enough for Kristina and all her hard work making this stay work out for us. On top of that, the property is beautiful. We were a short walk from the ocean, and just steps away from many restaurants and coffee shops. The property was immaculate. Kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook and the grill on the wrap around balcony was wonderful to have. Views from the house's patio were wonderful. Again, I can speak highly enough about the host and property. "
5238711,92682839,2016-08-09,7087988,Dale,"Kristina was a great host, quick to reply to any email queries.  The accommodation worked beautifully for our two families - everyone was super comfortable and the master bed was the best I've slept in away from home!  Extra nice touches with shower gel, hand soap, kitchen basics, plenty of towels, including beach towels.  Really - very nice job.  Added bonus - the Olympics had just started, and with so many TV's everyone was happy !"
5238711,102738542,2016-09-19,18759220,Srini,"This was an absolutely fabulous penthouse with views of the ocean and in the heart of the downtown shops of pacific grove.  Every detail was just as described and the house was well above expectations.  The location was ideal with walking distance to Lovers point beach  and easy access to Pebble, Monterey, Big Sur.  "
5238711,123896229,2016-12-31,73265744,Deborah,This place is fun.  It's close to everything and it's beautiful.  I'd highly recommend it.  If you're there with your family it's big enough for everyone to have their own privacy & space.
5238711,166877652,2017-07-04,134179411,Oscar,"The penthouse was perfect for our family of seven, it had everything we needed, and only a few blocks from the beach."
5238711,179008683,2017-08-06,10855646,Jessica,"Kristina went above and beyond to make us feel at home, even bringing roses to offset the fact that construction had to be scheduled during our stay! We were so grateful for her support and look forward to returning again next year."
5238711,203785812,2017-10-15,8917568,Brandon,"Kristina saved our girls weekend after we were displaced from Sonoma due to the wildfires just 2 days before we were supposed to arrive. The penthouse is beautiful and was perfect for our group of 7. Lots of room to spread out both inside and out, everything you would need in the kitchen, etc. And the location was great for walking to the ocean and to restaurants. Kristina happened to be there when we arrived and gave us a ton of great tips about the area. Thanks so much!"
5238711,222794216,2017-12-30,84005952,Sharyn,A great location and place to stay to enjoy Monterey and surrounds.  We stayed for 4 nights and that was just perfect!
5238711,241838344,2018-03-10,6491376,James,"The penthouses are warm and inviting, private and welcoming. The perspective on the area from the top is beautiful in the morning and for sunsets. Great proximity to cafes and the beach. We really enjoyed our stay there and Kristina was very helpful with everything."
5238711,252199786,2018-04-09,47640672,Kevin,"Overall, the place is great.  Kristina is very helpful and gets back to you quickly.  Amenities of the house were all there and everything we would need.  The only downside is that they had a leak in the half bathroom when it rained.  I would recommend the place, everyone loved it."
5262713,27679027,2015-03-09,622783,Emily,"We just returned from an amazing stay at John's vacation home in Pacific Grove! The home was perfect for my family of three (two adults and one toddler). It has been updated and the kitchen and bathroom are shiny and new, but there is still some great period charm that leaves the house feeling so cozy and special. It is very bright and cheery. While our baby napped inside, we sat in the back in the sun and read. We also cooked a few meals here - there was plenty of cooking gear. The neighborhood was very quiet and the location is just great for walking, jogging and seeing the sights. We walked everywhere - downtown for food and coffee, to Asilomar Beach, Lover's Point and a few other local parks. We truly enjoyed our stay in John's rental and hope to be back again soon!"
5262713,27980630,2015-03-15,618819,Cherry,"My brother in law and his wife from San Francisco met up  with my husband and I in Pacific Grove. 

The location is perfect. You have quiet and peace, while only blocks from the ocean, great restaurants, next door to Monterey, and short drive from Carmel and all its shopping, dining, hiking opportunities. 

The house was comfortable and has a beach cottage vibe while being in a residential neighborhood. It has everything you need. And while extra sleeping space is a pull out couch, it is very comfortable. (My parents have the same one from pottery barn.) The backyard is quaint, and although it is street parking, there was no problem finding space in front of the house. It is an older house, but has been updated successfully, for those who need that kind of comfort.

John was communicative and available to explain anything necessary. A phone call away! Thanks John!"
5262713,28288563,2015-03-21,27290224,Greg,Lovely and amazing. Easy walk to everything. Cute and clean - a value. 
5262713,28331433,2015-03-22,7917372,Paul,"Our experience at the PG Beach Haven was excellent! John made us feel right at home and clearly communicated with us every step of the way. The house was immaculate, parking was easy and the neighborhood was beautiful. We would definitely stay here again!"
5262713,28635514,2015-03-27,23127285,Jesús,"John was great, we connected quickly by email and text, he provided the needed info to access the cottage and made himself available. The cottage had all the necessary amenities and was spotless!!"

5262713,28838979,2015-03-30,20814762,Robert,We thoroughly enjoyed staying at John's house. It was clean and well-equipped for daily living. Would happily rent it again if in the area.
5262713,29108415,2015-04-04,278488,Trillium,"Our stay at the PG Beach Haven was lovely. Checking in and out was super easy and well organized, and there wasn't an onerous list of things that had to be done for either process. We came off a couple of bad experiences and it was so nice to renew our love of using Airbnb when traveling. The house was spotlessly clean and comfortable. The location was central to everything we wanted to do (walk along the promenade, go to Asilomar & Lover's Point, etc) but nice and quiet at night. The kitchen was well equipped in terms of nice appliances and the bathroom was really well organized to be functional and nicely stocked. The only less than perfects were very minor, and they would be that if you're sensitive to light the blinds and curtains in the bedroom don't block much light and the kitchen could use a few more things like bowls, graters, etc if you plan on doing a lot of cooking. We loved our stay, recommend it to others,  and would definitely stay there again."
5262713,29510216,2015-04-08,10398544,Ivy,"House is as advertised.  It's a small house, but just right for our family of 2 adults and 2 school-aged kids.  It's very clean and everything is new.  The street is quiet and some of the houses have quite a bit of character.  Good-sized kitchen well-stocked with all the good-quality pots, bowls, plates you need.  There is bakeware and even a blender.  Host also provided aluminum foil, cling wrap, sandwich bags and napkins.  Definitely enough for you to stay in to cook, but there are also quite a few restaurants nearby in Pac Grove or a short drive away in Monterey.  Aquarium, Fisherman's Wharf and Sunset Drive (beach) all close by.  Safeway and Trader Joe's within 5 min drive next to each other.  The house also has a good selection of DVDs to keep you and your children entertained.    

There is no drive way so you have to park on the street, and street is somewhat narrow, but we never had trouble finding a spot either in front of the house or very close by.  There is deer in the area--we spotted a few on the golf course and also at the beach.  

Host John is very responsive both during booking and our stay.  It was much much better than staying at a hotel.  We all enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend to friends.  Thanks very much!"
5262713,29746604,2015-04-12,28627604,William,"John, Your place was a joy to stay in. Our return to Pacific Grove after decades was made comfortable being in your home. The location we knew and that made it easy. The furnishings ,kitchen,bathroom were all fresh and welcoming. The spreadsheet of using the house was well done. Thank You"
5262713,30003424,2015-04-15,30921666,Daisy,"This was a very nice house to stay at: clean, bright, good appliances, good internet.  It looked just like the pictures show.

Street parking outside was not a problem.

Thanks, John!"

5262713,30531699,2015-04-23,7636635,Wilma,"One of the top three places we have ever stayed in. The place was cozy very charming, the inside was all new and very tasteful. It was a nice quiet neighborhood and close to the ocean. I can't say enough good things about this place! You were very prompt in getting back to us. Thank you for sharing your beautiful place with us!"
5262713,30769051,2015-04-27,13579972,Sharon,"Beach Haven is a lovely cottage in a quiet neighborhood a short walk fro downtown Pacific Grove.  The cottage is bright, fresh, clean, and thoughtfully appointed.  The kitchen is fully equipped and there is plenty of closet space.  
Most important, John is a thoughtful and responsive host.  He went out of his way to make our stay extra nice.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.

5262713,31218979,2015-05-03,1109660,Oisin,"Literally top 2 places I have stayed at on Airbnb and I have stayed at 20+ places so far. Amazing location and  house, couldn't ask for a better setup for a romantic getaway with the gf."
5262713,31454094,2015-05-05,11050892,Kathryn,"This house was as charming as the whole neighborhood! We had such a lovely time here. From the minute we drove up we knew we were going to like it. Comfy beds, wonderful linens and a kitchen stocked with good pots and pans. Not some leftovers from a garage sale:-). The fold out sofa was the best I've ever slept on.  Walking distance from town and a short drive to all the activities in Monterey. John had set it up so we knew exactly what to expect. Clear explanations for check-in and check-out. I'm coming back next year!"
5262713,31913469,2015-05-11,30780698,Dave,"I recently spent a weekend at PG Beach Haven and couldn't have been  more pleased! The cottage was exceptionally clean, comfortable, and well-situated for walking trips to the local amenities. John's attentive communication put us at ease and provided a convenient process for checking in and out. He offered great recommendations for cuisine (Passion Fish was a delight) and encouraged us to keep in touch for additional suggestions. We simply loved our stay and hope to have another opportunity to stay in the near future. Thanks so much, John :)"
5262713,32350781,2015-05-17,30317357,Chris,"Very quaint cottage with we just loved out stay there. It was marvelous to be able to walk to the beach,fine dining and shopping nearby! Very clean and updated with new appliances, flooring and fixtures. Neighborhood was friendly and eclectic, with many restored old homes from the 1800,s. Fun place  to be!"
5262713,32792769,2015-05-21,5540183,Kathryn,"This house was a perfect base for exploring the area.  My husband, college-aged daughter, and I were very comfortable and would have stayed longer if our travel plans had allowed.  John was prompt in answering my booking request and emailed good restaurant recommendations.

The charming cottage is small with a large bedroom, fully functional kitchen, comfortable living room/eating area, and updated bathroom.  In fact, the whole house is newly renovated from the flooring to the appliances and granite kitchen counter.  Everything is fresh and clean and tastefully decorated.  My daughter is often stuck sleeping on a sofa bed when we travel and she complains that they are uncomfortable.  Not this one--she said it felt just like a regular bed!"
5262713,33088458,2015-05-25,29451431,Len,"Lovely home and relaxing stay. The home was perfect and in a quiet neighborhood, however close enough to everything. Spent three nights comfortably, photos of the home were accurate and true. Home was clean and furniture was comfortable. 

And finally our hosts were fantastic as they accommodated us on our early check in and the communication throughout our stay was perfect. "
5262713,33531198,2015-05-29,33155349,Lauren,"Our host was incredibly welcoming. Before our arrival he sent us recommendations where to eat and what to do.   After the trip, he checked in to see how it went. 

The home is adorable. It's in a fantastic location, walkable to the ocean and to downtown PG.

Highly recommend this!"
5262713,33848410,2015-06-01,10848043,Kendrick,"The house was small but clean, and well decorated. It was only a short walk away from the beach which was great. Also, the sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable, and made for great night in with movies. We had a very enjoyable weekend. Thank you!"

Everywhere we went was no more than 10 mins away. We really liked the place and will stay again if we ever go back to Monterey. "

John is an excellent host, made everything simple and clear, and had great suggestions for restaurants that were spot on.   Everything is within walking distance from the house and the neighborhood and city is adorable.   The locals were welcoming and friendly too.   Loved our stay and will definitely stay again if we are in the area. "

The cottage is lovely with beautiful front and back gardens, and a very comfortable sofa bed. It is the cleanest rental I've ever seen!! John was a great host too!"
5262713,35571793,2015-06-20,33605673,Caspar,"The stay couldn't have been better! The house was immaculate, in a great location, and very welcoming. The host's recommendations for local food were spot-on as well. Being able to walk to the beach and to the local shopping area was a huge plus. The aquarium and fisherman's wharf were just a little further, which was perfect with the two aquarium passes in the house. Coming back after a day out was a real joy!"
5262713,35927217,2015-06-23,20498439,Ratna,"Lovely property in a quiet but accessible neighbourhood.  It was the little things that made the place a haven - sofa bed was very comfortable, dishes were very clean and new, kitchen was very well stocked (such as with a variety of organic teas) and the house has the general feel of newly remodelled.   John was very thoughtful - provided restaurant recommendations And was generally very good about keeping in touch"
5262713,36392595,2015-06-28,6154914,Michael,"John's house is located on a quiet street only a few blocks from the water and the shops in Pacific Grove.  If you are looking for a place where you can unwind for a few days, this is a great choice.  

There was plenty of street parking in front of the house.  If you like to walk, you can follow the Coastal Trail to Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  

The convertible sleeper/couch offers a lot of support---so if you need the extra bed, you won't have to draw straws with your friends to figure out who gets the sleeper.  

John sent check-in and check-out instructions before I arrived, and he also provided a list of recommended restaurants."
5262713,36817275,2015-07-01,34679851,Bonnie,We had a wonderful experience at the PG Beach Haven.  John promptly provided helpful information for our stay.  His home was exactly as described.  Very quaint and clean.  Everything we needed was there.  We would definitely recommend staying here.  Pacific Grove is a charming little town with easy access to other areas.
5262713,37738019,2015-07-10,30854441,Fredrik,"The house is really nice on the quiet Granite Street. It's really clean and  everything that you could need is in the house. When I had a question for John he answered within minutes in the app. Don't hesitate to book this house.

5262713,38495440,2015-07-16,23313048,Holly,"PG Beach Haven was absolutely fabulous!  Everything was neat, tidy and bright.  The house has lots of natural light & the outdoor spaces were charming.  The house was well equipped with everything we could possibly need for our stay -- extra pillows, blankets, flashlights, cookware, wine opener, coffee maker, even aquarium passes!  The house was kid friendly as well with games and movies.  The location couldn't be beat -- a short walk to restaurants and coffee shops as well as the beach for exploring or running along the trails.  

John was so easy to coordinate and communicate with, and he went out of his way to make our stay so wonderful.  

"
5262713,38990397,2015-07-20,26467193,Debbie,"Had a wonderful time in this very comfortable, well equipped and CLEAN cozy cottage in Pacific Grove. We highly recommend staying here! John is an excellent communicator. We hope to be back again soon!"
5262713,39612022,2015-07-25,31999674,Kate,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at PG Haven. The cottage’s name captures its feel, and that of Pacific Grove in general, perfectly. The place is airy, nicely appointed, and well stocked. The location is quiet and close to everything—in particular, the top-notch restaurant Passionfish and just a short walk down to Lovers Point with its great views, climbing rocks, a beach, and small public pool. John and Judy are meticulous, helpful hosts who thought of everything. We were charmed by Pacific Grove and if--perhaps when--we visit again would be thrilled to return to PG Haven."
5262713,39758505,2015-07-26,33618173,Fabien,"John is by the far the best host you will ever encounter.  He was thoughtful with great communication and went well above and beyond any sort of expectation for renting his place.  It was a highly personal experience and it felt like a five star resort with how attentive John was.  As for the place, the place was very clean, it was very roomy and the location was perfect!  It was a very walkable location.  In a short 5 to 10 minute walk, you had access to coffee shops and restaurants.  All in all, A+.  I highly recommend booking this place.  John will go above and beyond to make you feel like home."
5262713,40103293,2015-07-28,31176798,Diana,"We really enjoyed our stay at the pacific grove house. The house was a real delight, very organized and everything provided that we could have possibly needed. We enjoyed coffee in the garden and made many meals in the very well equipped kitchen. The location was perfect. We walked to the aquarium along the ocean.   Thanks so much for making the house so enjoyable. "
5262713,40913788,2015-08-03,34120944,Janice,"Beach Haven is an accurate name for this comfortable and nicely decorated cottage. The location is excellent for exploring Pacific Grove and walking to many restaurants and shops.  Everything you need is provided...bring a toothbrush and a few groceries and you will be set for a relaxing vacation.
The owner took the time to provide suggestions for things to do and recommended restaurants. We especially liked the $10 early bird specials at the Beach House restaurant. It was the perfect getaway!"
5262713,41640344,2015-08-08,37634447,Lei,"Our family just enjoyed a wonderful vacation at this cosy, peaceful and convenient place.

The house is at a quiet pacific neighborhood. We can walk to bakery for breakfast, walk to lover's point for Kayak or bicycling. We also enjoyed walking to the aquarium along the beautiful ocean view track.

The house is clean and bright, with everything needed for a comfortable stay.

We did not meet John in person but he still played an important role in our wonderful vacation. His suggestions on bakery and restaurants are fantastic. 

I wish we will have a chance to revisit this place again."
5262713,43019858,2015-08-17,28582138,Eric,"We enjoyed our week at PG Beach Haven.  John was very helpful, and check-in was easy and convenient.  The house is well equipped with modern appliances and lots of storage.  The neighbourhood is very quiet, close to shopping,  and parking is no problem.  We would definitely stay there again."
5262713,43383327,2015-08-19,34955389,Jeff,This house worked out perfect for our family of three.  It was very clean and well-appointed.  The pull-out bed was very comfortable.  Being close to downtown Pacific Grove was a big plus - we enjoyed walking to the ocean and for coffee in the morning and dinner at night.  We took advantage of the Aquarium passes and John was accommodating with a late check-out.  Highly recommend this house.
5262713,43784648,2015-08-22,37277633,Tom,"What a wonderful spot. The PG Beach Haven is exactly right; close to Pacific Grove downtown, a short walk to Lover's Point and a beautiful jaunt down to Cannery Row. The house was clean and had all the amenities we needed. The bathroom and kitchen are newly remodeled and very nice. Would strongly recommend for a family wanting a relaxing stay in the Monterey area. "
5262713,43943168,2015-08-23,25079090,Aaron,"The PG Beach Haven was incredible! The location was in a quiet little neighborhood but close enough to the downtown area that we could walk. The house itself was immaculate. My wife's younger sister slept on ""Most comfortable pull out couch in the world."" We were able to use the grill in the back yard and not go out to eat for once. This house was one of the best places we stayed on our trip to California.

John could not have been better. He was very communicative and sent a list of information ahead of time about Pacific Grove with places to eat, things to do, etc. 

I would highly recommend this house. "
5262713,44348148,2015-08-25,40628156,Geoff,"We had a fantastic time in Monterey and John's place was the perfect base for our short stay. 

John was a great host - everything you expect and more! He was super helpful, friendly and attentive. 

The house was perfect for us (great location; safe, friendly, peaceful and close to everything) and the attention to detail was astounding; like the information on arrival, the chocolates on the table, the shower gel, shampoo, lotion and toothbrushes. Everything was thought of to ensure we were comfortable on arrival.

All in all, our only regret was that our stay was so short lived! 





"
5262713,44538002,2015-08-27,3158703,Ryan,"What a great place to stay in PG! The house is in an excellent location, an easy walk (just a couple short blocks) from downtown and all of the restaurants. Also, an easy jaunt down to the ocean. Neighborhood is very quiet and the neighbors (that we ran into) are super friendly!"
5262713,45373645,2015-09-02,13579972,Sharon,"This was our second stay at PG Beach Haven.  As expected, the house was very clean, neat, and well-equipped.  It is a quiet neighborhood - close to downtown.  Great for walking to the Lighthouse Cafe or other stop for breakfast in the morning or along the scenic shore in the evening.

John was easy to communicate with, accommodating, and a fine host.  Would gladly stay there again.

The aquarium passes were a much appreciated addition to our visit.  Thanks again, John!
"
5262713,45936804,2015-09-07,5691113,Kristin,"This is truly a little haven. We are a family of three with a two year old, and I couldn't have  wished for better. The bungalow is super conveniently located a two minute walk from the little downtown Pacific Grove.  It was only a few more minutes to the coastal drive/path. The house is spotless and full of little comforts that make it feel like your own personal vacation home: movies, books, kitchen with basics, and a SUPER comfy sofa bed. The little back yard was great for morning coffee and evening drinks.  I'm already trying to plan a return trip. John is very detailed in his communications, and really responsive as well. "
5262713,46380706,2015-09-10,37489579,Peter,"John was a very attentive and welcoming host. He made sure that we had everything we needed as soon as we checked in.

We loved the house, the neighborhood, and the surrounding area. 
The house was clean, cozy and quiet. We took advantage of the courtyard to sit outside and read at night. It was an easy walk to the great restaurants in Pacific Grove, and also to the shoreline. John also included passes to the Monterrey Aquarium, which is fantastic. 

Hope we get back to PG sometime soon!

"
5262713,46588752,2015-09-12,30666014,Andrada,"The house was very clean and conveniently located to both the 17 mile drive and downtown Monterey. We simply parked and biked everywhere. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood and an ideal place for spending a few days in Monterey, Carmel and the 17 miles drive. John and his wife are fantastic hosts they provided a lot of recommendations and even allowed us a much appreciated late check out. Thank you to both of you"
5262713,46870223,2015-09-14,644448,Justin,"John's place is immaculately kept - everything was extremely clean and looked brand new. Check-in was easy, and they left out chocolates for us, which was a nice touch.

John made sure that we had everything need before we visited, and even left two guest passes for us to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which was great. He also suggested for us to go whale-watching based on the weather conditions, which turned out to be an excellent recommendation.

Thanks John!"
5262713,47329244,2015-09-17,44136626,Fang,John is very helpful. He provided a lot of info well before we made the trip. The house is clean and cozy. And location is great. We really enjoyed our stay.
5262713,47465466,2015-09-19,14293538,Adriano,We had a great time at this little nice house in Pacific Grove. Location is perfect close to shops and restaurants. The two aquarium tickets were a nice addition and saved us 80 dollars. I recommend it without reservations. 
5262713,47609587,2015-09-21,9421906,Carolina,"This property is amazing and John is a kind and very responsive host. My husband, 1.5 year old son, and I stayed at John's house for only a night, while we were attending a wedding. The house is super cute, meticulously clean, and very well appointed. The kitchen is great, well supplied with pots and pans. The bathroom is very nice, clean, and it has a good size bathtub. The bedroom is large, and the mattress is firm but comfortable. The Dyson fan came in handy with the hot weather. Overall, the house has great light, it's uncluttered, it's on a quiet street, and it has good vibes all around. We really wish we had stayed longer. We will definitely be back. Truly a gem."
5262713,48000144,2015-09-22,41587759,Daniel,"John is a great host. He provides thorough instructions, helpful restaurant information only local knows, and he always responds in a short time. The house is newly remodeled with new floor, new windows, new bath room, and a lot more. The house is just a short walk to Lover's point. The aquarium tickets save us ~$160. We are very happy with our stay."
5262713,48380222,2015-09-26,10087299,Kristin,This is a lovely property.  John was very accommodating and has everything clearly spelled out for you to make things easy.  The house is a nice one bedroom with all the amenities and updates.  He has clearly put time and effort in to this and considers everything from towels and pillows to granite counters and a nice bathroom.  The location is also great.  You can walk 3 to 4 blocks and be in the heart of Pacific Grove where there are lovely shops and restaurants.  Not quite as touristy and loud as Monterey which was nice.  Monterey is also within walking distance and John has passes to the aquarium which is a treat.  I would definitely stay in this location again!  Thanks John!
5262713,48541193,2015-09-27,41432802,Michael,My partner and I loved our stay at PG Beach Haven. The house was very well maintained and nicely decorated. There were no issues with anything whatsoever. The place is nestled in a tranquil neighborhood conveniently close to the main Monterey attractions. Communication with John was excellent from start to finish. I will definitely consider staying here again next time in the area. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a romantic getaway!
5262713,50274792,2015-10-11,32157857,Chris,"John and the accommodations were excellent.
I texted John various questions throughout our stay and he immediately responded.
PG Beach Haven was more than we expected.
We stayed four nights and had a rental car the entire time... I think we used it to get to and from the airport and not much else.  Two blocks from downtown.  Excellent neighborhood..... We'll be back..."
5262713,50676386,2015-10-13,40548241,Stacy,"Cozy, clean house on quiet street in Pacific Grove. Easy to park in neighborhood on the street. Quick drive to local restaurants and attractions. Host provided aquarium guest passes which was awesome. Enjoyed breakfast in the backyard. Wish we had a little more time in the area to explore. "
5262713,51122199,2015-10-18,6693958,Eric,"We had a terrific stay at John's Pacific Grove house.  The house was very comfortable and a very short walk to Lighthouse Ave. and downtown PG.  It was really perfect for what we were looking for in a long weekend getaway.  John was a fantastic host, checking in on us and ensuring we were comfortable.  We will definitely stay in this small, but cozy home again when we come to Pacific Grove."
5262713,51653876,2015-10-22,538803,Henrik,"What a luck to find such a peaceful and quiet place! It seems that the house with bedroom, livingroom, bathroom and kitchen was recently redecorated. It is tastefully furnished. The rooms are spacious and bright.
I""ve never had a better and faster communication on Airbnb as I had with John. He was very helpful with ideas and recommendations. It was absolutely not necessary to meet him personally because we had all information directly after the booking. He answered our messages very quickly and friendly.
The house is perfectly located, just a few minutes walk to the Lovers Point and restaurants and cafes. Thank John we found a very good fish restaurant and an incredible bakery! Thank you, John!
Highly recommended!"
5262713,52714716,2015-11-01,5759266,Miranda,"The PG Beach Haven is top notch!  If you are considering this property, confirm your booking!  I can say with confidence that this property and host will wow you.  My co-worker and I traveled from the east coast to Monterey for a research conference.  We decided to get a place away from the hustle and bustle of the conference hotel and I'm so glad we did.  The PG Beach Haven is incredibly clean, modern and spacious.  I was really impressed with all the 'small things' that made this place so accommodating; the host (John) has thought of everything to make you feel at home!  The neighborhood is friendly and quiet.  Within a few walking minutes are grocery stores, markets, boutique shops, coffee, restaurants, etc.  The Pacific Coast Trail is also only a few walking minutes away; this trail is a must!  You'll see all sorts of gorgeous scenery, ocean wildlife and happy locals.  The aquarium is another must!  

John is an amazing host!  He (and his wife and son) were quick to answer questions and offer suggestions before and during my stay.  John has earned the 'super host' award from airbnb for his hospitality and I can certainly understand why!  Thanks a million, John and family!  I hope to return!     "
5262713,53178249,2015-11-06,4245395,Kaya,I stayed at John's place on a trip to Carmel with my parents. We knew nothing about Pacific Grove and found this place to be a wonderful introduction. It is located in a quiet neighborhood close to local cafes and restaurants. At night you can see a million stars above you. The home itself is tastefully updated and very clean. John has a variety of toiletries in case you had forgotten anything and also provides passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Parking is on the street and we never had trouble finding a spot in front of the house. Only good things to say about this place. Thanks for your thoughtful efforts -- would definitely recommend this place!
5262713,53320944,2015-11-08,34611776,Travis,"John was a wonderful host, the house was very clean and the location was great.  We were very happy with our stay here and would come back anytime!"
5262713,53941023,2015-11-14,48676582,Sooah,"My husband and I stayed here with our nine month old daughter on a last minute getaway and John was extremely accommodating and prompt in replying to all of our inquiries. The place felt like home away from home, and didn't feel like we were staying in someone else's house. The house is charming, tastefully decorated and is stocked with all the essentials. It's centrally located and within easy walking distance to downtown and more. We would definitely stay here again."
5262713,54079876,2015-11-15,7236625,Joe,"John was an amazing host.  Great location, charming house, and very clean.  Inquiries were also answered a matter of minutes.  "

Super tidy, nice backyard and in walking distance to all sights incl. the aquarium. Communication with John was great as well. Highly recommend the stay."
5262713,55114123,2015-11-28,46249049,Margaret,"John was very responsive and most helpful with our reservation and inquiries we had along the way.  He offered great suggestions for local dining as well, which was appreciated.  The home was quite comfortable and suited us well.  Nice quite neighborhood, which is what we like when getting away from the hustle and bustle.  Loved the kitchen which was very nicely updated!  Great area for going for nice long walks.  And, the passes to the Aquarium were an added bonus.  We would definitely choose John's home to stay in again if we come down for future visits.  Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Thank you!  Margaret & Rudy"

5262713,58089852,2015-12-31,12124399,Robert,"We really enjoyed John's house, a cozy bungalow in an historic neighborhood full of charming, eclectic small homes.  It was superbly equipped with everything we needed to cook, bathe, and launder our clothes after an outdoor adventure in Big Sur.  John kindly extended our check-out time when we needed another few hours of shut-eye.  He is pro host.  

One thing to note: there are strict noise ordinances applied to this property between 10:00 pm-8:00 am.  It is a densely settled neighborhood, and the houses apparently have thin walls.  This was no trouble for us, but something to keep in mind if you're planning to listen to loud music or make a ruckus."
5262713,58357172,2016-01-02,29061588,Jennifer,This was a great stay! John also was super quick to respond to all my little questions and even was available on nye when we had questions. I would def go back! Awesome house and host!!!

We did the BBQ outside of house .. That was super great .. We really love it! And we know we definitely will come over here again ..  "
5262713,61986310,2016-02-10,51861689,Sue,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we were so totally pleased that we can hardly wait to come back.  The cottage was just as pictured on the web and fully equipped with a great modern kitchen and bath plus an extremely comfortable bed.  It is in a very quiet residential neighborhood just a few blocks from the main street of shops, restaurants, banks, grocery.  People walk and evenings are quiet making for very peaceful sleep.  There is a marvellous trail all around the edge of the peninsula and the town of Pacific Grove has mostly free parking so you can start a walk near the Aquarium (thanks for the free tickets, John) or at Lover's Point in midtown PG or all the way out to Asilomar State Beach and on to Spanish Bay.  Local food is of a very high standard and we capped our stay eating at the nationally highly rated Passionfish restaurant only 4 short blocks from the cottage.  Everything inside and outside the house is first rate and useful and John had plenty of notes about how to use AV equipment and kitchen.  A few questions like when garbage was collected were answered very promptly.  We really can't imagine anything to add to a delightful stay.  Many thanks, John!!"
5262713,62361597,2016-02-14,9491697,Ben,"John did an excellent job of welcoming my girlfriend and myself to his place by providing us with plenty of materials about things to do, places to eat and stuff to see in the neighborhood."
5262713,62617474,2016-02-15,8291197,Ashley,"The house was super clean and adorable, and a 20 minute walk from the beach/5 minute walk to restaurants. John's guide was very useful in terms of finding restaurants and things to do. John was also very communicative and helpful. Would definitely recommend!"
5262713,64130832,2016-02-29,51861689,Sue,We returned for a second time to PG Beach Haven while searching for a retirement house.  Why?  Because John is an outstanding host with everything in place in this great little Pacific Grove cottage.  He went way beyond a host's duty to check with us before accepting a new booking request for days just after our stay was to end.  Why?  Because we had asked for an extended stay the first time.  For this visit we were ready to leave on time and could confirm that the next visitors were welcome to follow us.  
5262713,64681554,2016-03-06,10684780,Kristen,"Everything about our stay at John's cottage in Pacific Grove was enjoyable. Before we even arrived, we felt welcomed through John's informative and timely communication. The cottage itself is very clean and well-equipped for your stay. My partner and I stayed for 5 nights and were very happy and comfortable. The location is amazing. A brief walk to Lovers Point which is absolutely beautiful and the perfect strip to walk/run. Also, walking distance to the many restaurants and cafes on Lighthouse Avenue. Definitely recommend this experience!  "

5262713,66223892,2016-03-20,12808139,Maria,Great little cottage in Pacific Grove! We came to town to enjoy the aquarium and this place was the perfect fit. Nice neighborhood with cute shops and restaurants. Cottage is cozy and updated just as described. Added bonus was the use of the aquarium passes. Highly recommend. 
5262713,67310818,2016-03-28,3521613,Calvin,"John is an incredible host. Honestly, he's in the top 1% of people I've ever interacted with. 

John always responded to messages within mere minutes. He helped us get discounted passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, recommended a ton of excellent restaurants, and had blazing-fast internet. He was even understanding when I mixed up the checkout time and gave us some extra time to clear out (thanks John!).

The house itself is really nice and cozy. We had no problems arriving, getting in, or finding anything there. It's minutes from the beach, and a bunch of really cute restaurants. It really couldn't be more convenient–I'd definitely stay there again."

5262713,68477374,2016-04-05,36593441,Ane And Eivind,"The beach house is lovely, with the perfect location, close to the main street and the beach. John and Judy were very easy to communicate with. They made sure the house was baby proofed since we were bringing a toddler. A baby bed and a high chair was also available in the house. John and Judy were the perfect hosts! "
5262713,68983163,2016-04-08,4869613,Sumi,"We stayed at PG Beach Haven with our son, who is 16 months old. The house was perfect for our little family. John was an extremely responsive and considerate host. Prior to arriving, I asked whether he had a Pack 'n' Play for our son. John quickly responded that he could provide one.  Then, without our requesting it, John also provided a high chair (something I forgot about and would have regretted not having) and made sure any toxic cleaning products were out of reach. So kind!  He also texted me and told me we could check in early, again, without our asking. AND he provided us with 2 free passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which we happily used. What a great host!

The house is a nice balance between being quaint and modern. Clearly an older house but in a good way - it's  very well maintained and clean. We put our son in the bedroom and we slept in the living room on the pull out couch. It was a very comfortable bed and easy to use - we even talked about buying one for our home! The kitchen is updated and well appointed with dishes, silverware, etc. The bathroom is also modern and very clean. There is a nice little back yard that is enclosed (good for the toddler) and private. We had dinner out there one night which was lovely. The neighborhood is quiet and pretty. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood or walking 5 minutes to the main drag or a nearby playground. 

This really was a comfortable home, with an attentive host, in a convenient, safe neighborhood. We will be back and I have already recommended this place to a friend! Thanks so much for your hospitality John! 
"
5262713,69603980,2016-04-11,13758920,Beryl,"Our family had a lovely stay at John's beach cottage in Pacific Grove. John was a great host and very prompt and responsive to texts upon reservation and throughout our stay.  He had wonderful and thorough suggestions about food options and activities nearby. On our day of arrival, it was raining hard and we weren't able to take our kids to the beach as planned. We asked John if it was possible to have an earlier check-in time and John was able to kindly accommodate us and arrange for us check-in earlier.   His one bedroom cottage was cozy and family friendly. The cottage is an older house which is typical of houses in that area, but the bathroom and kitchen were nicely renovated and updated.  The cottage was also well-stocked with movies and books for our kids - ages 6 and 8 yrs old, which were perfect for a rainy day inside. Our kids got a kick out of the pull-out sofa in the living room and liked watching tv on the bed (which they don't get to do at home!)  John was also able to let us know that there was a festival going on nearby that day and we were able to attend once the rain stopped. One of the major perks of John's cottage is that it is so centrally located. It's just a half a block walk to Lighthouse Ave (downtown Pacific Grove) where there are cute shops, cafes and restaurants. The cottage is also just a short 10-15 minute walk to the beach (Lover's Point Beach) which our kids loved.  The beach has a gorgeous view of the ocean and large rocks to climb if you're up for it. Overall, we had a great stay. If you're looking for a centrally located place in Pacific Grove that's close to downtown and the beach with a well-informed host, then check out John's beach cottage the next time you're in the area!"
5262713,70219717,2016-04-17,12466586,Henrike,"It was awesome. Just picture perfect. The little house is so pretty everything was super-clean and the kitchen is perfectly well equiped. In fact, literally everything was there. John is such a nice host. He is super helpful and responds within minutes whenever you contact him. He even stored the cleaning items on the upper shelves so that our baby could not reach them. Very thoughtful! We would always come back and strongly recommend this place. We especially loved the backyard and the grill - and the beautiful quiet neighbourhood. "
5262713,70633177,2016-04-19,56409584,Audny,"It is a perfect stay! From the first day we book this house, John gave us many help and advice! He gave the detail tour route and many suggestions of restaurants. The house is quiet, cozy,beautiful and well equipment. And it is to go everywhere. John is so nice to give us membership card to the wonderful aquarium so that we save 80 dollar for the ticket.I will give it a five star. Highly recommend!"
5262713,71376807,2016-04-25,39729718,Edward,My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at John's cottage in Pacific Grove!  The house is gorgeous and was well-equipped with everything we could possibly need.  We walked several times to Lovers Point and were actually able to take part in the By the Bay 3K event.  John was quite helpful and also very quick to respond to any inquires I had.  A visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium was a favorite for the kids (and my wife and I too).  I would definitely recommend visiting and staying here!  
5262713,72138739,2016-05-01,8976468,Sherry,"We loved our stay at this property.  Beautiful kitchen, everything was immaculately clean and comfortable.  It was convenient to the beach, restaurants and shopping.  "

John provided a list of great restaurants and places to visit that was very helpful AND convenient to get to. Communication was clear, passes to the Monterey Aquarium were thoughtfully offered and everything is well thought out to make our stay easy in this wonderful location. "
5262713,73541654,2016-05-08,5691113,Kristin,"Another great stay at John's place!  In addition to being a three minute walk to ""downtown"" Pacific Grove and all its shops, restaurants, and the amazing Pavel's Backerei, the house is very well equipped. Great entertainment options for a cozy night in, everything you might need in the kitchen, and even a port-a-crib and high chair. The sofa bed is truly comfortable, and everything in the house is in great working order.  Basically, we spent the weekend wishing that this was our house!"
5262713,73910249,2016-05-11,66021745,Jack,"Lovely, compact place in a fantastic location. Really thoughtful host, did everything we needed and more. A little tight for 3 adults and a toddler but would definitely stay again with 2 adults and a toddler. Aquarium a lovely walk away and we saw whales whilst walking there!"

Only 5 min walk to the Lover's point, and also a lot of directions to help us find place to eat and see. Thanks very much for John's kindly help, and for the memoriable experience. "

John was a wonderful and responsive host.  His home was equipped with everything we might need...they really seem to have thought of every detail!! He also provided us with very helpful and thoughtful suggestions for enjoying our stay.  and even surprised us with passes to the aquarium!

5262713,76349588,2016-05-26,53484607,Bill,"What a fun week. You need to spend several days here to get the total experience. The neighborhood was quiet but friendly, the house compact and homey. It was everything we hoped it would be. What a great way to relax and enjoy life. Pacific Grove is a terrific community and the sunsets were phenomenal. Even the sea otters seemed to be waving at us and welcoming. What a great personal experience John provides. Definitely a week to remember and savor.

5262713,78280327,2016-06-06,25672426,Ralph,"John did a great job preparing the entire home to us for the weekend. I really think he has a fantastic, well-situated, clean place and it was a pleasure. Would stay there again in a heart beat if were in the area again.

Ralph"
5262713,78635215,2016-06-08,3270078,Evan,"John's place was great. It is a nice little home in a quiet neighborhood; the kitchen is well layed out and equipped, with a five-burner gas range. The bed and sofa-bed are both super comfortable (and sofa-beds usually aren't). It's a great place to stay if you want to explore Monterey and the surrounding area."
5262713,78978063,2016-06-10,30570530,Chase,"Wonderful home had a great time staying here with my dad.  John is the greatest host ever, very helpful, friendly, and incredibly responsive. Highly recommend this as a place to stay."
5262713,79348747,2016-06-12,427018,Aj,John was fabulous. Super communicative and timely in his responses. Gave us thoughtful recommendations. Loved the place! 
5262713,79968202,2016-06-15,55764747,Lisa,"Wonderful, quiet neighborhood. A comfortable, cozy home on a beautiful street just a short walk away from the main street, Lighthouse Avenue. Lovely garden to sit and relax, spacious bedroom and great Wi-Fi. Just a perfect place to relax and experience the splendors of Pacific Grove."
5262713,80023285,2016-06-15,16975538,Jessi,"John's place was fantastic! We loved the neighborhood and the comfortable bed. Family friendly for little ones, the crib and high chair were a huge benefit. John's suggestions for dining made our quick stay great."
5262713,80227067,2016-06-17,77961195,Elizabeth,"This place was awesome! And totally baby friendly. It was so clean, cute and amazingly convenient. John let us use his passes for the aquarium the day we checked out and return them later on that day once we were done! Which was more than I could ask for. I would totally recommend this place to anyone I know, so worth it! "
5262713,80976971,2016-06-20,40545424,Whitney,"We had a lovely stay at John's place in Pacific Grove.  The house is clean, comfortable, and welcoming.  The house is well stocked with pots and pans, dishes, basic kitchen essentials (i.e. salt and pepper, oil spray, sugar, coffee, etc.), which make it much easier to grab some groceries so that you do not have to eat out every meal.  The neighborhood is adorable.  Definitely be ware that the houses are close together and your voice will carry, our first night we had the windows open and our conversation disturbed the neighbors (we were not yelling by any stretch).  We felt terrible, but John was very understanding.  We made sure to keep the windows closed in the evening hours after that and did not have any further issues. The aquarium passes were a major plus, and the close proximity to Lover's Point and Cannery Row was awesome.  I would definitely stay again.   "
5262713,81313655,2016-06-22,351150,Katy,"We had an excellent (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication, check-in and check-out all went smoothly. The house is lovely, spacious, clean, comfortable and served our needs well—comfortable bed, nice table and chairs for dining, indoor and outdoor spaces for reading and card playing, and easy walk to town and the water. The house is in a great neighborhood filled with cottages and gardens, and we enjoyed the quiet at night. There was also plenty of parking."
5262713,81446972,2016-06-23,9851686,Nicholas,John was very responsive and helpful. The place was comfortable and clean. Close to restaurants and the ocean.
5262713,82344349,2016-06-27,70436635,Andrés,"Excelente ubicación! Cerca del Downtown de Pacific Groove, el faro, la playa para ver el atardecer, el acuario de Monterry, etc. La casa tenía una cuna y una silla alta para bebé, algo que nos sorprendió y nos fue muy útil para nuestro bebé de 6 meses. Para nuestro hijo mayor (4 años), muy útil la colección de DVDs, libros infantiles, cuenta de Netflix, Hulu, etc. Para los adultos, HBO, Starz, literatura, etc. El barrio muy pacífico y silencioso, y la casa muy luminosa y equipada. No preocuparse por la falta de garage. Hay lugar de sobra para estacionar en la calle y la seguridad no es un problema. Lo mejor: nos dejamos dinero en efectivo y gift cards, pero John y su hijo nos hicieron saber que habían encontrado el dinero y están enviando el mismo por correo. Un gesto asombroso de su parte. Cuando volvamos a Montery, no dudaremos donde quedarnos."
5262713,82961198,2016-06-30,11050892,Kathryn,"We loved our stay at John's lovely home. So close to everything we wanted. Wonderful accommodations. Well stocked kitchen with all new working appliances. The comfiest fold out bed in the living room. A perfect choice to show off this gem of a location with my visiting cousins from Ohio. This was a return visit and I know this will be my first choice when I come back to this area again.  

Clean, comfortable, perfect location!!! Oh, and a very cute and quiet neighborhood. "
5262713,83351997,2016-07-02,23401741,Elisha,"Our stay at John's place was amazing! A friend and I stayed here last minute on 4th of July weekend to go Scuba diving the next day. He was so kind and helpful, even letting us drop off our bags early since we arrived earlier than expected. Very cute place, tidy and in a great location. There are many restrictions with noise, but I didn't feel there was anything lost since we were there for a relaxing weekend!"
5262713,84180313,2016-07-05,321542,Janice,"My host provided me with detailed information to know what to expect and what needs to be done during the stay. I was very pleased with the house. The neighborhood was very quiet which I liked the best. After the stay, I realized the house is more comfortable for two people. "
5262713,84762217,2016-07-09,20666892,Felicia,"We loved our stay at Pacific Grove Beach Haven. The house was clean and well appointed. Heaters, fans, childrens books were nice touches to add to the comfort of their guests. It was a perfect place for myself, spouse and toddler. The house is within walking distance to the beach and 1 mile or so away from the Monterrey Aquarium. There are many restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. I would not hesitate to stay here again. The neighborhood is perfect for anyone that wants some peace and quiet. "
5262713,86497869,2016-07-16,29066551,Melissa,"We loved this airbnb. This cute little house was just the right size for the two of us, and very clean, quiet and well located. The bed was super comfortable (actually, the whole place was super comfortable), the kitchen was well-equipped, and we enjoyed having breakfast out in the backyard when the sun was out. From the house it's a quick and lovely walk to the shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove and to Lovers Point; it's also an easy walk to the Aquarium. We stayed for six nights, but would have been happy staying for much longer. John was very responsive - whenever I emailed him he got back to me very promptly. "
5262713,87220681,2016-07-19,75110949,Cecilia,"The PG Beach Haven home was a delightful place to stay for our first trip to the area. The place was cute, cozy, neat, and clean.  Linens and towels were soft and plenty.  The neighborhood was quaint and quiet and within walking distance to Lover's point and several restaurants (including our favorite Passionfish). This was a great home base to explore Monterey and Carmel. We hope to visit again. "
5262713,87506962,2016-07-20,83888,Aakanksha,"Excellent place which would highly recommend! Is equipped like a service apartment vs someone's home with very clean linen; high quality cookware and appliances; and everything conveniently labelled. It is also very baby friendly and works well for a couple with a small child (a pack n play can be requested from John). The location is very close to all the main attractions, including a lovely ocean side strollable walk to the Monterrey Aquarium ( John can give you two free passes saving you $100; highly recommended--they have special activities for children of different ages including a very fun playroom for toddlers). John was very communicative and easy to work with. Also recommend the nearby Pavel Bakery for breakfast."
5262713,88125609,2016-07-23,40714585,Hallie,"This home was our only 2 night stay in a 10 day trip and we couldn't have imagined a better place for us. It was immaculate, quiet and beautiful. The perfect beach chic vibe. The couch bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in - no
springs! And our hosts left very clear instructions and wonderful suggestions at every turn. "
5262713,88188812,2016-07-23,82583934,Dushyant,"Gem of a spot. Located a few blocks from the beach in a very cozy neighborhood. Tastefully decorated and well maintained, it's perfectly for a small group looking to check out the Monteray Bay Area. Would recommend to everyone!"
5262713,89075014,2016-07-26,9908605,Artur,Great and instant contact. Everything as described. Walking distance to town and charming neighborhood. Free entrance tickets to Monterey Bay Aquarium come as additional bonus. Thanks John.
5262713,90638332,2016-08-01,11510607,Steve,"John was very responsive to every query and was anxious to make our stay as comfortable as possible. He and his wife are obviously kind people who want guests to enjoy their home. The area is very quiet, which suited us, but the 'no noise policy' after 10am is stated very frequently and could cause some people anxiety - there was even a warning about TV volume after 10!

Pacific Grove is very nice and on a beautiful coastline, but beware quite cold, foggy conditions in summer even when it is sunny just down the road."
5262713,90849292,2016-08-02,63128772,Brittany,The house was clean comfortable and cozy. We enjoyed our stay tremendously!

5262713,93909906,2016-08-14,74603397,Eric,We absolutely loved our stay in Pacific Grove!  This is such a quaint town. There was so much to see and do that was walking distance from where we stayed. We felt safe at all time of the day and night. We also appreciated the cleanliness and simplicity of the house as well. We were even able to enjoy an evening in the back yard using the fire pit. Our host John was very gracious to give us great recommendations on area restaurants to dine and let us use his passes to access the local aquarium.  This was a fantastic anniversary trip! We would love to be able to return to Pacific Grove some day in the  future.
5262713,94336890,2016-08-15,36990823,David,"Great place, great location, awesome host. Our family had a wonderful time at John's place this past weekend. Definitely worked out well for us!"
5262713,96656838,2016-08-23,28584659,Kathryn,We had the best time at this adorable little cottage in Pacific Grove. The location couldn't be beat and we loved becoming a part of the community for a brief period to get the real feel of living here. We want to come back! 
5262713,97799021,2016-08-28,8860352,Randy,"Very enjoyable stay in a cozy and welcoming cottage.  Great historic home in historic PG, close to everything.  We walked to the beach, restaurants, the Aquarium, etc.

John was particularly good in communicating with us beforehand.  He was kind enough to share the gate code so my son and I could store our bikes in the back yard, and very helpfully shared guest passes to the Aquarium.  We would definitely stay here again."
5262713,98125100,2016-08-29,42744595,Simon,"The house was great. Beautifully laid out, full of supplies, everything we could expect. John was brilliant at keeping in touch and giving us all the information we needed. Very pleased. "
5262713,99146629,2016-09-03,1615671,Danielle,We had a wonderful stay! Great location - would definitely return! Communication with John was great! Thanks 
5262713,99702415,2016-09-05,13979592,Rahim,"The location is a quiet, historic and charming part of Pacific Grove.  Several houses nearby have signs stating the year they were built - early 20th or even late 19th century.  I'm guessing that's why there isn't a garage or driveway - cars weren't common back then!

The house was just as described and was very clean.  The bathroom and kitchen looked new.  One thing I didn't expect was how cold it got at night despite it being only early September.  Luckily there were 2 heat radiators and a tower heater that helped keep the house warm.  

The house is within 5 minutes walking distance of downtown Pacific Grove where there are plenty of cafes and restaurants.  Lover's Point is also nearby.  Even the circus (it was the Labor Day weekend so it was super packed) that is the Monterrey Aquarium/Cannery Row is only about a mile away.  

John was very responsive to my questions and was also very understanding to let us check in/check out earlier.  He and Judy gave us a list of recommendation restaurants of which we tried a few and enjoyed.  I definitely recommend this house to anyone staying in the Monterey area who want to be relatively close to the action (e.g. the Aquarium) but not deal with the noise and traffic."
5262713,100306013,2016-09-08,13549188,Keng Fun,John n Judy have thought through everything so you're going to have a very comfortable and easy stay. Super  cute cottage in a great location and residential area. 
5262713,101224616,2016-09-12,88056586,Amanda,"This little house was the perfect setting for a quick getaway from the LA bustle. Very charming and cute in a great neighborhood. Everything we wanted to do for the weekend was within walking distance (Monterey Aquarium a little over a mile walk). The house itself was also wonderful.. one bed, one full bath, gorgeous kitchen for cooking with all the utensils needed, very comfortable couch in the living room. Lots of books, dvds, magazines. I can't wait to come back for another weekend here!"
5262713,102659095,2016-09-18,41661615,Liz,"Everything was perfectly described prior to our stay.  Upon arrival, everything was as we expected and more!  The cottage is clean, cosy, and in a fabulous location to explores the Monterey area.  We had a great 3 days in Pacific Grove!"
5262713,104244879,2016-09-25,91216973,Christina,"John is a fantastic host. He was very informative & gave many great recommendations of places to eat & things to do. He was also very quick in any correspondence that took place. His place is quaint & charming, we loved staying & didn't want to leave. Everything was very clean & kept in great condition. The neighborhood is nice & peaceful. We fell in love with Pacific Grove & PG Beach Haven. We are definitely looking forward to staying there again in he future. "
5262713,105185238,2016-09-30,24042540,Roy,"John and Judy’s place is as close to the Gold Standard for an Airbnb that my wife and I have experienced.  Ample furnishings include a very comfortable bed, lots of storage space, plenty of lamps and throw pillows, art and decorative items. There is a fully-equipped kitchen that has enough classy Danskware and cutlery for a party of 10. And there are many thoughtful details like night lights and even a Red Cross emergency kit. The whole place felt like a labor of love. Located in a charming neighborhood with historic houses, it’s within easy walking distance of the Aquarium, the path along the Bay as well as Asilomar with its dramatic dunes and beaches. The walk to downtown Pacific Grove offers good shopping, a variety of excellent restaurants (especially Pavel’s bakery for breakfast treats), the movie house, and a surprise find, the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History.  And one other much-appreciated detail: our hosts provide free passes for two to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We were enjoying our visit so much, we changed plans to add another night to our stay."
5262713,106180484,2016-10-04,91205429,Cynthia,John provided great directions and instructions for check in.  Lovely chocolates on the table.  Free passes to the aquarium if we had wanted to go.  Great amenities in the bathroom.  There was even a barbecue in the backyard we could have used if we had wanted.  Everything was wonderful.
5262713,107240297,2016-10-09,5715530,Nick,"John's place was great and he was great in communicating efficiently throughout the rental anytime we had questions. His place was exactly as described. Everything was clearly labeled and we felt at home during our stay. The location is great with the ability to walk to the beach, parks and restaurants"
5262713,107475504,2016-10-10,21501124,Mao,"John was an excellent host. His communication was always timely and was able to answer all my questions and fulfilled all of my requests. I was thoroughly impressed with him and the property. We had a lovely stay, this experience will keep me an Airbnb user for years to come. Great stay."
5262713,108128147,2016-10-14,3269554,David,"One of my best Airbnb stays ever. very well equipped cottage in a great location to explore everything Monterey has to offer. Good choice for those that like to walk as it is right next to downtown Pacific Grove and walkable to Cannery Row. 

I never met John face-to-face-face but he was very accommodating and responsive to our questions. Highly recommended. I hope we will have a chance to come back. "
5262713,108306727,2016-10-15,13029275,Lacey,John was incredibly responsive and helpful! We were so happy with the location and loved walking to breakfast in the morning and the beach in the afternoon. It's such a special little community and we loved spending a little time there. 
5262713,108617872,2016-10-16,63260864,Lisa,"John was very communicative and welcoming from the very start. The listing was so cozy and AMAZINGLY clean, and I mean spotless, which is something I couldn't have been more appreciative of. The location was close to everything we wanted to do. The cherry on top was being able to use John's passes to the aquarium for free! We actually got to meet John and his wife, Judy; they were so sweet and friendly. "
5262713,109591670,2016-10-22,6229145,Kim,"This was one of the more special airbnb's we've stayed in.  So comfortable and perfectly appointed.
The location is excellent--we walked everywhere and the unit is just the perfect size for the week we were there.  The kitchen is comparatively large and very easy to cook in.... and I always love when a host stocks the ""essentials"" (coffee, tea, sugar, flour, oil, a few spices).  
John's communications were timely and very useful and everything was in perfect order when we arrived.
Perhaps the best part of all was how amazingly quiet it was, despite being in a heavily populated neighborhood!  We were astonished how silent it was just about the entire time we were there!  
It's a quick walk to the butterfly grove for a quiet morning read, and you can easily walk to Asilomar, Lover's Point, and the Aquarium.  Be sure to ""discover"" Pavel's German bakery and get a chocolate croissant...on my goodness!"
5262713,109966726,2016-10-23,28076823,Jennifer,John was a wonderful host! The house was impeccably clean and there was a bowl of delicious chocolates waiting for us when we arrived. He also took the time to provide us with an extensive list of nearby restaurants and cafes. The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance of Lover's Point (10 min walk) and the Aquarium (a little over 1 mile). We would absolutely return for a stay!
5262713,110979846,2016-10-29,2403079,Neela,"John and Judy's quaint little house was ideal for experiencing Monterey. We appreciated all the thoughtful touches (dining recommendations, outdoor seating, well equipped kitchen, etc.), and his general responsiveness. Highly recommend."
5262713,111791023,2016-11-01,59208275,Beth,"Wonderful place to stay.  We really enjoyed staying at John's beach cottage. John was very easy to work with.  He responded quickly to emails, sent lots of information about the area as soon as we booked and was flexible about the check-in time. The house was attractive, very clean and comfortable with a well equipped kitchen.  We loved the location.  It is a few blocks from the coast and the town.  Pacific Grove has a lot of charm with its historic houses and main street with independent stores and restaurants.  We were even invited to a Halloween party by the woman down the block who looks after the house.  We hadn't decided to visit the Aquarium until realized that John provided passes and are very happy we did not pass it up.  It was very impressive.  The house is also right near the start of the 17 Mile Drive with its many places to stop and see incredible views.  I'd be happy to go back if we are ever in the area again."
5262713,112607854,2016-11-06,99124280,April,What a gem! Exactly as described. Superb location. Excellent communication & amenities. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Pack & Play and high chair in the house which came in handy with our little one. Guest passes to aquarium were a huge plus. Hope to return soon!
5262713,115096747,2016-11-21,19752141,Pheroze,"A wonderful place to stay while in Monterey and Pacific Grove. The location is walking distance from food, groceries, coffee shops, parks, beach, and a movie theater. Street parking is easy to find and the neighborhood is very peaceful. A quick drive to pretty much everything on the Monterey peninsula.

The house is well kept and has everything you need for a wonderful stay, including basic groceries and a full kitchen to cook meals in. Internet is fast. Great cable and streaming TV. A great little library of books and DVDs.

John is very communicative and answers any questions very quickly.

This is a fantastic place to stay in the Monterey area!"
5262713,115574383,2016-11-25,18847056,Quin,John was excellent about communicating with us before we arrived and very quick to respond when we had questions

5262713,116803215,2016-12-03,104532184,Donovan," This was a really cute little place. The host provided almost every amenity that you could think of needing,  and a few other perks that were unexpected! He made it very easy to  connect to  Wi-Fi and Roku, etc.  

 The place is decorated really cute, and the small front and back yards are really well kept up. 

 Overall it was just a really enjoyable experience to stay there, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. "

Shopping, restaurants, and parks are all within an easy walk in a very charming town. We also used the location as a base for some great hikes at Point Lobos and Pinnacles National Park.
John is a perfect host - efficient and reliable. Can't say enough good things about this great AirBnb!"
5262713,122925462,2016-12-26,5785809,Jan,"We appreciated the well supplied kitchen with coffee, tea, olive oil and butter, spices - basics we so often have to go out and purchase...just for a small need at the time.  The neighborhood is wonderful, quaint and so lovely to walk.  Restaurants are excellent and close by.  John's communication was excellent. Appreciated the historical background of this neighborhood!  Lovely place!"

5262713,123780128,2016-12-30,10331448,Jenny,"This is a wonderful place to stay for a family vacation with a little one. John is an excellent communicator. He confirmed there was a portable crib and high chair - which were a huge help. The Aquarium passes not only get you in for free -- but you skip the mighty long line! Another big bonus with a little one. The cottage is adorable and in a great location. An easy walk to great food and cute shops, the Butterfly sanctuary and the Aquarium."
5262713,124794071,2017-01-02,28191044,Sandra,"John's place is close to the nicest restaurants.  I walked to a coffee/tea shop every morning.  The most popular sights were only about 5 to 10 minute drive away.  Most importantly, John's place is well maintained, clean and had all the essential amenities.  We loved John and Judy's place and highly recommend it if you visit the area.  "
5262713,125247792,2017-01-04,76246053,Seth,"This place is outstanding!!  Very small and unique, just what we were looking for.  Shops and great restaurants were just a short walk away.

5262713,126039846,2017-01-08,15440665,Rex,"Just the right size for us! A super clean, super comfortable bungalow within a short stroll to coastal walks, & restaurants, shops & galleries on Lighthouse. It is nestled on a quiet residential street amidst the historic homes of Pacific Grove. We hope to stay there again!"
5262713,127211047,2017-01-16,1818027,Kevin,"This is an adorable house in the perfect location in Pacific Grove. Walkable to Lover's point, coffee shops, and restaurants on Lighthouse Avenue. The excellent restaurant Passionfish is just around the corner and highly recommended. John is an extremely thoughtful and communicative host who has provided tons of extra details that made our trip even more enjoyable. The decor of the apartment is extremely charming and cozy, and fits the ethos of Pacific Grove. We spent a romantic long weekend here and will definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises. "
5262713,128322722,2017-01-23,15263753,Lesley,"What a find! Perfect location, easy walk to beach & town. The home is gorgeous with a modern kitchen with brand new appliances and everything you need to feel at home. I was looking for a mini retreat and John's place was perfect.  John was easy to contact and generous in many ways, a great host. Thank you for the very best of stays!"

It was quietand comfortable and within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and the beautiful walking paths along the bay.  We would recommend this location to everyone! "
5262713,132071209,2017-02-15,3571167,Jim,"Terrific, recommended"
5262713,132400717,2017-02-17,108211610,Lisa,"John is a fantastic host and his cozy house is even better! Communication was timely, and check-in/check-out process were super simple. To sum up our stay: my 3yo daughter, upon our initial arrival, walked through the house and in every room exclaimed ""this is perfect!"" So close to great eateries, activities, and Lovers' Point. I hope I have a chance to stay at John's again!"
5262713,132920776,2017-02-19,8829413,Jennifer,"We had a great stay here. This cute home is wonderfully situated in a quiet neighborhood but close to restaurants, attractions, and more.

5262713,133166696,2017-02-20,109430633,Mary,"We stayed in John's house on the first night of our trip. The house was great, in a good location and very clean. John was a fantastic host sending us recommendations and even offering to let us check out slightly later due to the bad weather. This was a great start to our trip. "
5262713,133976515,2017-02-25,105228054,Christina Jennifer,Wow what a great host!  It is such a lovley home equipped with everything you could ever need.  From body wash to an extra phone charger in case you forgot yours.  The house is centrally located.  Parking on the street was easy.  You can walk to just about any and everything.   The views around town are breathtaking!  Thank you for all the great recommendations for restaurants and the Monterey Bay Aquarium was absolutely amazing!! Can't wait to come back again!
5262713,134309412,2017-02-26,96632902,Chloe,Our stay was wonderful. John was extremely accommodating and communicative. His place was very warm and had step by step directions with the entertainment and house layout. We also are very thankful for his bay aquarium passes. A very memorable time was spent here this weekend. We will definitely stay again! 
5262713,135356036,2017-03-04,9895093,Daniela,"We really enjoyed our stay, we are a couple with a baby and this was a perfect choice for us.

Everything is in good shape, check in was a breeze (we got in very late) and all of the instructions were clear."

5262713,148480333,2017-04-30,20610039,Rose,"One of the best AirBnB stays I have had. Wonderful location, close to shops, restaurants, tiny free libraries and the ocean. Beautiful home, just the right size with everything one could wish for. Quiet location perfect for rest and relaxation. Host communicated well prior to our stay, offering advice for restaurants and places to visit and even accommodated a special request we had. We definitely enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again in the future! Thank you! "
5262713,149311484,2017-05-03,17046562,Tim,"Great  house, perfect location, can walk to shops, places to eat and the waterfront.  John is accommodating host and Pacific Grove is less touristy than Carmel or Monterrey.   We plan to come back next year in the summer.   Neighborhood quiet and peaceful. "
5262713,149741408,2017-05-05,23814171,Susan,We enjoyed the quaintness of this home and comfortable spaces. The kitchen was outstanding and we loved sitting out in back yard. Beds better than home. This home is highly recommended.

The house is so centrally located that we walked to the lighthouse, coast line, restaurants and shops.  It made for such a fun time.  I am so happy that they opened their house and made us feel so welcome.  We hope to come again soon.  I can not say enough good things about our total experience."
5262713,152040079,2017-05-14,129659953,Chris,We couldn't have had a better stay in PG.  The owner's have thought of everything from cold filtered water in the frig to full size shampoo/conditioner/soap and lotions in the bath.  The outdoor space is very welcoming. The full size kitchen is a treat and with everything you need to make a great meal.  Highly recommend it.
5262713,152867892,2017-05-18,46889212,Adam,"Beautiful house in a beautiful neighborhood. We had a wonderful time here. Clean, well-furnished, just the right size and best of all the location.

5262713,153778657,2017-05-21,547785,Gloria,"John's place was in a great location and in a very cute, quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking. Communication and check in/checkout was a breeze with him and John was always quick to respond. The only negative thing was that there were ants in the kitchen and were hiding in the sugar dispenser (only found when I poured sugar in my coffee just to find ants in my coffee!)  I know this is totally not his fault and happens everywhere but he was quick to respond and address the problem and telling me he would have it taken care of. 
Beds were comfortable and plenty of extra towels and sheets/bedding were provided. "
5262713,154878495,2017-05-26,115058806,John,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't have been more pleased. John's lovely cottage is thoughtfully equipped, very comfortable and convenient to everything we wished to explore in the area. We enjoyed being able to walk to great restaurants, coastal hiking trails, and the tourist attractions in Monterey. The charming historic neighborhood was very peaceful and ensured a restful night's sleep. We would love to return!"
5262713,155223022,2017-05-27,9517867,Kristen,"We stayed here for one night during our trip to Monterrey. This was a beautiful home in a very cute neighborhood (friendly neighbors too) walking distance from the ocean and cute shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove. This was also a short drive to the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, which was the main reason for our stay. Besides the great location, the house was comfortable, clean, and trendy. Thanks for a great stay! "
5262713,156094997,2017-05-29,42944748,Angie,"Great location! Short distance to many restaurants and a good stroll to the coast, but away from the hustle and bustle of cannery row-- still a short drive away.  Very comfortable home,  communication was great and would stay again.  The fresh flowers were a very nice delight !!"

5262713,164300676,2017-06-26,14235732,Kyoko,"John's place is very clean, cozy, quiet, well equipped and a cute place to spend for a family trip. The place is also walkable to the beach, some shops and restaurants. We walked to a bakery to get some breakfast in the morning, to the beach to spend some time in the afternoon, and we really enjoyed those times.
The Monterey Aquarium is also close. It's about a 5 minute by driving. We took our 3 month old baby there and had a wonderful time.
John provided a crib and a high chair for our baby and we really appreciate it as well. I definitely recommend John's place for any kind of trip. 

"

5262713,166772695,2017-07-04,23274293,Stephanie,"My family and I loved the house and location. The house was charming and comfortable and had everything we needed. The location couldn't be beat - it was a quick walk to great restaurants, shops and a park and an easy drive to Asilomar beach, Carmel, and Big Sur. John was a thoughtful and communicative host and sent us restaurant recommendations ahead of time (we tried Passionfish on my birthday and Red House Cafe for July 4th brunch and both were great). The house is well stocked with quality linens, all the kitchen essentials, and nice toiletries, and is in impeccable condition.  We were also really happy with the sofa bed. Our son slept there and it was as comfortable as normal bed, which is unusual for a sofa sleeper. There was a miscommunication with the cleaner regarding our arrival day and both she and John jumped to immediately rectify the situation. We felt they went above and beyond to fix things, and we were really impressed. Overall this was a great stay and we hope to make a repeat visit."

We were traveling with our 11 year old daughter and she found the sofa bed quite comfy. The neighborhood is so peaceful and quiet, and super walkable to lots of restaurants, Lover's Point, and we even walked to the Aquarium, which was about a mile and a half away. John has thought of everything, from a full bookshelf of good reads, dvds, all the toiletries and kitchen staples you could want, plenty of blankets, heaters, etc. Hope to return in the future!"
5262713,177752998,2017-08-03,11773798,Jaclyn,This was my second visit to PG but my first time renting at this location. It was by far the better of the two. The house is in a perfect location.

John was great and communicated with us whenever we needed him. The house was spotless and very comfortable.
5262713,178512201,2017-08-05,137183616,Ariel,Lovely Victorian home with updated kitchen. Small space but with 2 adults and 2 kids we were comfortable. Very quiet neighborhood. Very cute house with everything you need to be comfortable!

5262713,198184504,2017-09-28,113864900,Louise,"We had 4 nights in this cosy cottage, in a quiet street in Pacific Grove, a very quaint place, with lovely cottages. The cottage was ideal for two people, a nice comfortable bed, plenty of storage space and very well equipped kitchen. The outside courtyard is great to catch the morning sun. Everywhere was quiet after the sun set, so we slept well. Plenty of on street parking but also within walking distance of restaurants and the main shopping street. Did some amazing trips to see whales and kayaking at Elkhorn Slough. There are sea otters off the coast at Lovers Point and on the walk to the aquarium, fantastic. We loved our stay here and would highly recommend it.
Louise and Julie. Xx"
5262713,201146933,2017-10-07,150517399,Cari,"John's home is in the perfect, historic and quaint little town of Pacific Grove in the heart of the Monterey Peninsula. There are grocery stores, restaurants, and shopping all with in either a walk or a very short drive. The neighbors are lovely and wonderful and the house couldn't be nicer. John was lightning quick with his responses. I can't imagine anyone wanting to stay somewhere else."
5262713,202093301,2017-10-09,80331606,Hardeep,"John's place was absolutely perfect as far as the amenities provided, the location and neighborhood and how accommodating John was as a host.  My wife is 8 months pregnant and it was just a short walk to all of the restaurants, coffee shops and Lover's Point where we attending a wedding.  Walking through the neighborhood was peaceful and quiet in the morning on the way to grab some coffee and tea and walk to the beach.  We really enjoyed our stay and will be looking to stay at John's place again when we plan a relaxing getaway in the future (with the new addition to the family)!"
5262713,202741465,2017-10-12,43967979,Sun Diego,"John’s place is an awesome getaway, close to all the great restaurants and places in Pacific Grove downtown, and the tourist destinations from Asilomar to Lover’s point to Canary Row and Fisherman’s Warf!

5262713,204550063,2017-10-18,150981176,Camerin,John really thought of every detail. It was the most adorable place and in the perfect location. I strongly recommend the 17 mile drive.
5262713,206304713,2017-10-24,60684383,Michael,"John and his home were amazing hosts. This is a cute home about 4 block from downtown and 6 blocks to the ocean. Typically airbnb's do not come with all the little things (soap, shampoo, coffee, etc..) and John had it all. I was very surprised!

I highly recommend this spot and will definitely come here again."

Starting with the excellent communications with John  where he answered all of my questions, it could not have been smoother. Everything about the experience was wonderful, we didn't want to leave! 
Thank you for a truly wonderful getaway in PG!"
5262713,209208124,2017-11-04,18938362,Marion,The home was clean and the kitchen was very modern and up to date. The location was central to most everything in Pacific Grove. If you like to walk this is a great place to to call home for your vacation.

It's close to town and to the beach, and the place is well-stocked with kitchen supplies, linens, etc.  The shower is great, the bed is comfortable, the place has nice natural light, parking was easy. All of the instructions were clear and John was extremely communicative every step of the way. I'd stay here again and again. A+ experience from top to bottom."

5262713,213116683,2017-11-19,158003958,Christina,"This home was great! The location was central for our stay on the coast. The home was cozy and very clean. John was a great host and provided a lot of great ideas for our time in Pacific Grove. This place is a gem—it’s nicely located, clean, and cute! Just the right size for a couple. I highly recommend staying here if your planning a trip to the Monterey area."

5262713,216412241,2017-12-03,5790233,Reed,"John was a great host, very responsive. The Beach Haven cottage is a gem. A great location in a quiet picturesque neighborhood a very short walk from the heart of Pacific Grove. We walked all day from the Beach Haven - to Asilomar State Beach, along the coastline and back through the historic cottages of PG. A great weekend spot, or longer if you have the time..."
5262713,218044143,2017-12-10,11560614,Usman,"John was a tremendous host. He was very responsive to any questions we had. The place was clean, cozy and just as described. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet. The house is walking distance to restaurants and the beach. I do recommend staying at John's place if you'll be visiting Monterey."
5262713,218950572,2017-12-15,58101027,Rafael & Lisa,Second stay! Charming! Clean!
5262713,221513729,2017-12-26,2475407,Mio,"We loved staying at this lovely cottage. The neighborhood was very quiet with friendly neighbors. The bed and pullout couch were comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook a few meals. The location can't be beat; we were able to easily visit various parks, beaches and the aquarium. We really appreciated this since we were traveling with a toddler! John was also very informative and responsive."
5262713,222088092,2017-12-28,26535467,Monica,"This house was really cute. It was located in a perfect spot to explore Pacific Grove, Monterrey, and Carmel.  I appreciated that the Check In/Check Out processes were very easy and it was easy to find parking right in front of the house. John was very responsive and was able to provide a lot of recommendations for local places to eat. I would definitely stay here again if I visit the area again."
5262713,222782055,2017-12-30,86374963,Susan,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at John's place.  We arrived, found easy street parking right in front, and didn't need to use our car for the rest of our weekend trip.  We walked to the Aquarium (30 mins) and greatly enjoyed the ocean sight seeing not 10 min walk away.  One morning I let my boyfriend sleep in while I walked to a nearby bakery, bought a couple groceries and returned with 2 coffees. All easy and accessible. The actual place was a well decorated one bedroom, perfect size for us as a couple.  I would have appreciated a couple more kitchen tools being available (a spatula for our eggs), but not a big deal.  Overall, I look forward to staying again in the future!!"
5262713,223092483,2017-12-31,93827,Lourdes,"This place is really cozy, clean, and the perfect location to all the restaurants and aquarium. Communication with John was easy and quick. We're definitely going to stay here again."

John was very easy to communicate with and he provided us with everything necessary for our stay and comfort. The house is an amazing little nook for a getaway. It is supper tidy and has cute little touches all around. Also the garden is very lovely. Totally recommend it! Also it's walking distance from a lot of local shops and the beach. Over all we had a great time!
5262713,231355014,2018-01-31,104409703,Theda,This was the perfect place for us to stay.   The beautiful cottage is in the Pacific Grove Historic District and is just one block from Lighthouse Street which has wonderful shops and restaurants.  We really loved it and would definitely stay here again.  John was a wonderful host!!

5262713,234946412,2018-02-14,62472095,Ray,"Location was perfect, quick walk to town.  House is in great condition and very comfortable.  All amenities are first rate.  Very private and the house was spotless.  Every thing one would need for a stay except groceries.  We have stayed in many motels and B&Bs in Pacific Grove....John’s House will be our first choice in the future.  It was easy to communicate with John which helped to make us feel comfortable."
5262713,236637937,2018-02-19,100280281,Linda,Charming cottage with nicely renovated bathroom and kitchen is perfect for couple or family with up to 2 small children. Great location on quiet street within walking distance of many good restaurants. Interior very clean and kitchen well provisioned for simple cooking needs. Never met our host but John was very responsive and engaging via email and text. Check-in/check-out a breeze.  A convenient and comfortable base for exploring the PG area.
5262713,239219621,2018-02-28,50251714,Регина,"Отдыхали семьей с ребёнком год и 8 месяцев.  Всё отлично. Очень уютно, чисто, есть всё необходимое и даже больше.  Стильный интерьер. В общем одно удовольствие было находиться в этом доме)"
5262713,240923972,2018-03-06,43623883,Mary,"John and Judy’s home in Pacific Grove is very comfortable, clean, and stylish. The whole cottage has been updated, especially the kitchen and bathroom. The house is on a quiet street within walking distance of the beach and all the shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove. John is very knowledgeable about activities in the area as well as the history of the area. John is very helpful should you have a question or need assistance with anything. We had a wonderful stay in John and Judy’s  home in Pacific Grove."
5262713,242924325,2018-03-13,157274550,Stephanie,"This place was clean, easy to find and had a great little neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway!"
5262713,243953173,2018-03-17,66270205,Leslie,This was our second time staying at John’s and it was just as great as the first. The house is so clean and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and the perfect place to take a deep breath and relax. We were in walking distance to shops and great restaurants. We stopped at Pavel’s bakery on our way out of town for pastries and coffee and it was amazing. We hope to return soon. I think there is no better place for a quiet getaway in Pacific grove.
5262713,245103871,2018-03-20,5624248,Rochelle,The accommodations and location were terrific! John made the reservation and check-in and check-out process simple and easy.  We especially liked the quiet of the neighborhood.
5262713,246565407,2018-03-25,18589327,Nicole,"Our stay at John’s PG Beach Haven was perfect from reservation request to check-out! John is a very attentive, helpful and friendly host, and PG Beach Haven was even better than we had imagined! The place was very spacious, clean and well-equipped with amenities. The location was also perfect for our trip, as it was within walking distance of the Aquarium, Cannery Row, and lots of beautiful walking trails."
5262713,248116422,2018-03-30,18059588,Joy,"This was a great little home in Pacific Grove with a lovely kitchen for meals that is walking distance to restaurants and attractions.  John was a very responsive host and provided excellent recommendations on activities and restaurants.  He also provided us with passes to the Aquarium, which was very much appreciated!  My daughter (6) loved the collection of kids books and movies in the house and having Netflix on the TV.  The pullout couch had a VERY comfortable bed that we found ourselves preferring to sleep on instead of the bed in the bedroom because it was so comfortable.  Would definitely recommend this place as a home away from home for two or for a small family like ours."
5262713,249170705,2018-04-01,1985465,Sabrina,"Great location, easy walking distance to restaurants and shops. Exactly as advertised. Kitchen is well equipped, with many thoughtful touches. We will stay again!"
5262713,251340610,2018-04-07,45415551,Jared,"John is an awesome host - super organized, clear about all instructions and directions, and ultra friendly and responsive.  The home is fantastic too - clean and modern on the inside and charming on the outside. There are tons of great restaurants along Lighthouse Ave within a 5 minute walk and the atmosphere is really welcoming and friendly.  We found the location to be super convenient for exploring the area - Point Lobos, Carmel, Monterey, etc. while also being much more chill than staying directly in Carmel or Monterey downtown.  Highly recommended and would definitely stay again!"
5500336,27957642,2015-03-15,8574914,Matthew,"My partner and I had a delightful stay at the little lighthouse college! The cottage has been beautifully renovated and restored. It's a one bedroom plus a big living room (with an awesome couch) and kitchen, so it's a super comfy place to stay.

The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and cookware, there are board games in the living room, and you can find shoe shining supplies if you look carefully.

Pacific Grove is beautiful. We stayed in PG because of proximity to the Big Sur and the Ventana Wilderness -- easy access to both coastal and inland hiking. But the town itself is a great place to walk by the sea, look at other beautiful homes, and go to some great restaurants.

Amy and her family were great hosts -- very responsive and thoughtful.

We'd strongly recommend a trip to the Little Lighthouse Cottage.

"
5500336,28374893,2015-03-22,9360639,Adrian,The reservation was canceled 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5500336,28533966,2015-03-25,1856801,David,"The Lighthouse Cottage was perfect.  The location, size and decor were perfect for a Pacific Grove/Monterey experience.  Easy walk to dinner in downtown Pacific Grove (the Red Cabin Cafe was great), along the coast to a picnic lunch at Lover's Point and down to the Aquarium, Mirror Maze and too many candy stores.  The owners took a great deal of care in perfecting every quaint detail - my girls loved it.  

The cottage has everything; plenty of room (although the bathroom is a little squeezed), a comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood (even though Lighthouse is a ""main"" road - there is barely any traffic on it), a frig & full, albeit small, kitchen with a few items thoughtfully stocked (most importantly, some coffee!), a code locked door (that you can personalize to your own code), a great outdoor space (currently construction/remodeling going on upstairs and outside - but within maybe 2 months they'll finish up) for morning coffee & reading or evening fire pit.  TV had tons of channels to calm the kids.  The towels are big and thirsty, the de-humidifier kept the cottage dry (places along the coast are frequently musty), the cutlery & dishes have a quality feel to them.  In general, we felt pampered.

Met the owners who are doing much of the remodeling/renovation work themselves - wonderfully kind.  The cottage's karma comes from them and their passion for their family project of renewing what was probably a funky old barn.

Highly recommend the Little Lighthouse Cottage."
5500336,28809090,2015-03-30,28578829,Judy,"All we can say is, ""WOW!""  Entering the Little Lighthouse Cottage was like stepping back in time with all the amenities we are fortunate to have in our life these days!  The Cottage is (Website hidden by Airbnb) much fun to see all the perfect little touches to make it feel like a home and not a hotel.   The bed was comfy, the towels were fluffy, excellent lighting, plenty of comfy seating in the living room (I have claimed the corner reading chair as ""mine""!), fireplace was great and thoroughly enjoyed the new fire pit and patio furniture!  

We felt so very special to find a hand-written note to welcome us and to, once again hear that we should feel free to contact any of the hosts if there were any issues or concerns that we had.  No need for that as all was perfect!

Excellent location about halfway between downtown Pacific Grove and Cannery Row, a short drive to the Point Pinos Lighthouse, the oldest one on the West Coast!  You can walk to the beach or enjoy it from the patio too!  

Looking forward to a return visit when the upstairs unit is completed and ready for rental too!  

We had a fun-filled, restful time at Little Lighthouse Cottage!

5500336,28950216,2015-04-01,25758,Linda,"Our stay in the little lighthouse cottage in Monterey was short but we enjoyed it.  The cottage is 2 units and we stayed in the first floor unit.  We really liked how the kitchen was stocked with the basics with delicious coffee in the morning!  Warm, comfortable, safe, and very clean.  Thanks! Had a great time!"
5500336,29192849,2015-04-05,17479829,Scott,"We had an fantastic time at Little Lighthouse.  It has all the amenities, and is one of the more cozy and comfortable places we've visited. The decor is done so well and the fire pit was a great way to wrap up the day.

Location could not be beat, Pacific Grove is like a step back in time. Beautiful neighborhoods full of beautiful old homes.  We spent hours walking the streets and visiting shops in the small downtown area, then went the other direction just a few blocks to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

The host family was great. Very available and very attentive.  I could tell they all really cared if we were enjoying ourselves. They were always quick to respond to messages and texts with answers to any questions.  They kept the coffee stocked and even left us a bottle of champagne to celebrate our 1st Anniversary.  

Thanks for having us, we'd love to visit again!"
5500336,31211469,2015-05-03,30565690,Darryl,"We give the charming little lighthouse six thumbs up! (there were three of us). The location, the coziness, the wonderful owners' hospitality made our trip to Pacific Grove more than we could have ever hoped for.
Thank you again for all of your tips~

5500336,33820857,2015-06-01,30023561,Ash,"We had a wonderful time at the little lighthouse, such a beautiful little spot, really enjoyed the location and peaceful atmosphere, leaving was sad...

Food highlight would have to be Hula's island grill, it was delicious and the service was amazing.  Avoid ""the great artichoke"" on cannery like the plague, awful, awful, awful...

Would definitely return."
5500336,34578315,2015-06-09,6675714,Sabrina,"Beautifully decorated, clean and relaxing home in Monterey. Our hosts were accommodating, flexible and reachable. We enjoyed our stay immensely. As mentioned in the listing, the home is situated near downtown Monterey, and walking or driving to local attractions was convenient. "
5500336,34908116,2015-06-13,16927541,Chen,The information upon arrival from the host is very informative and welcoming. The place is beautifully appointed and nicely equipped. We had an fantastic experience staying at the property. We will definitely come back if we visit the area again. 
5500336,35204377,2015-06-16,29500482,Dan,Great place.  Newly renovated and fully equipped.  It was an easy walk to the aquarium / cannery row as well as the beach and downtown Pacific Grove.   We hope to visit again.
5500336,35459519,2015-06-19,29951986,Debbie,Little Lighthouse was charming and we enjoyed our stay with our two daughters in Pacific Grove.  It was conveniently located close to everything we wanted to see in the area.   A short walk down the hill to the Ocean and Lovers Point and a nice little patio area to enjoy.  The cottage was decorated with much charm and thoughtfullness. Very comfortable bed and plenty of extra blankets everywehre. The only downside was that the people who rented the larger unit above us either checked in late or came back late (11pm or so) and were easily heard walking around not so quietly above us but that only happended a couple times for an hour or so.  I would recommend Little Lighthouse Cottage.  It was lovely as well as a good value!
5500336,36012972,2015-06-24,18880661,Aaron,"Great, cozy place. Perfectly located, easy access to beach and a short walk to the aquarium. "
5500336,36382692,2015-06-28,5738179,Carly,"We had an amazing time at the Little Lighthouse! The location is perfect - very close to the beach as well as great restaurants in both directions.  We were not planning on going, but ended up making use of the free passes to the aquarium which was a nice extra.  The place is immaculately decorated and was very clean.  "
5500336,36862715,2015-07-02,8162879,Terry,"We had a wonderful three days at Little Lighthouse Cottage. It was really relaxing and comfortable, a real home from home! The cottage was clean and cosy and the location was perfect, walking distance to all the amenities and attractions in Pacific Grove and Monterey. We really enjoyed the area and the convenience of excellent supermarkets for self catering and an amazing choice of restaurants for eating out. Our hosts were really helpful and extremely quick to respond to any questions. We would love to return and have no hesitation in recommending the Cottage."
5500336,37180532,2015-07-05,34292478,Louise,We loved every minute we spent at the Little Lighthouse Cottage. It was even more beautiful and tranquil in person! Our hosts were fabulous and available throughout our visit when we had questions. Everything is walking distance - we truly didn't need to get in the car for anything. The indoor fireplace was perfect and we LOVED the outdoor spaces. We will be staying again! Truly the perfect family vacation spot! 
5500336,38583922,2015-07-17,5715371,Frances,Beautiful house! Great furnishings and wonderful to have the firepit on a chilly night. Great access to the town and beach. Just near seals and sea lions and the aquarium which was excellent. We really enjoyed our stay at the lighthouse cottage!
5500336,39487665,2015-07-24,31390160,Michelle,"The house is in a great location - within walking distance to just about everything.  The sea front, Monterey, the town of Pacific Grove, aquarium.....(passes great, def worth a visit).

There were 3 of us for 5 nights and it was, I have to say, pretty snug.....however I anticipated that being the case.  For 2 it would be perfect or maybe a shorter time period.  The outside space is great though both at the front and back of the house.  The inside of the house is really lovely.

It has all the facilities you could want in the kitchen and we regularly had breakfast or lunch at the house . 

The only thing to be mindful of is that the top level of the house is rented out also and inevitably you hear comings and goings (and I'm sure vice versa) so if you want solicitude / peace and quiet this may not be great for you.  For busy families I don't think it's a huge issue. 

Overall a lovely place and we enjoyed our stay. "
5500336,39759695,2015-07-26,33773240,Joseph,Spotless Comfort! That's the best way I can describe the Little Lighthouse Cottage. This place was everything we hoped it would be and more. The furnishings are so cute my wife fell in love with it instantly. The bed was so comfortable and the extra bedding provided helped keep us warm. Having a blow dryer and iron ready to use was a big savior being that we were in town for a wedding. We wish we could have stayed longer and will definitely be back. 
5500336,40082781,2015-07-28,19983852,Alexei,"The Little Lighthouse was perfect for our family with two littles 5 and 2. Just the right size, and so great to able to walk/stroller to the water, aquarium, and breakfast. It's compact but efficient, and not over-decorated. The hosts were helpful and accommodating, even providing a short-term solution to a fridge that needed fixing. We plan to come back! "
5500336,40516463,2015-07-31,26259342,Branda,We loved the Little Lighthouse! Beautifully decorated and perfectly located. Well appointed with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Very short walk to the beach. We hope to come back soon!
5500336,41192018,2015-08-05,10875240,Jessica,"What can I say, the Little Lighthouse is a little piece of heaven in Pacific Grove! We had an amazing 2 night stay here and we absolutely loved the care and attention Amy and family had put into making the Little Lighthouse such a comfortable and stylish place to stay. The pictures really do not do it enough justice! The cottage is in a fantastic location, just down from the beach yet on a quiet residential street and within walking distance of Monterey. We loved Pacific Grove and there are some excellent cafés, restaurants and lovely antique shops. Amy and family were a real pleasure to deal with, they were always quick to respond to any questions and happily have me some restaurant recommendations. I would certainly recommend the cottage and would love to visit again. We didn't want to leave! The best airbnb we have ever stayed in."
5500336,41401557,2015-08-07,6785598,Adrien,Such an amazingly decorated little place. Very well situated only a few blocks from the ocean. Great evenings around the fire in the garden. Loved it. 
5500336,43019924,2015-08-17,28584659,Kathryn,Listing was accurate and the experience was so lovely! You can bet on a superb location as well as feeling well taken care of due to all the beautiful detail the owners invested into making this home special for their guests. We can't wait to return! 
5500336,43929229,2015-08-23,15526668,John,"This duplex is great. The location is in an beautiful neighborhood, filled with historic Victorian homes, close to many a coffee shop and just a couple blocks from the coast. There were nice outside spaces and the inside was charming and very clean, with a well fitted out kitchen. The owners were thoughtful and helpful -- we really enjoyed our stay."
5500336,44415815,2015-08-26,30808720,Meghan,"The Little Lighthouse is even better in person! It is just blocks away from the water, and a short walk to the aquarium, as well as downtown Pacific Grove. The house is so charming and the patio is perfect for coffee in the morning, or to relax in the evening. I recommend this location to anyone visiting the area. "
5500336,44647604,2015-08-28,16871957,Stuart,We absolutely loved the place. Exactly as described. Perfect location and so many personal touches. Even an outdoor fire pit and sitting area. 
5500336,44916053,2015-08-30,36989991,Carolyn,"Our family really enjoyed our stay at the Little Lighthouse! We loved their attention to detail and thought put in to all of the amenities and decorating. During the day, we walked just down the hill to the beach so our little one could play, and we spent both nights out in front of the fire under the cozy blankets provided. We ended up driving to Cannery Row and the aquarium cause it's a little far for young children, but it'd be a nice walk for adults. Great location, quiet neighborhood! "
5500336,45484563,2015-09-03,38041237,Luke,Easy. Painless. Beautiful. The cottage feels perfect for a getaway and it's so close to the ocean and the aquarium. I loved getting up early each morning and walking down to see the sunrise and all of the birds. It was great to just walk to the aquarium. Our experience couldn't have been better.
5500336,46389027,2015-09-10,22356450,Anna,Everything was perfect! I have never traveled to a airbnb as clean ! the location of the house is amazing! the decoration even prettier in person than in photos ! We loved having breakfast on the terrace! 
5500336,48930144,2015-09-29,43809601,Carmen,"Our hosts made us feel welcome right from the start--the house was fresh and clean, and there was a bottle of wine waiting for us on the counter. 

The house was just as it looks in the photos--gorgeous. Very well-appointed and beautifully decorated. Had a sort of rustic, beach-chic vibe :)

The neighborhood was perfect. Just a few minutes in either direction from everywhere we wanted to go. The ocean was just down the hill, downtown Pacific Grove was in one direction and Cannery Row & the Wharf were in the other direction. It was so nice to get to be a part of the neighborhood for a few days, definitely not something you get to experience when you stay in a hotel. 

The neighborhood was very quiet, and the people upstairs were mostly quiet. There was some noise, but overall it was good. Our 8 month old son slept like a baby!"
5500336,51444509,2015-10-20,6541136,Lauri,"The hosts have done a marvelous job in this jewel box of a renovation. It's a pleasure to stay here a couple of blocks from the beach and trail. Also, the passes to the Monterey Aquarium make it a fun exploration of a wonderful ""museum"" of conservation of the entire coastline. The outdoor areas that the Little Lighthouse has access to are an extension of this wonderful spot--nice for breakfast outdoors or sharing a bottle of wine on the patio. It really was a wonderful spot, in a wonderful part of the California coast."
5500336,51698794,2015-10-24,13416180,Jeffrey,"We recently stayed at the Little Lighthouse Cottage, and absolutely loved it!  The cottage is in a very pleasant area of Pacific Grove, within walking distance of the beach, the downtown shopping area, and even the Monterey Aquarium.  The cottage is furnished in a very well designed country French motif, and everything is first class.  The kitchen is well appointed, and there are numerous travel guides to read.  There are multiple TVs, electric fireplace, a beautiful patio and dining nook, and even free passes to the aquarium (a value of 40.00 per person).  The instruction notebook had clear directions for everything, and all worked flawlessly.  The hosts stopped by to chat and are friendly folks, ready to help with anything, and with a real love of the cottage and area.  We would absolutely stay at the Little Lightouse Cottage again!"
5500336,52998667,2015-11-03,46513837,Larisa,"We had everything we needed. Even more.
The place is  extremely quiet and conveniently located.
Clean and  well lighted.
Fireplace is lovely.
"
5500336,53768254,2015-11-12,786291,Melinda,"The description was accurate and the location was just perfect - we could walk in either direction and reach a fun business district in blocks (Pacific Grove or Monterey), including the restaurant Il Vecchio. The surroundings were quiet and lovely - there were so many interesting houses on our walks. The house is just two blocks from the water, and you can easily cross the slow-traffic street and enjoy a pedestrian path right by the ocean. Parking was completely easy, adjacent to the house. And it was such a luxury to grab the aquarium passes, leave the car behind, and walk right in past the line in only ten minutes' time. We had an excellent time in the place itself - cosy, had everything we needed, a generous supply of blankets for time on the couch. The bed was a bit soft for our tastes - since we like a hard mattress - but we imagine that most will find it perfectly comfortable. Thank you for a great stay!"
5500336,55386548,2015-12-01,30809090,Siddhartha,"This one is a gem!! Very conveniently located at walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove and also the beautiful coast. The neighborhood was quiet and very safe. The cottage itself was an absolute delight. Done up very tastefully with every convenience thought of. While we enjoyed the travels around the area (Big Sur, Carmel etc.) we couldn't wait to come back at the end of the day to this cozy haven. The evenings got chilly, but we were still able to enjoy the beautiful patio by the fire pit - great find - we will definitely be back here in a heartbeat!"
5500336,55788151,2015-12-06,9692465,Sam,"Our host was really great. We had a light bulb problem in the little lighthouse (ground level) so they upgraded us upstairs to the lighthouse cottage. That was a very cute and very (very) well decorated place. Also ideally located in Pacific Grove.
My parents and myself are very thankful and had a marvelous time here. Highly recommended!"
5500336,56055806,2015-12-08,19544360,Dena,The listing was very accurate. It is a warm cozy little cottage. The decor was very nice. It is located very close to ocean. You can hear the waves crashing on the rocks. It is an easy walk to downtown Pacific Grove where there are many cute shops and quaint restaurants. I would stay there again. If I can get a free date. It is becoming quite popular. 
5500336,58612536,2016-01-03,16102504,Horatiu,"The good: The cottage is just as described in a wonderful location. We were within walking distance to many attractions (including the aquarium) and a trail along the coast. It was wonderfully decorated and very clean with all necessary amenities provided. There was also a bottle of wine waiting for us as we arrived which was a nice touch. The hosts were very communicative regarding the stay which made arriving and leaving a breeze.

The bad: As mentioned in the listing, noises from the upstairs cottage are audible in the downstairs cottage where we stayed. I suppose it's luck who your neighbors happen to be during your stay but unfortunately for us, there was an entire family with several small children and a baby so every early morning, there would be constant running around and crying that would last hours."
5500336,58779331,2016-01-05,43118931,Silke,Wonderful place. Thanks for a great stay
5500336,60544693,2016-01-24,19989055,Nicholas,"We felt very welcome, like we were in our own little home."
5500336,61823783,2016-02-08,11801121,Carrie,"We had a fantastic time staying at the Little Lighthouse!! It is perfectly decorated with style, and gives a warm cozy feeling!! The location is ideal for easy walking into the main areas of interest and exploring, not to mention just a few blocks from the coastline. We would most definitely love to visit again!! Thank you!!"
5500336,62492170,2016-02-15,48867161,Sean,Listing was accurate and terrific hosts.  They were very responsive and were clear about everything well in advance.  Highly recommend.
5500336,62848666,2016-02-17,623214,Mollie,"Just as advertised. A clean and cozy cottage nested underneath the upstairs unit. Great location - easy walk to the aquarium, a Nob Hill grocery store, good coffee, a nice walking path/rocky beach and more. The patio/yard is comfortable and relaxing. The hosts left a bottle of wine which was nice and there is a french press and tea kettle for making your own coffee. The option to use the aquarium passes was great!"
5500336,62964391,2016-02-19,6382500,Alex,The hosts are such lovely people you need to only speak to them to feel their warmth. They were quick to respond to queries and always made me feel that they were ready to help if necessary. The house is perhaps the most thought-out Airbnb rental ever. Every you would need is there (save for a washing machine and dryer). The utensils and plates were immaculately clean... Its's unbelievable! It was really such a lovely home at Monterey and I can't wait to return!
5500336,66217352,2016-03-20,59565885,Adam,"Wonderful home in a beautiful area. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome, comfortable and safe. Owners communicated really well, and welcomed us with a note and a lovely bottle of wine! House was spotless, comfortable, incredibly tasteful and inspiring. Everything about the house and area was gorgeous and you couldn't get a better location, with the seafront a minute away and the quirky houses and shops of Pacific Grove on the doorstep. We are already planning our next trip!"
5500336,68123891,2016-04-02,59793094,Nick,The description and the information provided was first rate. We liked all the little touches provided by the hosts and the location is perfect. Great shower and everything you need in the kitchen. We took advantage of the aquarium passes which is recommended and a whale watching trip with go whales. We had an early evening supper at Lovers point where the main courses were $10 if seated before 5.30pm. This was very popular with locals also. 
5500336,68311326,2016-04-04,51209693,Paul,"Fantastic location and charming, well equipped beach cottage. Perfect combination of quiet area close to beach, aquarium and central Pacific grove. Thanks for a great stay "

We loved the little garden. We will definitely recommend this place to friends. Thank u for our welcome bottle of wine and the aquarium passes! "
5500336,72225805,2016-05-01,40021255,Alyssa,"We had a lovely time in Little Lighthouse!  The accommodations were so cute and perfect for our visit in Pacific Grove.  Coincidentally, our friend lived just a block from this house, so it was the perfect location!  I appreciated the coffee and the book of menus and information very much!"
5500336,72772586,2016-05-04,9451803,David,This place was absolutely beautiful and situated in an ideal location.  The stay was extremely pleasant and the house had all the amenities of home and more.  Thank you!!
5500336,73950826,2016-05-11,29093954,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful time at this adorable Pacific Grove home! The home has so much character and charm and was exactly what we were looking for. We felt so welcome and comfortable and enjoyed all the extra touches...like warm outdoor blankets near the fire pit, and a complimentary bottle of wine. "
5500336,74535662,2016-05-15,61306341,Craig,"The little lighthouse cottage was a great place to stay with our family.  We were out for a wedding and it provided a comfort for our family.  We enjoy the time there and the hosts were great.  They were easy to get a hold of and were respectful.  

We also got to go to enjoy the Monterey Bay Aquarium using our hosts member passes. Sweet!"
5500336,76298634,2016-05-26,45216127,Laura,"It will be hard to top this Airbnb! The house was beautiful and clean. It was exactly as described, if not a bit better. It had everything we needed for a week-long stay. The neighborhood was extremely safe and a quick and easy walk to the beach and Cannery Row area. The hosts answered any question we had within minutes. The hosts did a fantastic job with this place. We felt very welcome!"
5500336,78157791,2016-06-05,68598206,Vivienne,The cottage was very welcoming. The location was fantastic. The hosts arranged early check-in for us which allowed us to use the aquarium  passes on the first afternoon.
5500336,79458256,2016-06-12,65660746,Rachel,What a lovely place to stay! The pictures don't do it justice. Very clean and well thought out. You're a 10 minute walk from the aquarium and Cannery Row or 10 minutes in the other direction and you're in Downtown Pacific Grove. We will back to stay again.
5500336,82095615,2016-06-26,25062144,Margaux,"Super logement, très cosy, quoique un peu petit pour 4 personnes.
Nous avons passé un très bon moment et nous avons bien pu profité de la mer à deux pas de la maison.
Très bonne adresse!"
5500336,82860845,2016-06-29,27188831,Bradley,Great location!  As advertised! Few blocks from all the Monterey attractions!
5500336,83400226,2016-07-02,8279250,Lynne,"My mom and I had such a wonderful time at the Little Lighthouse. The apartment is adorable, clean, and instantly homey. Our hosts were quick to respond to my questions and had a binder full of tips for both the house and the area. The location is unbeatable, just a two block walk to a bike path along the ocean! The aquarium passes were a fabulous bonus. Would definitely stay there again. (Note: I slept on the pull out couch and was perfectly comfortable!) "
5500336,84908378,2016-07-09,27841442,Mélissa,We had a great Time in Pacific Grove and that house was beautiful and clean. Thank you for everything.
5500336,85439874,2016-07-11,82496577,Cyrus,This place is perfect for a small family. The aquarium is only a few blocks away and you have everything you need to have a home away from home. Amy was quick to respond to questions. Please drive slowly near the area as we unfortunately saw a deer being cared for in the middle of the street. 
5500336,86779265,2016-07-17,42863684,Gay,"The lighthouse cottages are a wonderful place for a family gathering. We rented both lighthouse and little light house cottages for our family of six adults and five grandchildren ages 9 months, two, seven, nine and eleven. There was plenty of space for everyone and everything. The granddaughters especially enjoyed the sweet little alcove tucked under the eves off the staircase in lighthouse cottage. It was Perfect for daytime play and nighttime sleep. We loved being within walking distance of so many adventures including the beaches, aquarium( thank you for the passes!) and Starbucks!  The fireplaces and out door patios were also much appreciated.  Amy could not have been more gracious and responsive both before and during our stay. We highly recommend the lighthouse cottages.  The careful attention to detail in both decor and amenities will make you feel welcomed and immediately at home. "
5500336,87581930,2016-07-20,16927060,Kelly,"Out experience at Little Lighthouse was fantastic.  The cottage is just as described, and though it is small, it is perfect for a couple, or even three people.  We had our one year old baby with us and the hosts graciously provided a pack and play for her to sleep in.  The location is PERFECT and we enjoyed walking into town each morning to try one of the many coffee shops and breakfast spots.  We also loved using the aquarium passes, as did our little one!  The hosts were also extremely quick in getting back to me with any issues I had. Furthermore, when I let them know that I had left something behind, they volunteered to mail it to me.  Overall, this was a great experience and I would recommend staying at Little Lighthouse to anyone visiting the Monterey/Pacific Grove area!"
5500336,87981990,2016-07-22,12520462,Sara,"This place is absolutely adorable! It is so beautifully decorated and makes you feel at home as soon as you walk in. The location is great with walking distance to the aquarium, and from there a simple trolley ride into Monterey. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back should we ever visit again. Thank you! "
5500336,89489981,2016-07-28,65528784,Tim,"We loved staying at Little Lighthouse. It was charming, sparkling clean,  well appointed with every convenience, and beautifully situated in the quiet and peaceful township of Pacific Grove. It is just two blocks away from a stunning coastline walk and a 10-15 minute stroll from Cannery Row. It's the sort of place one could stay for months on end, if only vacation time could be blissfully extended. A very comfortable and rejuvenating stay. Highly recommended."
5500336,90942306,2016-08-03,75298935,Alan,"The place was beautifully decorated and super clean. We also loved the location. The hosts were very good at communicating yet we felt we had the place to ourselves without feeling like guests.
The tickets for the aquarium were a real bonus and we enjoyed our day there.
It's such a beautiful place to visit."
5500336,91502567,2016-08-05,32766736,Annette,"Das Cottage ist sehr süß, gut ausgestattet und gut gelegen. Man kann das Aquarium zu Fuß erreichen und es gibt 2 Eintrittspässe in der Unterkunft mit denen man das Aquarium kostenlos besuchen kann. Wir empfehlen sehr Pavel's Bäckerei in Pacific Grove. Die untere Etage ist etwas hellhörig, aber ich würde jederzeit wiederkommen. Ein herzliches Dankeschön an die Gastgeber!!! "
5500336,94749044,2016-08-16,25909272,Rebecca,"Beautiful house full of lovely, interesting antiques. Great porch for breakfast and they kindly left us a very good bottle of wine. The Monterey Aquarium was amazing and with the added bonus of the two free passes, made it excellent value."
5500336,97513582,2016-08-27,5811295,Chris,"Very nice downstairs apartment in a lovely convenient location handy for both Pacific Grove and Monterey. The apartment is very stylish and comfortable, although small, and the front yard is a very nice place to sit and spend a bit of time."
5500336,98128973,2016-08-29,4445128,Jason,"Great place to stay!  Close to everything.  Very clean and cozy.  Loved the decor, privacy and outside firepit area.  Would recommend to everyone!"

The use of the Aquarium passes saved us a lot of money and were a thoughtful addition to the property let.

Communication was quick, clear and accurate throughout. We highly recommend this property."
5500336,99160144,2016-09-03,78621787,Will,Noisy upstairs renters were the only problem. All else was lovely.

5500336,108610672,2016-10-16,6817638,Sarah,"We loved our stay here! The location is fantastic--easily walkable to lots of sights and restaurants, and just a couple blocks from the restaurant. The apartment is very comfortable and relatively spacious. (Our friend who slept on the sofa bed said it was great!) The arrival instructions also made it extremely easy to get into the apartment. We would highly recommend staying here!"
5500336,113981474,2016-11-14,37255753,Jamie,"Little Light House was amazing! From the minute we walked in we were in love with everything about the cottage! In addition to the impeccable cleanliness we could not have been more happy with how cozy it was. The master bed was super comfy as well as the pull out couch (which is not always easy to find). The cottage had everything we needed right down to the zip lock bags in the kitchen cabinet. We loved the way it was decorated, kitchen was well equipped. For us the location was great, good home base for exploring the amazing views of the coast. We had every intention of utilizing the great fire pit area outside but just weren't able to find the time, great outdoor furniture complete with cushions and blankets if we so desired. The French Press coffee and bottle of wine really expressed the graciousness of our hosts, they thought of everything! Check in couldn't have been easier with the lock-box on the door. We would absolutely recommend Little Lighthouse to anyone interested. We were sad to leave and look forward to coming back some day!"
5500336,122735531,2016-12-25,58266357,Luis Eduardo,"Best decision in this trip. The best location you can get in Monterey, everything is a walking distance with beautiful views.

Place is cozy and quiet. Just what we were looking for on Christmas Eve. We will definitely come back again! 

Thanks for everything."
5500336,123509230,2016-12-29,18486750,Dan,We had a great two-day stay at Little Lighthouse. Convenient location and had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend and hope to be back soon!

5500336,139128852,2017-03-23,112686448,Alex,"What a great house!  While we have visited Monterey before, we had always stayed in hotels.  This house was so comfy, and the location is absolutely amazing.  We barely drove while we were there.  Pacific Grove is an awesome little city and the downtown is only a short walk down Lighthouse Ave.  In addition, you are only 2-3 blocks from the ocean and the coastal trail to the aquarium and the Lovers Point beach.  Family of 4 with two kids under 12, and this house was perfect for our stay of 3 nights.  We will definitely stay at the little lighthouse again! "

5500336,142893678,2017-04-09,6707245,Will,"I highly recommend Little Lighthouse for anyone coming to Monterey/Pacific Grove as a couple. The unit is charming -  lovingly furnished & decorated, more than the average vacation rental. It's more spacious than the photos suggest - very comfortable for a couple. The bed is unbelievably comfortable. There's a nice outdoor sitting area too, with a fire pit and lovely plants and trees. The bay is visible just a couple blocks down the hill, it's a nice short walk to the aquarium and to downtown Pacific Grove. And the owners are friendly, helpful and organized. Great option all around! "
5500336,144399700,2017-04-15,53571694,Ingrid,"Great location, beautiful decor, easy check in/out. Even pull out sofa bed was really comfortable!"
5500336,145713075,2017-04-19,6816118,Caitlin,"We loved our stay and would come back to the area in a heartbeat! The location was perfect--we could walk to the aquarium (and use the house's free passes) and everything Monterey has to offer. The house is 2 blocks from the water and we enjoyed many beautiful walks to see the famous seals and otters and whales. The house is also a quick 15-20 minute drive from the amazing restaurants and beaches in Carmel by the sea. While there wasn't a good dinner table indoors, the outside patio was lovely including the fire pit and table. If the weather is good, the apartment is perfect. "
5500336,146398005,2017-04-22,124898693,Michael,Everything was exactly as they described. Very cozy cottage close to the beach. Great stay in a beautiful location.
5500336,147033655,2017-04-24,65094833,Lisa,"Definitely a hidden gem in this area of California. You can be as busy as you would like or stay close and relax in this very modernly updated ""old world"" carriage house. Drinking the tasty Pinot Noir waiting for us from the vintage glasses, to sitting wrapped in the softest blankets  by the patio fire pit, and then riding our bikes all over the town, made for the perfect mini vacation. "
5500336,147411964,2017-04-26,73522074,Jessica,This place was lovely! A short walk from the beach and such a cute space. The aquarium passes were awesome and Amy was very helpful when we had a question. It was a great stay! 
5500336,147824025,2017-04-28,19032055,Katie,"The Little Lighthouse was the perfect accommodation for me.  I was driving up the PCH by myself and wanted to spend a couple nights in Monterey. This little apartment was exactly as depicted, near town, and very convenient. Check in was seamless, and completely on my own time (they had a keypad lock).  All in all, I would highly recommend this spot! "
5500336,148873793,2017-05-01,109545011,Sarah,Cute little cottage with magazine quality decorating. Very walkable and quick to Cannery Row. 
5500336,150289130,2017-05-07,4789060,Katie,This place made for a great weekend in Pacific Grove! Check in and using the aquarium passes were both a breeze. We appreciated the well stocked kitchen and enjoyed walking to various sites from the house.
5500336,150880951,2017-05-09,52099376,Rachel,"This apartment exceeded expectations- super comfy bed and pillows , well equipped kitchen, nice living room with electric fireplace if there's a chill , outside table and chairs , and free passes to the aquarium ( within walking distance) Pacific Grove was a perfect location to tour the area - Point Lobos Park is stunning and nearby among many other attractions- "
5500336,152505628,2017-05-16,1857457,Sarah,The little lighthouse is a gorgeous and cozy place perfect for two people (and a baby). It had everything we needed for our stay and was good walking distance to the ocean and restaurants. Amy and her family have done a good job making it feel homey! 
5500336,152870350,2017-05-18,34535516,Adam,"This home is very lovely, and in a perfect location to explore Pacific Grove, Monterey and Carmel. Wonderful stay in a very comfortable and beautifully decorated cottage. The hosts were very helpful and responsive. Thank you!"
5500336,157401906,2017-06-03,25872064,Morgan,"We stayed here for two nights and it was perfect (albeit cozy) for our family (2 adults, 2 small children).  They have made great use of a small space and really maximized the layout. Lots of natural light, seating for 4 at a kitchen table, outdoor dining and lounging options, all the basics you would need out of the kitchen and a TV in both the living room and bedroom. And the decor and furnishings! So thoughtfully and tastefully decorated in a way that maintains the historical significance of the home while proving guests maximum comfort. We optimized our two days in Pacific Grove: aquarium with the kiddos, bike ride (with trailer) along the coastal path, beverages with an ocean view at Spanish Bay, lunch with the harbor seals (and tourists) at the pier in Monterrey, and cozy walks into town to pick up groceries for home cooked meals. 

My only heads up comments to future guests: There is a unit upstairs and we did frequently hear footsteps on the floor. We never heard voices (and we know they also had a couple of young kids) and we are up early anyway, so overall the noise wasn't an issue for us. Also, the photos show a fire pit in the front courtyard, but it is no longer functional. We were a bit bummed out by this (it seems to be a recent development based on notes in the guest book, so perhaps it's being repaired), but the fireplace inside provided ample comfort and ambiance. "
5500336,158191071,2017-06-05,30151782,Gretchen,Lovely apartment close to beach and shops/restaurants. Check out the coffee shop and Beatles themes ice cream shop down the street. Great outdoor seating for dining and relaxing with lovely lights on the patio. Fully equipped kitchen made cooking easy. Aquarium guest passes we a great bonus!  Perfect place to explore the area!
5500336,160154731,2017-06-12,7584450,Maydah,Such a great place! Very close to everywhere. Highly recommended. Very clean and homely. We even got to see a deer on our street early afternoon! 
5500336,161381071,2017-06-17,55587484,Casey,"We spent two nights at the Little Lighthouse during our two week California trip. This cottage was so charming and in a beautiful location. We absolutely loved all of the character in the house and it was clear that a lot of thought had been put into every detail. The kitchen was beautiful, although we didn't have much time to use it. We also loved sitting on the patio and exploring downtown Pacific Grove. We had a delicious brunch at the Red House Cafe, which we highly recommend. Hope to stay here again in the future!"
5500336,163981181,2017-06-25,11211391,Lara,"We loved staying at Little Ligthouse.  The hosts were very responsive to our needs, the house was very clean, and the location could not be beat!  We were walking distance to everything.  The outdoor area was very pleasant.  We also appreciated the fact the house came equipped with a Pack n' Play crib.  We brought ours on this trip, but it's nice to know the house has one for future stays.  We will be back!"
5500336,166456350,2017-07-03,7008366,Maryann,"This listing is the perfect place to stay if you want a cozy get-away in a walkable area. Our hosts were very communicative and thought of everything.

I'm a very light sleeper, so I worried about having upstairs neighbors. Our hosts left earplugs just in case, but I didn't need them. I'm sure some of that has to do with who your neighbors are, but we didn't have a problem."
5500336,169489279,2017-07-12,119686714,Cody,"Such an incredible cottage!!! We were so blessed to have this quaint home away from home as we traveled to Monterey. We loved how close the cottage was to Cannery Row which made everything within walking distance. The cottage itself was incredibly well kept, exactly as described, and more amazing than the listing could describe. We will most certainly be visiting again!"
5500336,174648486,2017-07-26,4604439,Guy,"Nice house, garden And very cosy And clean!! Coocking can be a challenge but with so many places to eat maybe its not needed! Great location!"
5500336,177071860,2017-08-01,34587497,Lisa,"What a darling cottage.I only have one complaint...Its SO cozy and inviting you hate to leave. :) Our family has been visiting the Monterey Coast for 20 years and this has been by far our most favorite place to stay. My favorite antique store(Pacific Grove Antiques) just a short walk down Lighthouse and the rest of our favorite shops,restaurants and bakeries (Pavels) all in walking (Website hidden by Airbnb) daughters were able to enjoy the two guest passes provided for the Monterey Aquarium and thrilled to walk past the long lines and right in through the  Member Entrance.All the attention to detail and thoughtful touches throughout the cottage made this trip our best one yet! We can only hope its available next year when we return!"
5500336,178112624,2017-08-04,5048641,Nuria,"Everything was good at the little lighthouse. Very very walkable, even with kiddos! Nice, cozy and clean!"

5500336,180954343,2017-08-11,94722570,Kimberly,"Perfect for our small family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children). Expertly decorated, great location, and our stay was lovely. Highly recommend."

5500336,191768751,2017-09-08,17429714,Brian,"The lighthouse cottage was beautiful and charming, and we loved being able to walk to Pacific Grove and to Monterey. The hosts were considerate, flexible, and easy to reach. Recommended!"
5500336,194975249,2017-09-17,26073435,Jameel,"This was a great find. The hosts were great communicators, and the place is exactly how it looks. We loved the location. A quick walk to some great restaurants and really close to the water and aquarium. Would highly recommend."
5500336,196031891,2017-09-21,28502598,Ali,"The Little Lighthouse is just as charming and lovely as the pictures suggest.  My husband and I stayed for 3 nights, and it was perfectly comfortable for the two of us.  The location of the cottage can't be beat: A short walk to the beach or town.  It's also a short drive to Carmel-by-the-Sea.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
5500336,197510772,2017-09-25,125892816,Meredith,This was a beautiful place.  Very romantic.  We had an amazing time!

5500336,204557973,2017-10-18,2880355,Claudia,"That’s what you want in airbnb!
We spent 4 days in this lovely airbnb in Pacific Grove. Little Lighthouse Cottage is equipped with all the necessary amenities and it is decorated with taste and love. It’s obviously a place that the owners themselves care about. I particularly liked the fact that there is a lot of space. The place is just a couple of steps away from the ocean and within walking distance of the Aquarium. The owners responded swiftly, positively and friendly to all our enquiries."
5500336,254096992,2018-04-15,93127956,David,"Nice, clean and well located cottage.  Best suited for two people.  Easy access to town and the beach."
5640289,34732483,2015-06-11,1925244,Nithya,"We had a wonderful stay at the Three seas cottage for two nights in June 2015. Julia responded to our reservation request promptly and was in checked in with is multiple times until our stay was over. The cottage is in a great location. Big sur, pebble beach, Carmel beach, Monterey and other places are short drives away. The house is tastefully decorated yet cozy. We loved having breakfast out on the deck overlooking their beautiful garden. The kitchen has is fully equipped and we cooked a few meals there. 

We will definitely stay here again when we are back in the area. "
5640289,35488859,2015-06-19,34370091,Karen,"Loved everything about staying in this home.  Clean, newly remodeled, beautifully decorated with an ocean flair.  The hosts welcomed us with yummie homemade cinnamon rolls.  You can't beat the water pressure for showering :)  I really can't find anything I didn't like about the home -- except it will probably be extremely difficult to find another open date in the future."
5640289,39624195,2015-07-25,31728944,Rudolf,"We had a great time at the three sees cottage! Kevin and Julia contacted us well in advance with all the details that we required for our arrival at their cottage. The cottage was even more beautiful than they described and was the perfect place to relax. Very clean, comfortable beds, great kitchen for cooking, close to many stores and a short drive to the sights. The balcony was great for BBQ and had a beautiful view of the Pacific. I would recommend their cottage to anyone, and would definitely try to stay there again if I visited Monterey in the future."

5640289,56033021,2015-12-08,5454364,Marge Jane,"The 3  Seas Cottage in Pacific Grove was super. It was true to the description posted; actually better. All of the 3 bedrooms were good size ( with very comfortable beds as well as a comfortable queen size sleeper couch in the great room) and the kitchen /dining area was very spacious. There is a large deck and backyard. In addition to the delicious home made cinnamon rolls, the place had all of the amenities that a person would want or need. We cooked all meals there. Location was very convenient to Asilomar, 17 Mile Drive, Cannery Row/the Wharf by bike , car or, for the energetic person, by foot. Walking distance to eating and grocery stores. Neighborhood was quiet and neighbors very nice and friendly. We highly recommend the 3 Seas Cottage and would definitely stay there again."
5640289,60322268,2016-01-22,49997429,Shelley,Julia and Kevin are amazing! The home was even more adorable than I expected. Everything was just perfect. The house is straight out of a pottery barn ad and everything in it's place. Julia left us homemade cinnamon rolls which were out of this world! We truly enjoyed our time in Pacific Grove and I attribute most of that to the Three Seas Cottage!
5640289,60567782,2016-01-25,48584123,Peter,"Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!   The beds are incredibly comfortable and the house is immaculate, welcoming and in a great location.  We couldn’t ask for a better place to stay and can’t wait to stay again next year (that is if you’ll have us!).

Thanks again,
Pete and Kate"
5640289,61169956,2016-02-01,27843684,Mihriban,"Description of the house was very good. It was a very good neighborhood with a lot of natural beauty and shops nearby. Our family had a great time in the house. Kevin and Julia were flexible about our check-in time. We did not need to, but with a young kid we could. One thing different from our prior stays was, the hosts were asking putting the sheets in the garage by laundry. Everyone has their own rules so we respected their rules as guests should, but we were not expecting that probably. That was not bad but different from what we experienced before for rentals by airbnb or other resources. 

Overall very good stay, kind hosts. Thanks...


"
5640289,61750501,2016-02-08,21041400,Azadeh,"We spent 2 nights here and the place is lovely. It's more than a cottage - more like a cozy home away from home! There were 5 of us: My husband and I, my father and my 2 small kids (ages 6 and 4.5). There was plenty of room for all of us to relax and enjoy. Clean, organized and nicely decorated. Very friendly neighbors who'd wave and smile on their daily walks by. Within walking distance of some good eats (try Vito's italian!). Only a few minutes drive from the aquarium (thanks for the free passes!). All in all, a great escape with our family :)"
5640289,63478435,2016-02-23,54528155,Ed,"Julia was very easy to talk with and made coming here very pleasant.  My family and I enjoyed every minute including the tranquility of the  back deck (my fav spot). It is close to everything.  The Monterey Aquariam was only 10 min away!  

The decor itself was something out of a Better Homes magazine.  It was perfect and thoughtful.  I made a great Italian dinner because everything I needed was on deck.  Great range and space to cook on.

It wasn't just a house, it was a home for the weekend.  Our family made some great memories. Thanks Kevin and Julia!"
5640289,64078351,2016-02-29,14697208,Jessica,The three seas cottage was clean with a nice view in a great area. Our stay was very pleasant.  And the listing looks exactly like it's photos. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others!

Kevin & Julia also had everything you need to cook at home, with well stocked pantry and fridge. They also have a help yourself policy to many amenities. Furnished beautifully, and they definitely care about their home. The Aquarium passes were perfect as well!"
5640289,70622403,2016-04-19,17000665,Rawni,"Kevin and Julia's beautiful home hosted my husband's family from the east coast during our wedding weekend. They were comfortable and able to enjoy the gorgeous sunsets from the deck. It is close to groceries and fun activities. They also enjoyed the use of the aquarium passes. All together an amazing stay, and we felt relief knowing our family was comfortable and enjoying time together in a home setting. Julie was very accomadating to our request for our family to stay an extra night. We highly recommend the house and their hospitality."

The house is beautiful, just as pictured. It was clean and very comfortable for our family of 6. The neighborhood is quiet and conveniently located within walking distance to Trader Joe's, Safeway, and some restaurants. The back deck is delightful for a cookout or just relaxing. We would highly recommend the Three Seas Cottage to anyone visiting Monterey. By the way, if you're there on Monday afternoon, don't miss out on the farmer's market in Pacific Grove. We got some amazing produce to enjoy for our stay. "
5640289,77812765,2016-06-03,3365034,Maryam,"We stayed here for two nights on our way up north with the intention of visiting the Aquarium.  The place was comfortable and spacious, the location was perfect and the hosts were great!  Kevin and Julia were very responsive (within seconds) and made sure we had everything we needed.  The front landscaping is so pretty!

I walked around barefoot the entire time and my feet were completely clean!  I was impressed with how clean the floors were.

Overall a great place to stay and we would stay here again!"
5640289,79380180,2016-06-12,53365097,Carrie,"Kevin and Julia we had an amazing stay at the Three Seas Cottage. It was perfect for our family. Super comfy, cozy and sweetly decorated. The neighborhood was quiet and the neighbors were super friendly. We loved how close everything was within walking distance. The cinnamon rolls were amazing! Thank you for having coffee as we drank allot of that and enjoyed it on the front porch and back deck. We definitely would come back and stay in your sweet home. "
5640289,80770021,2016-06-19,47355821,Heather,"This is a great place to stay to be in the heart of Monterey/Pacific Grove.  The neighborhood is safe and inviting, as are the neighbors. The house is beautiful and Julia and Kevin think of everything and are easy to work with. The back yard has a fantastic deck for al fresco dining and an area to have a little fire and roast marshmallows. The ocean view isn't bad either! We hope to return many more times in the upcoming years! "

This location was perfect--close to beaches, supermarkets and many more amenities.  Our party consisted of six and the layout of having a comfy queen bed in every bedroom was perfect.  The deck views of the ocean were awesome and we took full use of the outdoor seating to play a card game and enjoy the quiet surroundings.  Definitely would not hesitate to book this one again.  Thanks again Julia for sharing you beautiful home with our family.  "

OK beliggenhed ifht Monterey og Carmel området.

5640289,90007054,2016-07-30,15462752,Katherine,"We felt very privileged to stay at Three Seas - it really is a very special home from home.  Beautifully decorated, very comfortable and with easy access to shops.  The neighborhood is lovely - neighbors very chatty and friendly.  We enjoyed sitting in the morning sunshine on the porch and feeding the jays, bread for lunch from Pawels Bakerei and afternoons rock-pooling at Asilomar.  "
5640289,91264792,2016-08-04,1195857,Phillippa,"Location is great for the Monterey area. The house was clean, homely and met all our needs. We enjoyed being able to visit the aquarium with 2 guest passes and although the weather was overcast we were perfectly placed to visit the beach, coast and 17 mile drive. Coffee on arrival and simple to use laundry facilities added to our positive experience. Perfect."
5640289,99400777,2016-09-04,49752469,Anna,"Kevin and Julia's place is so stunning and cozy! Everyone wow at the house when they entered. We accidentally took their aquarium passes and need to send them back when we arrived home, but they are super understanding! "
5640289,101464947,2016-09-13,15828719,Kate,Kevin and Julia's place exceeded our expectations. Three of us couples were getting together for a friends wedding in Big Sur and it was a great location and the perfect house for all 6 of us. We enjoyed the porch and having breakfast together! Our stay was fairly short we talked about coming back and would definitely look into staying here again! 
5640289,102962793,2016-09-19,49795223,Margaret,"We love the house! It was perfect for us and our friends. The location is very convienent. The neighbor's are really nice. Julia and Kevin have the special touch and talent that makes a home special, with local feel and decor!"

5640289,105010415,2016-09-29,24377591,Louise,Beautiful house well equipped with everything we needed. Waking up to the sunrise over the fog and the sea was delightful. The house was better than described! Walking distance to Lighthouse Avenue. We recommend Passionfish and Asilomar Beach. Thanks Kevin and Julia. 
5640289,107262451,2016-10-09,55559007,Erik,"The house was just perfect for my group. Warm, cozy and inviting. It made our trip even better than planned."
5640289,108174009,2016-10-14,7409261,Angeline Barretta,We received periodic texts/emails from Kevin and Julia--critical since we made the arrangements several months ago.  The pictures of the house don't do it justice--it was even better.  The neighbors were friendly and the neighborhood delightful.
5640289,109045077,2016-10-18,9395649,Jackie,"Three Seas Cottage is an absolute delight and surpassed our expectations. It is well located meaning easy access to both the Pacific Coast, Monterey and travellling onto the Big Sur. The house worked perfectly for our group with plenty of space to relax and beautifully appointed bedrooms. Extras like use of the washing machine and the acquarium passes where hugely appreciated.  Communication with Julia was excellent. She was always responsive and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Three Seas Cottage to other Airbnb users. "
5640289,110372641,2016-10-25,63496213,Carol,"We loved the location, and the bedrooms were a good size for this part of California.  Wished we had known there was a washer and dryer; that was not in the amenities.  The deck overlooking the ocean was very nice.  There is a Safeway in walking distance which was super handy. Excellent communication before and during our stay.  This is an awesome house for the price. Thanks for such a great vacation!"
5640289,112676881,2016-11-06,63023421,Mark,"This was by far the best AirBnB experience I could have hoped for. Julia and Kevin were extremely welcoming from the very start. They were always very responsive and helped make sure the trip went perfectly. The home is in a nice, peaceful location and is gorgeous, immaculately kept and super well-decorated. The view of the water from the back porch is absolutely beautiful. It was the perfect place for me and my family to spend a few special days in Monterey. Thank you so much for everything, Julia and Kevin!"
5640289,113158335,2016-11-10,5090278,Sergio,"Hermosa casa, llena de detalles muy acogedores.
En un barrio y pueblo muy tranquilo.
Fueron muy generosos y nos dejaron unos tickets de temporada para el acuario de Monterrey que realmente valieron la pena. 

 "
5640289,114004559,2016-11-14,34585952,Steve,"Our family had a great time at Kevin and Julia's home!  Everything about it was perfect!  We came in for the weekend and spent 3 nights.  We felt like we were in our own home.  The house is beautifully decorated, has everything you need to cook meals, if you choose, and the back porch and yard is beautiful!  It sits in a quiet neighborhood and is close enough to walk to Pacific Grove's quaint downtown areas.  Some favorite restaurants we ate at are Red House and Rosine's (a ""Triple D"" restaurant).  And, Julia and Kevin are very good at providing local information prior to your trip. You will love this house!  "
5640289,114951012,2016-11-20,28302844,Cody,"First off I would like to say that the pictures online do not do this home justice. It is extremely spacious yet cozy at the same time. My daughter wants to move here! ;) The aquarium passes are an awesome added bonus and everything is so close, like within minutes. We will definitely be back. Thanks again for a great vacation and such an easy transaction and communication. "
5640289,117122319,2016-12-04,13286064,Ana,Great place for a weekend getaway with the family. The house looked even better than the photos. We loved everything about it and had no complaints.

5640289,123467177,2016-12-29,50371408,Maria,"This place is excellent, it is very quiet, very comfortable, beautifully decorated and stocked with everything one might need. The views are great from every window. The house is a few minutes drive from my favorite places, the Asilomar State Beach and of course the 17-mile drive which I rode on my road bike back and forth.  Carmel and Monterey are also very close. It is very convinient to have Safeway and Trader Joe's just down the street from the house. I hope I will have another chance to come back to Pacific Grove and to this place."
5640289,124368459,2017-01-01,4090456,Christine,Great clean and comfortable beach house in a beautiful part of the world.  Kevin and Julia were great hosts and provide everything you need for a comfortable visit.  They even leave passes to the aquarium which at $49 each is a huge help to the holiday budget!  
5640289,126174680,2017-01-09,98819016,Terry,I received an email well in advance of our stay welcoming us with information on accessing the home.  Location was great and neighborhood was lovely.  Photos were totally accurate.  We will stay again!  AND tell friends.
5640289,127727649,2017-01-20,11586350,Janice And Paul,"My wife and I loved Kevin and Julia's home. They have recently upgraded the property making it beautiful both inside and outside. My wife, who is an interior decorator, loved Julia's choice of decorations throughout the house. The house is secluded in a quiet neighborhood, yet just a couple of miles from places like down town Pacific Grove (great shops and restaurants) and the Monterey Aquarium and Cannery Row. We would love to stay here again the next time we are in the area!
Paul and Janice"

The kitchen is well stocked with anything you'd need for a home cooked meal and some wine by candlelight. The beds and sofas are uber comfortable. Julia made checking in a breeze, and the aquarium passes were a real bonus. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone! Honestly PERFECT for a friends trip to Big Sur and Monterey. "

Our family had a great stay for a 60th Birthday celebration. The rate was reasonable and the value is amazing. Everything we needed for a relaxing stay was provided. The mattresses were comfortable and the furnishings of the home were perfect! The location is the best part. Close to everything but far enough away to feel secluded. Communication with Julia could not have been better. This rental was so easy from start to finish. In closing, we cannot wait to return. Perfection! "

It was so nice to have all 3 rooms with queen size beds as there were 6 of us, so it was perfect. It was mostly girls in the house, so we appreciate the little things like extra bath towels, a blow dryer, straighter, hairspray and extra toilet paper. Kevin and Julia kept a well-stock house so we were able cook breakfast and dinner. Plus they had complimentary Keurig coffee and tea for us.  The house felt like a home with the beautiful decor and furnishings. Also, Julia was very quick to answer any questions I had. Overall, they were very considerate and thoughtful hosts! I HIGHLY recommend this home!!"
5640289,157854085,2017-06-04,127527330,Laura,Kevin and Julia's home is by far the best place we have rented. They thought of everything to make this place cozy and comfortable. I only wish we had rented it for 1 more day. I highly recommend this place if you are ever in the area.

We appreciated a lot every minute spent in the house, and every place in the house. All you need is at walking distance for your daily subsistance. the view from the deck is gorgeous. We had the weather with us. I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends and would certainly come back if you travel to Monterey. Julia and Kevin are responsive, helpful and very pleasant to talk to. Thanks again for hosting us."

5640289,178041121,2017-08-04,69666826,Brendan,"We stayed here as part of a California trip. The house is beautiful. Lovely decor which surpasses the impression given from the pictures! It is ideally located to enjoy the whole peninsular with easy access to Monterey, Carmel and the 17 mile drive and near the Number 2 bus. Sadly we had a short stay, enough time to see the sights but not enough time to relax and enjoy this beautiful home and veranda."
5640289,182063699,2017-08-13,62871453,Jin,"The home was lovely with many charms in a quiet neighborhood.  It's close to the aquarium, markets, gas stations and restaurants.  Julia was super responsive to my emails and questions.  I especially appreciated her honesty.  A week before our trip, I made a reservation change online and the System charged me an erroneous fee, Julia emailed me the next morning and rectified the problem.  We enjoyed our stay at the home with couple minor issues with the bathroom but not a deal breaker."

5640289,189461386,2017-09-01,145226147,Mark,"This is a fantastic place. Conveniently located to everything, yet a nice quiet neighborhood. Stores are a walk away, and so many sights and restaurants to choose from within minutes. Kevin and Julia did a wonderful job with the house. They are very welcoming, and quick to respond to communication. It makes for a nice respite from the hustle of a day of sight seeing. It was great to relax on the deck watching and listening to the ocean. The Aquarium passes are an added bonus. Would highly recommend to anyone, and would love to come back.  Far exceeded expectations."
5640289,193432151,2017-09-13,96558946,Barbara,"This is a perfect home away from home.  Perfect location to everything there is to do in the Monterey Bay area.  Hosts provide coffer for their guests which is a nice surprise.  There were 4 of us (girls getaway) so had plenty of space.  I can't say enough nice things about his home.  We ate lunch at FiFi's (pricey but good) bought groceries at Safeway and TJ's, ate twice on the wharf, used the aquarium tickets (nice extra), Did an evening hh at Roy's on the 17 mile drive ($10.25 entry fee but refundable with a $35 food purchase) - easy to do.  Bagpiper plays at dusk - in our case came around 6:15 pm...  So many choices of places to eat and things to do..."

It was clean, great location, nice quiet neighborhood.  Easy, short drive to Cannery Row, Aquarium, shopping and restaurants.  We were there for a weekend at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, an easy 30 min drive.  We had a great trip and enjoyed staying at the Three Seas Cottage.  Thank you Kevin and Julia!"
5640289,198764822,2017-09-30,22496919,Barbara,"A spacious, modern and clean house within easy reach of Pacific Grove and Monterey.  Hosts couldn't have been more helpful. Would definitely recommend."
5640289,202255023,2017-10-10,94643528,Janet,"The house is lovely and decorated in a fun, local style.  The view from the patio is awe inspiring.  It is a convenient location to stores even within walking distance.  Everything was neat and clean. Beds comfortable, bathrooms nice, lots of towels, etc.    The kitchen spacious and comfortable. My housemates and I grew up there and  we had former classmates over, lots of room for entertaining.  I would love to stay there again. My housemates loved it too.  It exceeded my expectations.  Kevin and Julia are really nice too.  

Also, there is a Keurig and coffee maker to meet the need for caffeine in a thorough manner. :-)"
5640289,203811148,2017-10-15,15819045,James,"Great place for families ... felt like we were visiting someone's house for the weekend and didn't have the ""sterile"" feel that alot of vacation rentals have.  Had alot of simple extras like pods for the Keurig, plenty of kitchen utensils and shampoo/soap in the the bathrooms.  Nice neighborhood but you'll want to drive to the beach or Cannery Row since it would be a little far to walk (not a big deal).  We may be back!"
5640289,204760595,2017-10-19,141563126,Rose Anne,We loved sitting outside on the deck for coffee in the AM.  Kitchen was well stocked.  The large table served us well for evenings of cards and games.

They were easy to communicate with, replied promptly, and made sure to notify us about a potential power outage during our stay. The house itself was so cute and fully stocked with aquarium tickets, towels, coffee maker, and beautiful balcony/view. I definitely recommend this home for your next Monterey Peninsula getaway."
5640289,207175972,2017-10-28,110568847,Joyce,"A beautiful home.  So comfortable.  You feel the warm hospitality as soon as you cross the threshold. Spend as much time as you can on the deck whether it is to welcome a new day sipping a warm cup of joe or enfolding yourself in the transition of day into dusk enjoying the smooth finish of a CA sauv blanc.  And if you’re really lucky....watch the fog slowly come in and let it embrace you.  
And not to forget...you have the good fortune of having Julia and Kevin as wonderful hosts.  
Joyce and Ken"

5640289,215055676,2017-11-27,111440966,Rachel,"we stayed at this lovely house just after thanksgiving for the weekend, we couldn't have been more pleased with choosing this location !
The house is beautifully located in a quiet housing area with so much space, our first thought was 'it doesn't look this big in the photos!' the rooms were so clean and well presented. Every bedroom was comfortable, kitchen perfect for making some home cooking after all the eating our we had done! the best part was the terrace were we sat and had BBQs in the evening. 
we used this spot to visit Big Sur, Levis stadium for a 49ers game and visiting the local area. it couldn't have been more perfect. Super handy to be able to do some washing and get some WiFi (although a bit sketchy if you are out of the living/kitchen area) when we'd been travelling from LA.
Overall we had a fantastic time and only wish we could have been there longer, thank you so much for welcoming us to your home and if we are ever back that way we are sure to return! xx"

We couldn’t use aquarium ticket as the previous guest forgot to return them. Julia was refund ticket fees to us which was very kind. The location is great. There’re two big supermarket nearby the house. The aquarium is just less than 10-15 min away. We ll definitely come back again.

You will be hard pressed to find more gracious hosts! The cottage is beautifully and creatively decorated, with comfortable and cozy gathering places- some even with a view of the bay! 
We can’t wait to return!"
5640289,235178054,2018-02-15,163597556,Mark,"This cottage is an amazing place to make amazing memories.  The decor is beautiful as well as comfortable, and it is immaculate inside and out.  We enjoyed our stay and would make a return visit without hesitation."
5640289,239867355,2018-03-03,33316577,Anne,Three Seas Cottage has a lot of charm.  It is very well-equipped and we were very comfortable there.  We only wish the weather had been warmer so we could take advantage of the attractive outdoor space.
5640289,241882208,2018-03-10,136896386,Nicole,"We stayed 2 days with 6 friends at Julia's and Kevin's house on our roadtrip from Santa Barabara to San Francisco and couldn't ask for anything better than this place. Beautiful house, comfy beds, a kitchen with everything you need and  lovely details im every room. We didn't miss anything!"
5640289,244539997,2018-03-18,117364614,Catherine,"Great location and House was perfect! 3 queen beds, 2 nice size bathrooms and views of the pacific. 3 of us ladies had a great time - easily could have fit 3 more if you don’t mind sharing queen beds. Kitchen had all cooking utensils and was stocked with coffee, seasonings etc. Quick Drives to hikes, Carmel and Inn at Spanish Bay to watch the sunset! We’ll be back!"
5640289,247489531,2018-03-28,621785,Sewellyn,"This house is in a perfect location, although you will want to drive in to town. You can easily walk over to Trader Joe's or Safeway, and the iw from the back is one of the reasons that we come here.
Our friends also likes that it was all one floor-and nothing too fussy, so you didn't feel inhibited."
5640289,250591604,2018-04-05,6890611,Lael,"I loved EVERYTHING about Kevin and Julia's place, and I'm picky, so that means something! It was so clean, but not sterile, instead I found their home warm, cozy and creatively decorated. I appreciate the attention to details and carefully thought out amenities!"
5640289,252241612,2018-04-09,55871644,Paull,"We had a great time, would have been great if we had some more time."
5640289,253503679,2018-04-14,93709063,Beth,"This place was so convenient to everything.  It was very comfortable and a great place to relax after a busy day of sightseeing.  We didn’t make it to the Monterey Aquarium, but that is a nice bonus.  Had fun at the Monterey Farmers Market Friday.  Definitely would love to come back!!!!!"
5640289,255202288,2018-04-19,142025811,Andrew,"This is a great place to stay while visiting the area. The house is stocked to meet your needs, but if you need something, Trader Joe's is 3 blocks away. The street is quiet but it's close to everything. You can tell the property is important to the owners, it is well taken care of."
5807126,32362563,2015-05-17,12114225,Jacob,"This is the cutest little house you ever did see! It is perfect for a getaway! It sleeps 5 very comfortably. The beach is about a 2 minute walk away. You are so close to Lovers Point, the Aquarium, downtown monterey. The neighborhood is quiet and everyone there is friendly. House is clean and updated. Has beautiful natural light all throughout! The hosts are very welcoming, kind and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend staying here and will be staying again in the future!"
5807126,33097618,2015-05-25,1273589,Chris,"Our stay at the cottage was phenomenal! It's really clear the owners put a lot of thought and effort into both the decoration and stay experience. The entire place is newly renovated and has all of the basic goods you'll need - blankets, coffee maker, toaster, bluetooth speaker - and they left us a bottle of prosecco for when we arrived. There were also two guest aquarium passes we didn't even know about, which saved us $80 in tickets. The place easily sleeps six between the two bedrooms, one person office sleeping area, and mattress nook under the stairs. The only caveat is that the single shower can be a bottleneck. Parking was indeed plentiful, and the location is great. I'll absolutely try to stay here again the next time I come to Monterey."
5807126,33815341,2015-06-01,2104640,Rachel,"My family's stay at Lighthouse Cottage was absolutely wonderful! It's beautifully decorated, perfectly located, spacious, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, and then some. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Monterey/Pacific Grove! "
5807126,34806836,2015-06-12,33845677,Nina,Very welcome!!!
5807126,34949741,2015-06-14,4024935,Laura,"We had a great time during our stay seeing seals and sea lions on the beach, exploring at the aquarium, and enjoying the view from the deck with a glass of wine. And we loved that we could walk anywhere we wanted to go!

It was plenty roomy for two couples and a four year old, who loved spending time in the ""cabin"" -- a cute little cubby off the stairs -- that I don't think is currently pictured, which made it a fantastic surprise! 

In addition to the place and its location, we would whole heartedly recommend these hosts. They were very proactively communicative before and during our stay -- updating us when Cottage pictures were posted, a thorough email about keyless door entry, parking, and all the details that make one feel confident about getting there and knowing what to do, including a heads up on a bit of refrigerator repair that might've been wrapping up around check-in time.  Amy even called us shortly after we arrived to make sure check-in went smoothly."
5807126,35559030,2015-06-20,9018091,Thomas,"House was immaculate and in great location for visiting aquarium (we walked) or day trips to Carmel, 17 mile drive and big sur.  highly recommend lighthouse cottage to other guests.  The two free passes to the aquarium was a very nice perk!"
5807126,36025077,2015-06-24,12723496,Gary,"This place is absolutely lovely. Extremely clean and well appointed. Short walk to the aquarium, ocean, restaurants and shops. The cottage is well equipped and Gary, Lynea and family were great hosts. "
5807126,36383054,2015-06-28,4456836,Karla,"This is my first experience using Airbnb. Hosts Gary, Lynea, Jim, Stacey and Amy made it an easy experience. Their communications were timely and clear; I was never kept wondering about any of the details.

It was an absolute joy to stay in this cottage. Our 20-something sons each had their own room, while my husband and I enjoyed the master bedroom at the tippy- top of the house.  Loved, loved, loved all the attention to details and decor.  After about 5 minutes in the place, my husband and I said, ""We could live here!""  We all thoroughly enjoyed sitting at the kitchen table, looking at the ocean view through the old hand-made glass. Charm in every nook and cranny. 

The location was awesome -- close to tons of restaurants, Cannery Row and the aquarium -- and easy street parking. If there were guests downstairs in the Little Cottage, we never saw them or heard them. 

I am already trying to think of a time to come back!"
5807126,38260072,2015-07-14,11490076,Amanda,"The accommodations are exactly like the pictures, and just as clean.  There was wonderful space for 5 of us, and it was a great location for walking to the aquarium and downtown Pacific Grove for dinner.  Communication was excellent - the hosts notified me of a problem they encountered before our stay began and let us know how they were going to correct it, so it didn't end up being a problem for us at all.  I would highly recommend this cottage to anyone visiting the Monterey Bay area!"
5807126,38597383,2015-07-17,32766150,Jason,"Our family had a great experience at the Lighthouse cottage!  Everything listed in the description is accurate: fantastic views of the ocean, easy walking distance to Monterrey wharf, downtown Pac Grove and the beach; and the quaint but appropriately updated cottage feel.  The aquarium passes were a HUGE benefit, and our 3 boys loved spending the day there.

But it's also the little things that make the difference: toiletries in each bathroom, coffee in the pantry, fresh towels and linens, detailed notes and recommendations in the welcome binder; and best of all, Amy was always there to assist -  even after we checked out and had questions about where to stop on our way to Cambria.

Our only regret is that we could have stayed more than 2 nights - there was a lot to explore and this was the perfect headquarters to do so."
5807126,40322328,2015-07-30,28161035,Laurel,"Everything about the Lighthouse Cottage was lovely! The location is super close to everything you would want to do in the Monterey area (the Aquarium (2 passes included!), beaches, restaurants, etc.). We immediately felt at home in the beautifully decorated and cozy space...we even were able to watch whales from the kitchen and upstairs bedroom! A wonderful place to stay!"
5807126,41220735,2015-08-05,30658243,Elmira,"We had an amazing stay at the Lighthouse Cottage!
Few things about why our whole family enjoyed it so much:
THE COTTAGE
It is full of character, it is clear that every corner of this cottage received the love it deserves when selecting the furniture and finishing touches. It is beautifully styled, super clean and equipped with everything you could possibly need on your stay. We truly felt welcomed and at home here. The patio with its comfy sofa and chairs is the perfect spot to relax with a glass of wine. Beds are very comfy and the master bedroom window has the best sunset view!
THE LOCATION
We easily walked to Lovers Point beach, the Aquarium and for a morning coffee at the La Strada. While close to all the sights, cottage is in a tucked away location, very quiet and away from the tourist noise.
OTHER 
Worth mentioning that the two aquarium passes helped us skip the very long line, you can buy additional tickets at the will call if you have more than 2 people in your party. The keyless access is great! No need to carry keys around and easy to get back in if you split up from the main group.
Our family trip was absolutely wonderful, and the Lighthouse Cottage and its hosts made it possible.
We would love to return again!!!
Thank you!!!"
5807126,41936672,2015-08-10,32783773,Cathy,"The lighthouse cottage was one of the best things we have done. Going on vacation is great but to stay in a nice, beautiful, and cozy home was great. My family and I had a great time! Thank you so much! We hope to be back again!"
5807126,44763910,2015-08-29,12219804,Krystal,"My best friend and I take an annual ""girls trip"" every year to some place different; this year Pacific Grove area made the cut :) This trip is something we look forward to every year and where we stay can really have an impact on how enjoyable our trip is. This year was really wonderful! We loved the Lighthouse Cottage- it was in a great location, really comfortable and full of all the necessary amenities (as well as super clean!).  The process of booking, arriving and getting started on our vacation was seamless. Nothing to complain about and all things positive to say! We would definitely come back (in fact I am thinking of bringing my husband here for our next get away!) Thanks for such a great place to stay for our very special week this year. Best, Krystal"
5807126,45166831,2015-08-31,41628129,Sophie,"We had an amazing weekend at the Lighthouse Cottage. Everything was exactly as described, the rooms are all very cosy and each has a very special and different atmosphere. We particularly enjoyed sitting at the kitchen table for breakfast and enjoying the beautiful view on the Bay. The cottage is well situated, within walking distance to Ocean View and cute shops and cafés. "
5807126,45555691,2015-09-04,3294628,Nora,"We had a wonderful experience at the Lighthouse Cottage.  The location is great- 2 blocks from the coast, 15 minutes walk in one direction to Pacific Grove and in the other direction to the tourist area of Monterey.  Lots of restaurants and things to do.  There is a beautiful trail running all along the coast for walking/running/biking  (access 2 blocks from the property.)

The house is very, very nice.  It looks brand new inside.  It is beautifully decorated and full of character as it is a carriage house restoration.  There are great views of the ocean from many rooms, especially good from the kitchen and the upper deck.  I stayed for 3 days with my Mother.  Everything we needed was readily available. Easy on-street parking in the neighborhood. 

The hosts were great.  Responsive to questions, organized, and having worked out easy anytime access directions to avoid having to coordinate schedules on arrival.  This was great for us as we were  driving up the coast and uncertain on exact arrival time.  They also left some nice tourist info for us (maps, menus, brochures, etc.) and even let us use their aquarium guest passes. 
Overall, a great experience.  Highly recommended."
5807126,47617807,2015-09-21,8308931,Tracy,"We loved our stay at the Lighthouse main cottage! The home was just as described and even more charming in person. We loved the decor, comfortable living areas and beds, and had everything we needed. The views and porch were wonderful, and the location can't be beat. We walked to downtown Pacific Grove several times, and found some great restaurants for breakfast and dinner. The 2 Monterey Aquarium passes were a real treat, and we thoroughly enjoyed visiting it and Cannery Row (and so convenient!). We would choose to stay here again if we come back to the area. "
5807126,48498286,2015-09-27,32111677,Nicole,"Simply stunning- Our family of 4 recently stayed at Lighthouse Cottage. It was conveniently located to the key attractions - Coastal track was a short 2 block walk, Aquarium & Cannery Row - restaurants & shops. The 2 guest Aquarium passes provided for our use was great. The whole family had a fantastic time at the Aquarium - my kids were really interested in the interactive displays & also the tank displays which were in a very natural marine setting. The house instantly became our home as soon as we arrived. It is so homely, stylish, beautifully furnished & with every possible item thoughtfully provided & placed. The little parlour next to the main lounge was a favourite in the evening for my husband to disappear & watch soccer. Morning breakfast at the kitchen table looking over the lower rooftops to the sea was special. The upstairs bedroom had beautiful sea views - what a magic spot to wake up. Entry to property was simple & easy parking on the street. The house was presented beautifully & was super clean. The hosts communication was very proactive throughout the entire booking process. We wished we could stay longer, thank you Lighthouse Cottage. "
5807126,48926749,2015-09-29,3695631,Case,We had a terrific stay at Lighthouse Cottage! Unfortunately we only had two nights and would loved to have stayed longer in this beautiful house as it's such a great area with lots to explore. The aquarium visit was great and thoroughly recommended.
5807126,49210961,2015-10-02,37635326,Yu,超级满意的住宿体验!
5807126,49447106,2015-10-04,12246002,Christine,"The best place to stay in Monterey! Great location and such a beautiful and well-decorated space. Hosts left great directions and lots of helpful tips, and provided us with everything we needed. Thank you for a wonderful hassle-free stay."
5807126,49877963,2015-10-07,33191138,Angie,We loves the decoration and the cleanlines. And the wine was most welcome. 
5807126,50278550,2015-10-11,39126547,Kristen,"What a perfect long weekend! We lucked out with sunshine and gorgeous weather, but were pleasantly surprised at the cottage. Better than expected! Fit our needs perfectly and great location! We stayed with my best friend and her husband, and we all thought the decor was so cute and tasteful. We'd love to come back and stay again. Thank you. 

"
5807126,51137649,2015-10-18,42853266,Ellen,"The Lighthouse Cottage was the best AirBnB my friends and I have used!  On our last day, we talked about how we'd recommend the Lighthouse Cottage to any of our friends visiting Monterey.  The house is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, we wished it was our own home! The living room, kitchen, and large bedroom were all welcoming hangout spots in the house.  The location in Pacific Grove is within a nice walking distance to the Aquarium and the shoreline.  The two free passes to the Aquarium were a plus too! There's ample free parking by the house as well (compared to the hotels in Monterey).  

All in all, we loved our experience and will definitely look for the Lighthouse Cottage on our next group trip to Monterey!  Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
5807126,51617583,2015-10-22,42740090,Rebecca,"The house is absolutely beautiful and the hosts were easy to communicate with and very accommodating with any request we made. The house is very well equipped and had everything we needed during our stay. The house is in a great position and a short walk from Monterey aquarium and cannery row and a short drive to bixby bridge and other sites around the area if driving. We all wished we had stayed longer and look forward to returning one day, there wasn't a negative thing any of us could say about our stay and if we could have bought the house back to the UK with us we would have!"
5807126,52369079,2015-10-28,1992148,Scott,"What a darling little spot in PG. Walking distance to Cannery Row, hearing the sounds and smells of the ocean. Amazing. "
5807126,52724817,2015-11-01,1666312,Stephanie,Lighthouse cottage is a lovely place to stay.  Five friends came for the weekend and we all enjoyed the location and the house.  It is well decorated and well stocked.  You can walk to Pacific Grove or Monterey in just a few minutes.  The hosts were responsive and very helpful.  We are hoping to return again next year for our annual girls getaway weekend.  Thanks for a great stay.

5807126,54251046,2015-11-17,10144844,Andreas,This house is perfect!! We had an amazing stay! You really want to be there and therefore we cooked in the kitchen and enjoyed the view!!! We will for sure be there again! It was a great experience and our parents were really amazed how much love is in this building ;-). Thanks again for letting us stay. 
5807126,56723798,2015-12-17,1765242,Daniel,"The place was perfect for my family of four. enough space for everyone to stretch out . Monterey aquarium is only 5 minutes away. this place comes with two free passes to the aquarium! Saved us 80 dollars :)
Location cannot be beat!
Hosts are very responsive to texts. I did have a mild problem with ants inside the property which the host said was due to the cold weather driving them in. Other than this, we really enjoyed our stay and will rebook again in the future"
5807126,58510260,2016-01-03,42238052,Catnjohn,"Wonderful home! charming, cozy and inspiring. Thank you for the amazing service and fantastic home. Clean. Great location to boot."

The cottage is located easy walking distance to the ocean (where you can enjoy a nice walk along the ocean) and to the aquarium (which was really fun- thanks to the owners for the passes!). Also a very quick drive to downtown Monterey. The cottage itself was perfect- more than enough space, great decor, very cozy. I will definitely be back!! The owners were very attentive as well- when we had an issue with the TV cable, we immediately heard from one of the owners to try to help resolve the issue. Thanks for a great weekend!"
5807126,61632750,2016-02-07,20039832,Kris,"We had a terrific time at the lighthouse cottage! The house had all the essentials and really felt like our home away from home! The ocean views are amazing from the house and we were able to walk just a few blocks to enjoy the walking path alongside the water.  

We hope to return every year!  Thanks for having us!"
5807126,62233370,2016-02-13,20568854,David,We really enjoyed our stay here.  Lovely home in a great location.  Lots of nice rooms and a nice kitchen.  Short walk to the ocean and a short drive to the center of Pacific Grove which is a precious town.
5807126,62964393,2016-02-19,6382500,Alex,The hosts are such lovely people you need to only speak to them to feel their warmth. They were quick to respond to queries and always made me feel that they were ready to help if necessary. The house is perhaps the most thought-out Airbnb rental ever. Every you would need is there (save for a washing machine and dryer). The utensils and plates were immaculately clean... Its's unbelievable! It was really such a lovely home at Monterey and I can't wait to return!
5807126,64634295,2016-03-06,14478683,Kaitlin,The house was wonderful! Our group really enjoyed the unique nooks and crannies of this character home. The hosts were pleasant and responsive. I would come here again if I wanted to spend more time in the area.  Love it!
5807126,65005336,2016-03-10,575909,Anna,"We loved this house! Situated on a beautiful, quiet, tree-lined street, this adorable cottage was just perfect for my family of four.  Every detail was attended to with style and quality.  The kitchen was fantastic and perfect for cooking family meals.  The beds were lovely and comfortable, with memory-foam mattresses and quality bedding.  There's even a hidden nook with a bed, not pictured in the listing, that my 5 year old daughter LOVED.  I highly recommend this property.  "
5807126,65499386,2016-03-15,50779734,Alissa,"Listing was just as described.....maybe even better. Perfect location, walkable to everything in Pacific Grove and Monterey. Great, quiet retreat at night. It was just perfect for a short family get away!"
5807126,67816723,2016-03-31,22029361,Stacy,"We truly enjoyed our stay at the lovely  Lighthouse Cottage. The cottage was exactly as described in the listing and pictures and was beautifully decorated and comfortable.  The kitchen was well-equipped and our 10 year old son love the sleeping book. The location was fabulous - we walked everywhere and we especially enjoyed using the two guest passes to the Monterey aquarium.  And we appreciated the instruction binder, tourism and restaurant information and complimentary bottle of wine. We had one or two minor issues figuring out how to use the electric fireplace and heater and our hosts were gracious in helping us figure things out by phone and text. In short, we would highly recommend a stay at the Lighthouse Cottage. "
5807126,69198457,2016-04-10,14913005,Brent,We have a great weekend stay at the lighthouse rental. Place had an awesome vibe with all the decor. The entire house was super clean with an extremely convenient location. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in Monterey. 
5807126,71428131,2016-04-25,17548859,Katherine,"My family had such an amazing experience at the Lighthouse Cottage - we just wish we could have stayed longer. The space itself was perfect for our group (4 adults, 2 children) and the house had everything we needed and more. It was exceptionally neat and clean and we instantly felt at home. My sister and I were there to run the Big Sur Marathon and it was about a 5 minute drive to the start line from the house 

We hope to be back again soon and wouldn't hesitate to stay here! "
5807126,74895076,2016-05-17,59031134,Luralyn,"The Lighthouse Cottage is a beautiful place!  The place is very cozy, especially with the over sized couch.  The bedrooms are nice and beds comfortable.  We especially loved the third floor bedroom with the views. 

The place is as described.  It is also very convenient to places of interest.  The complimentary passes to Monterey Bay Aquarium was an added bonus.

I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."
5807126,75429467,2016-05-21,20430105,Tracey,Although only a short stay really loved this house! Wish the family could come and do my interior decorating in the UK. Lovely location and beautiful house
5807126,76117089,2016-05-24,64831468,Jayne,"Perfect location, very comfortable and cozy, super clean and looks just as nice as in the pictures! As a bonus the bedding is lovely. The upstairs deck is amazing with great seating and a heater. Stocked with ample linens and kitchen cookware/utensils/storage. Good size fridge and a little dishwasher. Room for up to two smaller families here for a reasonable rate. Great hosts, very accommodating. Absolutely would recommend this house to anyone searching in the area! The aquarium passes were an added bonus, a must-see in Monterey. 

Only two drawbacks I see are that there is only one shower and no washer/dryer on site. Other than that the house was wonderful and we had a great stay!"

The decor is very nice and we received immediate responses to all our questions."

5807126,86835950,2016-07-17,42863684,Gay,"The lighthouse cottages are a wonderful place for a family gathering. We rented both lighthouse cottage and little lighthouse cottages for our family of six adults and five children ages 9 months, two, seven, nine and eleven. There was plenty of space for everyone and everything. The granddaughters especially enjoyed the sweet little alcove tucked under the eves off the staircase in lighthouse cottage. It was perfect for daytime play and nighttime sleep. We loved being within walking distance of so many adventures including beaches, aquarium, (thank you for the passes!) and starbucks!  The fireplaces and outdoor patios were also much appreciated. Amy could not have been more gracious and responsive both before and during our stay. We highly recommend the lighthouse cottages. The careful attention to detail in both decor and menu ties will make you feel welcomed and immediately at home. "
5807126,87806385,2016-07-21,45249063,Sean,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Lighthouse Cottage. Parking was easy, right in front of the cottage for the entire stay. We had keypad entry at the front door which worked good for letting family come and go as they please. The cottage was beautifully furnished with comfortable bedding and two gas fireplaces for heating. We really enjoyed hanging out in the kitchen and living room as a family with room for family dinners and late night chats into the wee hours. The location is close to everything. We walked to the aquarium, the beach, and our favorite- downtown Pacific Grove which is a welcome retreat from the touristy Monterey areas with everything you really need. Thank you for making our trip a wonderful and memorable experience we won't forget!"
5807126,89605450,2016-07-29,48977432,Amanda,"This house was incredible. The pictures simply can't do it justice. It was clean, inviting and soooo cozy. We appreciated every detail the owners put into their home. The beds were so comfortable and our daughter loved the sleeping nook! Communication was not only easy but fast! We were lucky to have gotten this house last minute after they had a cancellation. We were paid and checked-in in less than 30 minutes! The area was beautiful. Carmel was adorable! 
Wonderful home! Wonderful touches! Wonderful Hosts!
Wonderful Trip!"
5807126,91060775,2016-08-03,54025628,Marcus,"A very cosy Apartment, near located to the sea. Every thing worked out perfect. We loved the stay so much. Hope to come back soon."
5807126,92429831,2016-08-08,41053174,Matt,A perfect stay from start to finish. This is a beautifully renovated home in a fantastic location - 2 blocks from the sea and 10 minutes on foot to the aquarium and canarry row. The two aquarium passes are a great inclusion and represent a $100 saving!
5807126,92925106,2016-08-10,49888874,Andy,I can't imagine a better property or host! Everything you could possibly imagine was provided and the property is extremely well equipped. Communication was prompt and thorough and the bottle of wine was a lovely welcome. 
5807126,93428417,2016-08-12,52654158,Bill,Had a great stay in Monterey at the lighthouse cottage. Very homely. Everything worked well. Thanks so much for your hospitality. Cheers Bill

5807126,97813304,2016-08-28,43854800,Anna,"What an utterly amazing place!  We felt so lucky to have found it.  Gary, Stacey, Jim, Lynea and Amy have provided a real home from home (only it is far more luxurious than our home, if I'm honest).  They were incredibly responsive to our queries and helped sort the best options for our stay.  We can't wait to go back soon. "
5807126,98773974,2016-09-01,69526534,Risa,"The Lighthouse is a lovely second and third floor apartment with a view of the ocean.  The decor is marvelous, with so many whimsical details in all the rooms -quilts, mirrors, wall hangings, etc.  The apartment is in a great location, right between  downtown Monterey and Pacific Grove, so you can walk to both and a few blocks from the water.   The living room is really cozy and we wish we had more time to hang out on the deck.  

The only drawback was that the street was noisier than we had expected in the mornings.  "
5807126,102661112,2016-09-18,29583475,Mary Margaret,"The Lighthouse Cottage was an excellent choice for our stay. Very convenient to the beach and walking paths, and to downtown Pacific Grove and Monterey, yet quiet, with easy parking. The Cottage is very cute and comfortable, with a nice layout for socializing and a lovely deck. Would definitely recommend, highly!"
5807126,103260201,2016-09-21,52191856,Sabrina,"Place as shown in photos, easy parking and close to geocery store. clean and nicely decorated. the bed on the first floor is a little too soft, would be nice if the mattress is firmer."
5807126,104467061,2016-09-26,82620546,Claire,"We spent 2 nights at Lighthouse Cottage at the end of a 2 week Californian holiday and we wish we'd had longer there! It's a really cute little cottage, full of charm, very cozy and comfortable. The location at Pacific Grove is perfect. 2 short blocks down to the beachfront, if you walk right, you reach the Monterey Bay aquarium and Cannery Row within minutes. Go left and it's a 5-10 minute walk to Lovers Point, we hired bikes there and cycled the 17 Mile Drive which has the most breathtaking oceanfront scenery... Well worth doing, it's a relatively flat cycle each way, turning at the Pebble Beach golf club, and takes around 3 hours with a few stops for photos. The cottage is equipped with an info folder with everything you'd need to know about the house, how to work any of the appliances, and stacks of information on what to do while in the area. There are 2 passes provided to allow free entry into the aquarium, which were a great touch, a complimentary bottle of wine is also a lovely welcome. The sea views are gorgeous from the terrace and the attic bedroom, we enjoyed lounging on the terrace outside after a busy day and enjoying the sunset... It was really hot weather during our stay, but there was a patio heater provided for chilly evenings. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the cottage, we were travelling as a couple and it was perfect. "
5807126,105425772,2016-10-01,31172544,Nicole,"The Lighthouse Cottage was perfection. We plan on coming back again and again. The house was so cutely decorated and was super clean. The  views were breathtaking. It's a short walk from just about everything, we rented tandem bikes and bikes everywhere. The kitchen was so useful for breakfasts and a few homemade dinners. The beds were so comfy too, better than any bed in a hotel. This house is one of the best Air B&Bs we've ever visited. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys quaint settings, good reading spots, and friends over for food. "
5807126,106197989,2016-10-04,54890738,Martin,"Lovely bottle of red awaiting our arrival and everything we expected and more! Loved this place with it's quirky decor and wild deer roaming the streets. it couldn't be any more perfect. Pacific grove feels very safe ands some wonderful unique establishments especially the Victorian corner cafe. The aquarium passes were a added benefit, greatly appreciated.  Take stroll across to Monterey and enjoy the fresco food at Peter B's - wonderful service and value for money"
5807126,106576685,2016-10-07,51426259,David,"Lovely house, exactly as you would expect from the photos. Perfect location for us close to the golf courses. Upstairs suite was awesome with one of the most comfortable beds you will find.

"
5807126,108372098,2016-10-16,8686259,Kristen,"We are a family of 4 and recently stayed 4 nights at the Lighthouse Cottage in Monterrey. It was perfect for our family with 3 bedrooms, although, my two daughters ended up just sharing one of the bedrooms. The third bedroom is a futon couch but we didn't test how comfortable it was.

Lighthouse Cottage is even cuter than the photos look! The attention to detail on the decorating is incredible. Everything is perfectly laid out. TV's are in all the bedrooms and living room with a recordable DVR even. We enjoyed the heated outdoor patio space. It was nice to sit out there in the evening and enjoy a glass of wine. The kitchen is well-stocked with coffee and everything else you would need to cook a meal, although we only cooked breakfasts and enjoyed dining out at the nearby restaurants within walking distance. Our favorite was Il Vecchio! You must try that restaurant if you are in town.

As I mentioned, the location is just a quick walk to the beach and local restaurants. It seems to be on the border of Pacific Grove and Monterrey which makes it easy to walk to either one for shopping/dining. Only 10 min walk to the Aquarium too. Yes, two passes were included which saved us some $.

Some things to note, this cottage has only 1 full bathroom w/ shower. It says that in the description but I think I missed that so my bad on that. The master bathroom is only a 1/2 bath. Honestly, I'm glad I missed that as I may have eliminated this place based on that fact, but really it wasn't a problem having all 4 of us share. The only other niggle was the 10% tax that is for some reason not listed in the fees, it's hidden in the wording about the cottage and sent as a separate payment. I'm not sure why it's not listed in the total fees. I felt like I was getting nickled and dimed but maybe that's just me."
5807126,109685659,2016-10-22,4097292,Alison,"Our anniversary stay at the Lighthouse Cottage was perfect in every way! The house is adorable, the location is great (you can walk to everything), and no detail was overlooked. We loved all the windows - there were ocean views all over the place, but we especially loved watching the sunrise from the 3rd floor master bedroom each morning. This is without question the best rental property we have ever stayed in, and it completely stole our heart. We cannot wait to come back. "

The location is great for walking to restaurants and the aquarium (even wit (Website hidden by Airbnb) year old). The Lighthouse Cottage is a unique property. You can tell it has been lovingy restored, so it feels both historic and brand new (and very clean!). The beds were comfortable and our 4 year old loved the nook for sleeping."

The accommodations were wonderful, beds and linens were super comfy, the couch and fireplace were so cozy that we didn't want to leave!   We were there with a group of 5 women and we fit comfortably in the home.  It was quite stormy during our weekend, so we spent more time cozying up by the fire than we had planned, but it was great.  Walking distance to pacific grove, a 7 min walk to great shops and restaurants.   This place is adorably decorated, and made me want to up my game at home!  It was a wonderful respite from the real world and I would highly recommend it. We will be back!"

Great location (the aquarium was our main destination) and close to the touristy areas.  Far enough where noise, crowds, and parking are also a non-issue.  Would recommend to anyone! 

Note the Pacific Grove surcharge is not included in the advertised cost but is listed in the fine print..."

5807126,157731411,2017-06-04,94405724,Kathleen,"Review of Lighthouse Cottage:

My daughter, her husband, two young children (5 and 1) and I stayed for 4 nights at the Lighthouse Cottage — what a delightful, charming house. We had a fantastic stay; my daughter and son-in-law are already talking about booking another stay. 

When we arrived the house was in great condition: clean, well decorated, and charming. Clear instructions were left about how to operate the various things (remote, neighborhood tips, etc.). My grandkids stayed with us and while it wasn’t fully childproof, it was a very child-friendly place and we appreciated that. A baby gate, bathtub, highchair and pack n play were provided. The house also had coolers and beach chairs to borrow! 

The beds were very comfortable. My son in law and daughter especially loved the top floor bedroom with the king size bed and the chaise lounge parked right next to a window with a view to the sea. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed relaxing up there with a book and the sunset. The house had a really cool surprise in the form of an alcove (with a bed) located just at the top of the staircase where my 5 year old grandson happily slept (complete with twinkly lights). The third room has a pull out couch in lieu of a bed, but it was a great spot to park the Pack n Play for my youngest grandson. I stayed in the front bedroom and it was very comfortable and cozy.

The neighborhood was quiet and charming and we took daily walks to eat (especially recommend Happy Girl Kitchen and Tricycle Pizza), shop and visit the aquarium. There is a Nob Hill Food store, a Rite-Aid, and lots of fun shops located just 10 minutes from the house. 

Bottom line: if you’re a family (or just friends) visiting Monterey Bay for the weekend this is the perfect spot for you."
5807126,160088868,2017-06-12,17109776,Andrea,"We had a lovely stay at the Lighthouse Cottage. Everything was clean, and well thought out. Communication was prompt. Once there, we were able to access the cottage with our code without any issues. 

Inside, every room is decorated with cozy eclectic patterns and vintage details. The windows lining the kitchen/dining area have a beautiful view of the ocean and make it the perfect place to have a home cooked breakfast before taking a quick walk along the coast to the aquarium. 

Grocery stores, shops and restaurants are all easily accessible from the cottage. We were able to walk to Nob Hill for groceries, check out the shops in pacific grove, Cannery Row Brew Co. and Passionfish. 

Highly recommended! We will definitely check out lighthouse again next time we're in Monterey! "
5807126,160819018,2017-06-15,56510863,Richard,What a beautiful home! Easy walks to all the attractions and great dining choices. Can't say enough wonderful things about the location and accommodations. Highly recommend.
5807126,165027554,2017-06-30,33107404,Richard,Recently stayed at the cottage with family for a few days.  The house itself is fantastic and beautifully decorated. It's about a 10/15 min walk down to cannery row and also same time to talk into pacific grove downs town - which personally I liked a bit better for restaurants and shops. The passes to the aquarium are a bonus. One thing I did miss was the absence of a laundry but wound up driving down to sudz laundry and the lady did two loads for me for about 12 on a drop off basis. Would definitely look to stay again if in the area. Parking is everywhere. If doing 17 mile drive make sure you take cash too. 
5807126,168079611,2017-07-08,46858016,Anne,"Darling cottage! Perfect central location!thoughtful,  loving, creative touches throughout. Great use of space! You'll love staying here!!"

We rented both upstairs and downstairs,  and it was just perfect for our group of nine women,  with room to spare! We took decorating notes for our own homes!  No detail left undone,  we had ample bedding and towels,  a full kitchen of supplies and a welcoming deck with a beautiful ocean view.  The best surprise?  The neighborhood deer!

It felt so cozy and unique, and we really did not want to leave. The kitchen was great for cooking as they had all the basic cooking necessities and the place is also walking distance to downtown Pacitic Grove (which is such cute!). We never met the hosts but we had all of the necessary information and contact information in case we had any questions. The only negative is that we could not stay longer!

It is beautifully decorated and has a coziness to it that made us feel immediately comfortable. We found everything we needed in the kitchen, etc...we also enjoyed the close proximity to restaurants and a grocery store. The community in advance of the trip was great and there is a house manual with all of the details when you arrive. If I find myself back in the area again, I would 100% choose to stay here a second time."

The beds were so comfortable and we loved hearing and smelling the ocean breeze was relaxing.  The location was perfect and the hosts were very responsive.  I would recommend to anyone but hope that doesn't mean we'd have trouble booking again in the future due to popularity!!
5807126,237120019,2018-02-21,55045486,Richard,The house is very beautiful and comfortable.  The location is great for downtown Monterey and for the aquarium and surrounding tourist area.

Extremely well decorated and the views from the kitchen, family room, deck and our upper bedroom was fantastic!  They have 2 free passes to the Aquarium which is within walking distance.  The water is a short 2 blocks down and the walk is beautiful to Lover's Point.  We golfed Pebble Beach, Pine Grove course (poor man's Pebble.  Well worth it!), Aquarium, vineyards, wine tasting, Mission Ranch (owned by Clint Eastwood where we had drinks on the patio and overlooked the meadow with the sheep and beach to the right). Communication with the owner was great and my two small questions were answered within minutes.   Oh, and our bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on.  I asked Amy where they get them.  Slept like a baby!  If you go to Pacific Grove, this is definitely the place to stay!!!  We are will go back and rent out the whole place.  Enjoy!!!"
5807126,250080635,2018-04-03,55292092,Jella,"The Lighthouse Cottage is absolutely great! The four of us had a great time - walking down to the beach at Lover's point, the Aquarium, watching the seals in the cove etc. It could not be in a better location. The neighbourhood and cottage are cozy and comfortable, everything was clean, and the hosts provided us with all the necessary information and tips prior to our arrival. Thank you so much! Definitely would come again and recommend to others!"

5860442,31128705,2015-05-02,21129343,Brent,"We had an excellent experience at the Terry's home!

This was my wife and I's first experience with airbnb, and we were pleasantly surprised. Their house was beautiful and the room we stayed in was very clean and had a lot of materials to help guide you on things to do in the area. It was a pleasure to talk with both David and Kelly, as they knew plenty about the area and were even friendly enough to offer us a drink before heading out to dinner. We also had a lovely breakfast, along with the local paper. Velma was a very tame pup, and reminded of of our little critter back home.

Again, great experience and highly recommend. I know we will spend two nights there if we can get a visit in the area again."
5860442,31342109,2015-05-04,166347,Yu,David and Kelly were the best hosts!!! The house was super clean. The private area(bed room and bathroom) was a lot more private than you would imagine.

Can not think of anything bad from this experience...  I wish we could even stay longer!! Highly recommended!!!

They have absolutely everything you could possibly need as a traveller right down to their favourite restaurants. A locals perspective of a destination is always the best and that's exactly what you get from David and Kelly. Things get even better and David and Kelly are some of the most wonderful people I've ever had the chance to get to know. I look forward to visiting again and hope that Velma doesn't chose a new favourite in the meantime!

They (and Velma) both were very friendly and flexible as we arrived really late at at night to a very welcoming home. The room and bathroom are very clean and feels very private. Everything we needed was made easily available. The breakfast they prepared was already a generous offer and Kelly's muffins tasted so yummy. They both made themselves available to answer any questions and offer insider tips on what to see, do, and eat in the area. We felt very comfortable here and would definitely consider staying with them again. Our short weekend stay was a great experience made even better by David and Kelly."

They were incredibly warm and offered great advice for sights to see in Pacific Grove and Big Sur.  The breakfast was delicious and a wonderful start to our days.

Also, they have a map on the wall in the bedroom that shows where all of their guests have been from around the world which is amazing to see. The bathroom is immaculate and has a gorgeous, spacious shower and all the amenities that you can think of. The room feels very private and is on the opposite side of the house from their bedroom so it feels like you have the house to yourself. The breakfast was delicious, featuring homemade muffins and the most delicious coffee, tea and juice. Before leaving, we found ourselves talking to David and Kelly in their kitchen for two hours about our mutual interests and their many amazing hiking trips around the country. They are so much fun, so interesting and so passionate about what they do! We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"

We had such an enjoyable time with them, and hope to get the chance to stay with them again - or even host them in Norway :-) The area is wonderful; quiet and within walking distance to the sites in Monterey/Pacific Grove - including Monterey Bay Aquarium, the walk around the Cannery Road and Lovers Point.

The house was clean and lovely, we had our own bedroom, bathroom and free use of our own living room. The only thing that is shared is the kitchen. Also - extra point for Velma, the cute dog. The room has lots of information brochures and tips for good places to eat, a nice wall with the world map that you get to place your pin on.

Lovely people, lovely place - will strongly recommend David and Kelly to anyone I know that will be traveling close to Monterey Bay."

David and Kelly made us breakfast each morning (yogurt, cereal, fruit, granola, coffee, OJ) and gave us innumerable suggestions about local sights to see. They also let us use their Aquarium guest card, which was a really nice touch. The room was spacious, bright, and cozy with lots of little thoughtful details like brochures on the area and maps of the Bay. It got cold in the night but Kelly made sure we knew where the extra blankets were and we as warm as could be. The bathroom was big and clean and well- supplied. My brother and I really loved staying here, and were we to return to this area, we would absolutely stay again!"

They are warm and gracious hosts. They had great recommendations for kayaking and food. We loved meeting Velma, their adorable and well-behaved dog. We had our own private section of the house and felt that we were able to easily come and go as we pleased. There was plenty offered for us to do inside the house (books to read, a tv to watch, a couch to hang out on) in addition to fun things around the area. The location is great. The breakfast was phenomenal. Kelly's muffins are to die for. We would love to stay again the next time we are in the area."

Thanks for offering the aquarium passes and delicious muffins (even two for ""take out"";)! They also shared their traveling experiences with us and showed us the photos they took!

Everything was just as described and even better: on top of the comfy room and the delicious breakfast we had easy conversations with our hosts and loads of recommendations on what to do and where to go: especially David's advice for the trip to PG and for the journey down Highway 1 enabled us to see a lot of nature and places we probably would have missed. Thank you so much for everything - not to forget the Aquarium passes. I would always come back to this home and hope I will some time.

5860442,39618449,2015-07-25,1885346,Marisa,Kelly and David were such a lovely couple and I wish we could have stayed longer and enjoyed all their wonderful suggestions. The bedroom was very spacious with a super comfortable bed. The bathroom was huge and we had pretty much the whole front of the house to ourselves. Their welcome/local information binder was amazing. They really want you to love the area and have taken the time to put a great guidebook together (the heart of a teacher-Kelly).

The house is very well located in a quiet residential area in Pacific Grove, minutes away from the Monterey aquarium and also minutes away from many nice restaurants in Pacific Grove. The room is not big, but fits two well, and the bathroom is out side the bedroom, it is modern and very spacious. 
I would definitely recommend this house."
5860442,42267985,2015-08-12,1397295,Jacqueline," David made us feel very comfortable and welcome, the neighborhood was easy to find and we appreciated the tickets to the Monterey aquarium.  He made great coffee in the morning and served a lovely breakfast. "
5860442,42439292,2015-08-13,38189610,Christopher,"You can't go wrong staying with David and Kelly - the house is very clean, bed is super comfortable, and the neighborhood is very quaint and close to the downtown district. The entire front of the house is open for guests, and the dedicated bathroom is very modern and clean. Breakfast was also good, and was a great kickstart for our trip down highway 1."
5860442,42658072,2015-08-15,29214013,Catherine,We've been remarkably welcome by David the house is neat and tidy and the breakfast home made was delicious. The aquarium was absolutely fantastic  and Monterey full of surprises for sea lovers. We'd love to come again and stay longer. 
5860442,43026359,2015-08-17,30238720,Lauren,"David and Kelly are wonderful hosts. Before we even arrived and of course while we were there, they shared their wealth of knowledge about things to do right in Pacific Grove and the Monterey area and also gave us great tips based on our driving itinerary to Big Sur and more. David was up with us each morning serving us a delightful breakfast; delicious muffins baked by Kelly, fresh fruit, juice, cereal, granola, yogurt and top notch coffee. Very clean and comfortable accommodations. We felt totally welcomed and at ease during our stay. Better hosts one cannot ask for!"
5860442,43240709,2015-08-18,32367213,Lois,"We had the most amazing stay at David & Kelly's house. They are the true definition of perfect hosts and take great care of everything. We had an extremely warm welcome and they were very flexible concerning the come and go possibilities (own key).

The bedroom and bathroom (actually everything) were extremely clean!!! 

The breakfast was delicious and we had a great conversation with them concerning nature which they are passionate of!

We would definitely book again and recommend to everybody. 

We slept like in our own home."
5860442,43375816,2015-08-19,30030762,Tim,"We really enjoyed the stay with David and Kelly. On the day of arrival we could use the Monterey Aquarium pass which is really worth it. Its the most beautiful aquarium we ve ever seen. Great add-on that guests can use it for free instead of 40 usd per person. The room was very convenient, and the information on the board very useful. Also the 1 pager of recommended sights down south was exceptionally well prepared and very helpful. The neighbourhood was very quiet and safe. David prepared a really nice breakfast for us with muffins and tea and it was so lovely how he prepared the fruits. Velma, their dog is very friendly too :-)
We 100% recommend the stay with David and Kelly and it would be our preferred choice if we come back to Monterey"
5860442,43756404,2015-08-22,32848977,Carolyn,"David and Kelly's home is on a quiet, well-kept street within walking distance (about 7 blocks) of the water. Their home is lovely -- pristine clean and comfortable. Our private quarters were in the front of the house and included a bedroom, large bathroom, living room and adjoining dining room. Our hosts live in the back of the house, so there's lots of privacy. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcome, and we fell in love with David and Kelly's 13-year-old dog, Velma. Our gracious hosts made our stay special with all their personal touches, from a hand-written welcome note, to a fully stocked bathroom, to a notebook full of Pacific Grove history, to chocolates in our room. Breakfast was delicious -- yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals and best of all, Kelly's homemade muffins. YUM. The Monterey Aquarium visitor passes were a treat! We spent hours there mesmerized by what we saw. It is well worth seeing. David had wonderful suggestions for hikes, places to eat, and historical and wildlife sites to see. This was our first time using Airbnb and we're hooked, thanks to David, Kelly -- and Velma. "
5860442,43998933,2015-08-23,40173040,Monique,"David and Kelly were very gracious hosts. They gave us a nice quick tour of the home, and told us cool places we could check out and eat while in Monterey. The breakfast they provided was one of the best parts - fresh, delicious muffins, and coffee from an espresso machine! They were direct, efficient, and gracious. They let us do our thing but made themselves available if we needed help. Very kind people."
5860442,44292029,2015-08-25,28953349,Rosalie,"David and Kelly were very warm and welcoming once we managed to get in. We gave them a two hour window in which we planned to arrive and although we arrived within this time, they were not in. The room was spotless and our own bathroom and facilities were great. They provided information above and beyond and we made good use of their recommendations of the area and aquarium passes (cannot be used on day of checkout). The breakfast was a nice selection of cereal, yogurt and home made muffins. The coffee was good too. They pay close attention to detail and respect privacy too. We felt a little rushed at the end. 10am checkout is quite early and were told at about 9am they would like to start cleaning the room."
5860442,44571543,2015-08-27,17424032,Sophie,"I had a very nice time with David and Kelly who very very welcoming, gave lots of information and obviously enjoy meeting new people and making sure that they have a nice trip. I highly recommend them."

Moreover, both are overwhelmingly caring and always go the extra mile to make you feel at home. The house is clean and tidy, and decorated with love. We highly recommend this airbnb!"
5860442,45281235,2015-09-01,36159180,Maureen,"If you are looking for a cozy room with the perfect hosts and good breakfast, you should spend some time at David and Kellys home. We felt welcome from the first moment on and even though I am not the biggest animal fan, Welma was a pretty cool dog! David and Kelly know a lot about the area and gave us some good advise what we should do and see. Whenever you need something they try to make it work... Even if it is a good cappuccino ;)
I definitely recommend to stay here!"
5860442,45418311,2015-09-02,41296309,Michael,We couldn't have asked for a more welcoming and helpful couple to host us in a great location in Pacific Grove. We thoroughly enjoyed this stop on our tour through California. The house and room are kept immaculately and we got served a great breakfast too! 
5860442,45554046,2015-09-04,32473759,Ben,"Wow! Thank you David and Kelly for letting us stay. Room was great with private lounge area and bathroom. Located on quiet street in neighbourhood but within walking distance to everything, make sure you check out the aquarium! Found street parking no problem. Breakfast served each morning was sensational. David and Kelly very friendly and informative a true asset to pacific grove and air bnb community. Thank you again for everything on our stay :)"
5860442,45776126,2015-09-06,34612145,Connie,"Dave & Kelly were the ""Hostess with the Mostess!""  When we arrived we weren't feeling well & they did all they could to make us feel welcome & feel better. They even located a health clinic for us which we took full advantage of! The bedroom was as pictured and the bed was extremely comfortable!! The rooms were all very clean and we enjoyed the healthy breakfast & of course, Kelly's muffins. I must say visiting the Monterey Aquarium was a real treat & lived up to its reputation.  We were headed south after our two day stay with them & Dave gave us a list of suggested places to visit along the way which we found most helpful!  They are a great couple & so glad we had the good fortune to stay there."
5860442,46284201,2015-09-09,37823958,Arnaud,"Kelly and David are wonderful people. They really made us feel like at home. Their house is very nice and very clean.

The room is very confortable, as the private bathroom.

It was very nice sharing and talking with them. 

David prepared breakfast each morning for us and it was so good. Kelly's muffin is the best ! :)

The location is perfect, you can go to the beach in a 10 min walk. Visiting the aquarium for free is also a great experience :)

Tips : go ans take the boat to see whales, it is just the best experience you can imagine.

We had a great moment, David & Kelly are great hosts !

5860442,46559568,2015-09-11,15448299,Aleks,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at David and Kelly's home. It is obvious that they have gone to great lengths to make guests feel welcome and have plenty of information and recommendations for the area. Their home is in a great location for exploring Monterey and Carmel. The breakfast was delicious, the space was very clean and hospitality was too notch. Our only regret is that we were only there for one night. "
5860442,46579036,2015-09-12,29564458,Sarah,"Joli quartier résidentiel paisible. David et Kelly sont accueillants et donnent de nombreux conseils sur les lieux à ne pas manquer dans la région. Chambre confortable et salle de bain privée spacieuse! Muffins et fruits frais au petit-déjeuner, un must!"
5860442,47108546,2015-09-15,16464000,Doe,"David and Kelly are wonderful hosts. Very welcoming and warm. They gave us a lot of good sight seeing recommendations including a full printout of places to check out when we drove south. Their home is clean, cosy and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was simple and healthful, and oh, Kelly's muffins are so yummilicious! Overall, we had a very pleasant stay and would definitely recommend it to friends. "
5860442,47305836,2015-09-17,43542359,Cole,"Had an AWESOME and AMAZING stay at David, Kelly, and Velma the dog's HOME! It wasn't just a house. It really felt like HOME. They were very welcoming. The house and the instructions to get in was very easy. Parking was no problem, just don't park in front of their next door neighbor's blue house because an elderly person is living there. Went to show how thoughtful David and Kelly were. They're an epitome of how everyone should be living in the world! So unselfishly sharing their beautiful home with a super healthy breakfast that they prepare for you in the morning with homemade muffins (do try inform them at what time you will be waking up) at a very very reasonable price! They are active in the community going to meetings for the good of the city. Stay a couple nights with them and do check out the Monterey Bay Aquarium with free passes which cost $40 per person which is a great deal! Thank you so much for doing Airbnb David and Kelly! I'm so inspired to get my own house and start an airbnb too in which both of you can stay in for free for a couple of nights if you'd like! Felt really blessed to have crossed paths with you sweethearts in life. You're both truly an inspiration. Love you guys! DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED! See you soon David, Kelly, and Velma the most adorable schnauzer I have ever met!"
5860442,47616000,2015-09-21,19668145,Cristina,"Our stay at David and Kelly's was great! The place was as described and had everything we needed. After many nights in different hotels this was a whole other experience: a homely feeling plus all the amenities you can think of. Next to that, David and Kelly provided us with perfect recommendations for the area and our route down south. All in all, highly recommended! "
5860442,48165182,2015-09-24,5206371,Morag,"David was an interesting host, him and Kelly are very passionate and knowledgeable about the area and coastline around Monterey.

Super value stay as the aquarium tickets are included. Definitely recommend staying if you're in the area. Also very quiet and private section of the house next to our own bathroom "

5860442,49643360,2015-10-05,39413252,Yinyin,David was very kind to send me suggestions on my travel plan with many great places. David and Kelly were enthusiastic hosts and try to make our stay very pleasant by presenting welcome cards and detailed introduction of the house. The aquarium guest pass provided made our stay at Monterey a great highlight to the 2-week-trip.  It was definitely worth visiting.

5860442,50431817,2015-10-12,4794827,Sandy,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at David and Kelly’s home.  Our space included a bedroom, living room/dining and bathroom.  We never used the living room since we were out most of the time.  They thought of everything including a flashlight and fan for our bedroom. The breakfasts included cereal, juice, yogurt, muffins and great coffee.

We spent 3 nights there and it would have been better to have spent a 4th night so we could have gone on a kayaking tour.

David and Kelly were great hosts and had lots of information about the area and were kind enough to share it with us.

We highly recommend staying there.

Communication about house logistics were clear and the two cards for a day trip the the aquarium were a total bonus.

The next time I am in the area, I'll definitely be looking into staying at this little gem of a home again."

5860442,52834243,2015-11-02,20570027,Clara,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a relaxing weekend getaway and we definitely picked the right spot. David and Kelly are the most amazing hosts! They considered every single detail to make us feel welcome and comfortable in their home. We were out most of the day but we loved chatting with them in the morning during breakfast—ask them about Kelly's art and their knowledge of the area. Also, Kelly's muffins are to die for!

The neighborhood is quaint and very safe. We stayed over Halloween weekend so there were kids trick-or-treating everywhere! The aquarium is a short drive away, also walkable, and we'd highly recommend visiting it. Pacific Grove/Monterey is a perfect escape from the city life and we hope to visit again soon. Thank you, David and Kelly for everything!"

You're about a 15 min walk to the downtown area where there are nice shops and restaurants.  The bed is extremely comfy and they provide a nice breakfast in the morning.

Only minor complaint was that the wifi was not working during our stay.  Otherwise, a wonderful stay - highly recommended."

I could not have been more pleased with the tidy and cozy home and room that David and Kelly provided to us, or with the two of them who were sweet enough to take the time to learn about us and share some of their travel and life experiences. They provided a wealth of information about Monterey, going beyond what was necessary to make us feel well looked after and comfortable. A highlight of the trip was staying here, thanks again for the hospitality!"
5860442,56528217,2015-12-14,38040038,Susan And Tom,"David and Kelly greeted us when we arrived and showed us around.  I have no worries about our accommodations when I see the guest bathroom is spotless!  They have lots of information about the area as well as the neighboring cities.  As they didn't have anyone checking in after us they allowed us to switch our days to the aquarium which gave us a chance to sightsee beautiful Pebble Beach and Carmel.  We would not hesitate to stay with them again. Oh I almost forgot the delicious breakfast of homemade apple muffins, yogurt, cereal, fruit and various beverages. Thank you David & Kelly!"

5860442,59142391,2016-01-07,16878859,Greg,"Dave and Kelly were very helpful adjusting to my first Airbnb experience. I was entertaining an international guest and our plans changed abruptly due to issues of jet lag and then last minute needs. Before arriving, I received thorough and excellent advice on what to see in the area. Unfortunately it rained both days we were in Monterey and so we slept in rather than spending the morning touring. Although we had a two day stay, we sensed that our hosts wanted us to rise earlier for breakfast and we felt a bit intrusive. Apart from that, the accommodations were adequate. A curtain separated our rooms and living area from Dave and Kelly's area. I was anticipating more privacy, but this represents my first Airbnb experience and don't know what to expect. It was a good value, but next time I will probably choose to spend more to have more privacy. "

We were initially attracted by the Aquarium tickets as that was one of our primary motivations for going to Monterey. David and Kelly suggested several other things we could do and we ended up enjoying, including the 17 mile drive and eating dinner at one of the many places previous guests have recommended. We loved that we could walk to the Aquarium from their home and also stroll along the Bay. We even saw Seal pups!
The house was clean, the breakfast was healthy and we couldn't have asked for a better time. Thanks David and Kelly!"

5860442,63284147,2016-02-21,21619730,Charlie,"Terrific. David and Kelly are incredibly thoughtful and very welcoming hosts. I was initially hesitant to rent a room in house where the host still currently lives (as I've never done it before) but I'm really glad I did.

David and Kelly have a very cozy home and they've thought of nearly everything that their guests would want or could need. Not only are they expert hosts but they are also very savvy when it comes to the outdoors. I would definitely come back again just to get their recommendations on where to go hiking or camping next.

The surrounding area is also great. It is far enough from the downtown for some relaxing quiet but also not so far that you couldn't walk or take a short drive just to get to a bite to eat.

Thanks David & Kelly!"
5860442,63918402,2016-02-28,6064170,Christophe & Thiên-Ly,Nous (un couple avec bébé) avons été chaleureusement accueillis par Kelly et David. Nous n'y avons séjourné qu'une nuit. Cela se voit qu'ils ont l'habitude de recevoir des voyageurs AirBnB. Ils nous ont recommandé plusieurs choses à faire/voir dans les environs.
5860442,64161814,2016-02-29,59227304,Rachel Yon Su,"David and Kelly were amazing hosts, and we were super comfortable with the room they provided! They were always willing to offer any amenities and extra support to make our stay even better!"
5860442,65130549,2016-03-10,11456528,Nicholas,David and Kelly have a beautiful home in a quiet part of town. It's about a 20 minute walk from their house to the local attractions. The aquarium is wonderful. So too is Cannery Row.
5860442,65642141,2016-03-16,26642497,Denise,"David and Kelly greeted us at the door upon our arrival and made us feel immediately welcome in their home.  Accommodations were cozy and well equipped.  

Our hosts went above and beyond, not only providing the advertised yummy homemade muffins and fruit each breakfast, but giving insightful tips about the area and wonderful stories about their myriad outdoor adventures!  

We truly had a wonderful time each day/evening we spent there.  David and Kelly are wonderful, warm hosts!  We'd be delighted to stay again in the future!  Thanks so much for your hospitality during our Anniversary weekend! "
5860442,66424637,2016-03-22,57330649,Bonnie,"When we arrived, neither one was there and I forgot to write down the instructions on how to get the key. I called the cell phone number and Kelly talked me through how to get it so we could get in. When they arrived back home from their walk, they gave us the tour and made us feel welcome. David was a great host in the morning and we were pretty slow some days about finishing breakfast. Kelly was great to talk to when she was around as well. It was like our own private B&B, which was really nice! We enjoyed meeting them and staying with them."
5860442,66526247,2016-03-23,43606462,Elissa,"We highly recommend! Comfortable bed, privacy, great location, kind people and a lovely breakfast. "

5860442,67232651,2016-03-27,1770287,Kate & Bryce,"We had a great time at Kelly and David's house. They were fantastic about communication prior to our arrival. Check in was very easy. These two are the most organized hosts I have ever met. They are professional in every way. We rented both rooms which worked great for two good friends who don't always love to share a bed. The bathroom was large and immaculate (good job Kelly). The beds were warm and comfy with high quality bedding. We loved the yummy breaskfast, the perfect coffee, and of course the fun conversation with out hosts. You will not be disapointed. Oh, and dog lovers will appreciate the sweet old Velma. Would I stay again?? Yes, in  a heartbeat."
5860442,67255452,2016-03-27,62663815,Beibei,"David and Kelly's guest rooms were clean, comfortable and well decorated. They were also very helpful in sharing useful local sightseeing information with us."

Kelly and David were so wonderful from the very start, providing suggestions for places to go and as well as restaurants. They both greeted us upon arrival and Kelly was gracious enough to give us an extensive tour of the home. They had the Aquarium Passes waiting for us and we were able to enjoy the facility that same day. 

Over the course of the next two days, Kelly and David were extremely accommodating. From the wonderful morning breakfast (coffee, yogurt, juice, cereal, homemade muffins, and fruit) to the great conversations we shared in their kitchen (Kelly and I are both teachers) to the fact that they really do respect your privacy and spend a lot of time in the back portion of the house to give you space -- all in all it was truly amazing. I would absolutely recommend this Air B&B to anyone looking for a home away from home. They truly set a high bar for what excellent hosting looks and feels like. "
5860442,68607447,2016-04-05,39662735,Brianne,This was our first airbnb experience. It was a great first experience. Pacific Grove is lovely. Their neighborhood is lovely. Their house is lovely. The guest rooms are lovely. And David and Kelly are lovely people. It felt like we were visiting friends...friends who left a chocolate on our pillow!

Very great experience with them. "
5860442,69935419,2016-04-14,58870709,Charles,"We were warmly welcomed and David provided helpful advice on local attractions.

Everything was immaculate and plenty of instructions, maps, tips for the area etc were provided. Breakfast was fantastic. The hosts were flexible and accommodating with our last minute changes to our aquarium visit. We loved our short stay of 1 night but only wished we had scheduled in more time for this beautiful town."

5860442,73829085,2016-05-10,30795611,Chris,"david and kelly are wonderful hosts! they truly take pride in what they do. they provide excellent information about the area and the house as well. there is a lot of history in monterey and they provide a lot of good reading about it. 

the space is exactly as advertised. the king bed was nice and comfy. we had plenty of space to move about. we had a perfect night sleep after long day of sight seeing cannery row and the aquarium. the passes to the aquarium were great. the aquarium just down the road is one of the best ive been to, i highly recommend going if you go to monterey. 

the breakfast david and kelly provided us with was perfect. yogurt, granola, cereal, homemade muffin, juice, coffee.... it was plentiful and delicious. it was a great hardy meal to kick off the morning. 

we hope to make another trip out to the west coast. david and kelly will definitely be on the list of places to stay :)"
5860442,73917075,2016-05-11,66872789,Dandan,David and Kelly both are very nice.  We heard that David usually prepares breakfast at 8AM. Because we have to leave before 8am. And We told David that we don't want to bother him and we can grab the breakfast on the way. but David still tried to prepare breakfast for us about 7am. We really appreciate it. Kelly's home made muffins are so delicious. 
5860442,75021454,2016-05-18,9379387,Maxime,"David et Kelly sont un formidable couple qui sauront vous mettre à l'aise dans leur maison.

Une adresse à faire !"
5860442,75243459,2016-05-20,13461835,Bill,"David & Kelly are great hosts.  Their attention to detail makes your stay easy and comfortable.  They have an array of great information on things to do (including use of their 2 passes to the Monterrey Aquarium which is why we were in Monterrey) and places to go in the area.  There were a number of books on the area showing places for hikes and even sets of binoculars to borrow.  The two bedrooms are very comfortable and the bathroom were spotlessly clean.

David & Kelly are also very friendly.  They share their house with you in such a way that you have your private space and they have theirs, but there are also a number of common areas (like the kitchen and dining room) where you can get to know them.   Kelly is a great artist and makes each visitor a welcome card as well as little signs around the house giving you tips that make your stay easier.  David made us a delicious breakfast consisting of homemade muffins, Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, juice, cold cereal and coffee/tea.

This is what an Airbnb should be like!!

The room was comfy and cozy, the bed was amazing and we slept like babies...everything we could possible want to know was posted in the room on a cork board,  from the wifi commection info to how to operated the windows!  Everything was easy!!!  The breakfast that Dave put out for us in the morning was great!  The home made muffins was the icing on the cake!!!   We were only there one night, but would go back if we are the area again!!!"

During the short time we were there, the highlight of it all was the continental breakfast, because,  it included fresh and organic produce. Our stay there left a lasting impression, and we look forward to returning soon. "
5860442,77137913,2016-05-30,2788511,Allison,David & Kelly were very welcoming to their home. Everything  you could need was there and the accommodation was exceptionally lclean & comfortable.

5860442,77723865,2016-06-03,39297746,Luis,"I'm a 22 year-old that was traveling with my parents and I must say that this is hands down the most comfortable and enjoyable AirBnb stay I've ever had. David & Kelly were extremely attentive, detail-oriented and personable. A couple of days before our check-in date, David sent us detailed suggestions of stops to make on our road trip along Highway 1 on the way to Pacific Grove. Upon checking out, he also gave us more suggestions for the rest of our road trip. Some of our favorite moments of the entire trip were the stops that David suggested. On the day of check-in, we arrived pretty late at night, but David & Kelly were very accommodating anyways. Both rooms had a cozy queen bed and the restroom was spacious & spotless. The house is pretty much divided into two halves, so you have complete privacy if you want it. David and Kelly are also more than willing to chat and give you suggestions. 

Breakfast was delicious... fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juice and homemade muffins. Parking was not an issue at all. They have a dog, but we didn't see her at all during our stay... she stayed on their half of the house. If you're looking for a comfortable, relaxing place to stay with exceptional hosts, look no further. "
5860442,77817819,2016-06-03,31613271,Siyun,"It was my first time to actually stay a night with Airbnb hosts. Kelly and David' house is located in a tranquil neighborhood, but with easy access to fisherman's wharf. My parents love this house so much, saying it is their ""dream house,"" and even they would definitely refer the design and decor style to their new home. 
Kelly and David are nice and helpful hosts. They made us feel home. Kelly's  homemade muffins tasted so great! We loved the breakfast they served. 
Such a wonderful Airbnb experience! "
5860442,78254193,2016-06-06,29233181,Steve,"David and Kelly are ideal hosts.  They have got every thing that you may need and/or expect from a hotel.  They've got more print-outs on stuff to do on the Monterey peninsula and surrounding area than a typical hotel concierge.  Most of all, they were a pleasure to talk with the few times we interacted on our short stay.   I highly recommend their place to anyone visiting the Monterey area!"
5860442,78588728,2016-06-07,52777805,Minwoo,"This was our first AirBnB stay, and Kelly and David were such great hosts.

My parents loved breakfast that two made for us. I really appreciated their willingness and sincerity. "
5860442,78715291,2016-06-08,12015510,Xiaoxi,"This was an excellent experience.

Super comfortable bed with soft luxurious bedding to an amazing shower and huge bathroom.  They have created a wonderful space for their guests with a whole front living room to enjoy with your own privacy.  

The tourist tips were top notch and the breakfast was pretty awesome... so great that I think I will be making some offerings to my own guests in the future.

The price was a steal and I was very lucky to find an open date for this spot.   Cheers to Dave and Kelly for being such wonderful hosts!"

Before we arrived, they sent us a detailed list of all the sites we should try and stop by on our coastal road trip before arriving at their home. I arrived later than expected to their home and they were flexible and understanding (even though it was beyond their check-in hours). The continental breakfast, with homemade muffins, was such a special touch and their company and stories made my short stay even more pleasant. I highly recommend staying with David and Kelly as their so kind and give a top notch experience all around! "

We would love to stay with David and Kelly again, both for the wonderful set up and because we loved getting to know them! "

We couldn't have asked for a better location or experience. We parked our car and walked everywhere including the Aquarium which was a huge plus for us.
5860442,87545155,2016-07-20,63990396,Myles,"This was our very first AirBNB experience, and David & Kelly ""set the bar very high.""  We were greeted by David upon arrival & he gave us a quick tour of our rooms, the living room, & kitchen.   We then decided to take advantage of the (2) free passes to Monterey Bay Aquarium (world class!), so we did a quick tour (90-minutes, it closed at 6pm).  We at a quick dinner then returned back to David & Kelly's.  Kelly then gave us a tour and introduced us to Velma (a very cute, friendly, ""furry, family-member"").  We slept comfortably that night:  our daughter in her own queen bed, my wife & I in the  2nd bedroom in our  queen bed.  Lotsa pillows, comfortable mattresses, warm comforters & blankets equals a good night's rest.  Waking the next morning...Big suprise! David & Kelly MADE US BREAKFAST!  Fresh espresso-style coffee, hot chocolate, delicious muffins, cereals, greek yogurt, and fresh fruit (artfully arranged by David) was really the ""cherry on the top of the sundae!""  David & Kelly set the table with breakfast goodies and we're going adjourn to the back of their home, but we had such a nice rapport that my wife asked that they join us, they obliged and shared suggestions on things to see & do on our drive South thru Big Sur.   With breakfast done...Our bags packed... We bid David & Kelly a fond Aloha.  Perhaps the only regret...That we didn't stay an additional day with our gracious hosts in their warm and lovely Monterey home."

5860442,88406567,2016-07-24,13126703,Tina,"My boyfriend and I were in Monterey for his birthday celebration. We got to the area an hour earlier than expected, but David and Kelly already got the room ready for us and allowed us to check in early. The house is in a cute and quiet neighborhood, very close to the aquarium. We were greeted with warm welcomes and they even remembered it was Kevin's birthday! Kelly gave us a very thorough tour of the house, including things we might need (water, first aid, etc.) and things we might like (hiking maps, visitor information, etc.). The house is very spacious and clean, and they've done a great job labeling where everything is at. We also met Velma, David and Kelly's 14-year-old Schnauzer who can't really hear anymore but is just as adorable still. Our favorite part of the stay was definitely breakfast. We woke up to fresh fruits, homemade muffins, milk and cereal, yogurt, orange juice, and coffee! All prepared by our lovely hosts. We are so grateful for David and Kelly's hospitality and would definitely return next time we're in town!"

We loved all the recommendations they gave us for nearby hikes and restaurants, and really enjoyed walking the historic area of their neighborhood and seeing the beautifully restored homes from the late 19th/early 20th century. Breakfast was delicious, too!"
5860442,89084321,2016-07-26,15965624,Robin,"Even though I have rented a couple of different places through Airbnb I must say this is best hosts I've had.

Their room is comfortable and you will find useful guidances for you to explore Monterey. You won't believe they provide maps, their personal guidance, and restaurants recommendations from former travelers. In the room and bathroom you will find almost everything that a 5 star hotel will provide. And the breakfast is very fresh. We will definitely recommend their place to guests who travel Monterey. Thanks, David and Kelly. "
5860442,91809529,2016-08-06,53334365,Thomas,This is an excellent Airbnb. David and Kelly have made a real effort to make this an excellent place to stay. They provide all of the usual things expected from a BnB and much more. We were made to feel very welcome and the house is set up wonderfully for us to use with our own private space. They were very accommodating with our rush to use the aquarium passes when we arrived as well. Very much recommended!
5860442,92407112,2016-08-08,40047438,Jim,"We had a wonderful stay with David and Kelly. The house is lovely and extremely clean. There were two beautiful bedrooms and a great bathroom, plus we had our own separate area of the house. The house is extremely conveniently located, very close to the aquarium and other downtown attractions. We made good use of the aquarium passes, which made this Air BnB a great value. Breakfast was terrific and much appreciated. We love this part of the country and look forward to staying with David and Kelly (and Velma!) again in the future. Thanks for a great stay!"

David nous a accueillis et nous a fait découvrir ce logement très agréable et très calme tout à fait adapté à une famille. Kelly avait cuisiné d'excellents muffins pour le petit déjeuner. En effet, un excellent petit déjeuner est offert. Les conseils de David sont également très judicieux !
L'emplacement du logement est top par rapport  aux points d'intérêts. 
Un seul regret, nous sommes restés 1 seule nuit, durée trop courte par rapport à l'intérêt (pour nous) de cette région (aquarium, Pacific Grove, Carmel, 17 mile drive...).
Merci David et Kelly !"

We were warmly greeted with plenty of information about the area, what was available to use in our room, recommendations of things to do and places to eat. 
After enjoying Monterey, we retired back to the house for a refreshing shower and some rest. Everything offered was of high quality: from the comfortable bed which provided a deep sleep, to the nutritious morning breakfast of ripe fruit, delicious homemade muffins, and more. 
It's easy to see the effort David and Kelly put into being attentive and conscientious of anything their guests may need. My partner and I really admire and respect this quality, we will definitely be back if we are ever in Monterey again. Thanks again! "

They really go out of their way to make their home friendly, super-clean, and so comfortable. And yes, Kelly's muffins are deeelicious. Fresh fruit, muffins, coffee, cereal in the morning - like a true Bed & Breakfast. And, the conversation was so comfortable. What great people and top-notch AirBnB hosts.  They provided great information about the area and so, so much more. Thank you both! "
5860442,99159127,2016-09-03,50990162,Laura,"David and Kelly are fab hosts. From their homemade breakfast muffins to all the local tips they offered us for sightseeing and eating, they were on hand when you needed them. We also loved meeting Velma the dog - we were missing our family dog from home as were away on a three week trip, so it was lovely to have some canine interaction! The walk to the Monteray aquarium is not far and is along the beautiful beachfront, and David and Kelly offer you two passes for this (which are brilliant as the entry for the day is $50!) Nearby the centre of Pacific Grove has lots of eating places and feels very comfortable to walk around at night. All in all, would thoroughly recommend!"
5860442,99754916,2016-09-05,33733733,Monika,"David and Kelly were the most friendly and welcoming hosts we met during our three weeks stay in California. They gave us a lot of recommendations what to do and see and they have turned out to be very helpful. It was also the only AirBnB which included breakfast. The room was really nice decorated, the bed luxurious and the bathroom big and clean. We could use a big living room as well as parts of the kitchen. The location is perfect, quite and with a 10 minutes walk to the Center of Pacific Grove with nice restaurants. We definitely recommend to stay here!"

They really impressed us with fantastic suggestions and knowledge of the local area's history and geography , and we used David's suggested itineraries for the rest of our west coast trip. their attention to detail was the best we've seen from an Airbnb! The aquarium tickets were greatly appreciated, and the breakfasts set us up brilliantly each day. 

Thank you both!"

Everything is very clean and the neighborhood is very good and quiet, eben the deers like that. ;) David served a perfekt breakfast and had also some good suggestions for the day.

We stayed 2 nights in Pacific Grove at David and Kelly's home on our way from San Francisco to LA. 
They gave us already great advices of what to see on our way to their house (many thanks for the good restaurant adress in Moss Landing especially :-)))) ). 
And we liked every detail and attention they have for their guests: a welcom card, a list of restaurants, 2 binoculars for the whale watching, home made muffins for breakfast, a list of what to see next,...). 
We enjoyed very very much this house and the kindness and also discrete presence of David and Kelly. 
It was also a perfect place between Monterey and Carmel. 
Many many thanks ! You added definitively good rememberings to our californian holidays :-)))). "

A quiet and safe feeling neighborhood and close to many area attractions.  The bedroom was comfortable and the space was private.  We also greatly enjoyed being able to relax in the front living room space.  The breakfast was tasty especially the delicious homemade muffins and fresh brewed coffee.  David and Kelly were not at all intrusive and allowed us our privacy; however, they were accessible and willing to give great tips on the area.  They were also flexible with us and allowed us to drop by early to pick up aquarium tickets and also prepared breakfast earlier than normal to accommodate our young child induced early morning rising time.  "
5860442,104689167,2016-09-27,47469834,Beate,"This is a very welcoming place to stay. David and Kelley did everything to make us feel comfortable and were sharing their knowledge about the area.

Stayed here one year ago to celebrate my mom, and grandma to celebrate my grandmas 88th birthday and we loved it so much we decided to come back again this year! The location is within walking or jogging distance to the beach, and a ride to Carmel or Monterey.  The home is original and so cozy with wood floors and fluffy comforters; its the perfect amount of privacy but with opportunity to interact with your hosts - which I recommend you do - they are lovely folks and we cant wait to be back next year! "
5860442,110319872,2016-10-25,92310796,Jake,Staying in David and Kelly's home for several days was an absolute delight.  There's no doubt in my mind that we'll be back again!

House and room were lovely, very clean and comfortable. And the bathroom was huge! So luxurious. 

Its a great quiet neighborhood to stop and have a rest and is conveniently located. Just a short drive to necessities and also a short drive to the coast and fun things! Absolutely recommended. "
5860442,112615159,2016-11-06,59338693,Glen,"We pulled up to the house and were pleasantly surprised. The house looked better than the photo and was situated in a beautiful neighborhood. David and Kelly welcomed us with warmth and kindness. They took us to our beautifully furnished bedroom and also showed us the living room that was ours to use exclusively during our stay. We also met their beautiful 15 year dog Velma who just wants to be loved. 
     The house was centrally located for our stay. We walked from the house around the neighborhood, to all of shops and restaurants downtown, and also walked along  the ocean. It is just a short drive to Monterey and Carmel. "

5860442,113421420,2016-11-12,23035659,Veronica,"After arriving a bit later than originally anticipated, we found Kelly and David's home in a quite neighborhood of lovely Pacific Grove.  We enjoyed seeing photos and artwork around the house that reflected their passion for national parks and the environment and enjoyed sharing stories of our travels.  We felt very welcome and enjoyed all of the very special touches that Kelly's put in place to make her visitors feel at home.  We got great recommendations on restaurants, places to visit, and some insight into the local community.  Our experience staying in Pacific Grove was fantastic - had we not been waylaid when we arrived, we also would have loved to enjoy the Monterey Bay Aquarium while we were in town.
We also enjoyed breakfast with Kelly and Dave - especially the homemade muffins and fruit!  We felt spoiled and enjoyed all the attention to detail and guest experience."
5860442,113762511,2016-11-13,8942965,Dayton,"This is the prototypical Airbnb: friendly hosts who put a lot of effort into making sure you have a great stay. David and Kelly were very easy to communicate with, made us a delicious and beautiful continental breakfast, and helped me out when I left a sweater at their house. Besides the aquarium passes, they gave us a number of other great suggestions for what to do and where to eat in Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel. Can't recommend them highly enough. "
5860442,114395753,2016-11-18,1025224,Jason,"Great location in Pacific Grove, about one mile to coast, village and Cannery Row/Monterey Aquarium.  David and Kelly are wonderful hosts and you are truly guests in their home with one door with curtain separating your area with the rest of their home.  They certainly didn't impose on our space other than to provide a good breakfast and when they were leaving/arriving home but people looking for complete privacy may not like it.  They were able to provide great information about the area as they've lived there for decades.  The Aquarium passes worked seamlessly and saved us $60."

Nicely situated in a quiet residential neighborhood a short walking distance from the famed Monterey Aquarium, it made it very easy to spend the day there at our convenience, without worrying about parking.

  Thanks again for making our visit very enjoyable ."
5860442,166574664,2017-07-03,35519253,Daisy,Me and my family had a wonderful time and Kelly and David's home! They made us feel at home with excellent knowledge of places to visit in town. I would highly recommend them to my friends. 
5860442,167133377,2017-07-05,138274413,Alex,"We only stayed for 1 night, but everything was perfect! CLEAN, which was very important to me, well stocked, and home is well maintained. Located in a quiet neighborhood in PG. David and Kelly were attentive without being intrusive, a real skill. With breakfast provided + 2 adult aquarium passes, this place is a fantastic value. "

5860442,170455009,2017-07-15,91968655,Kokor,"非常棒的一次一次体验,David和Kelly非常热情,中途车子出问题了,是Kelly帮我联系的租车公司。房间非常舒服,卫生间也很干净,早上还有热腾腾的咖啡和面包,总之一次非常满意的旅行。"
5860442,171129867,2017-07-16,9690531,Daniel,"It's very clean, authentic and walkable to lots of PG places and the water.  There are many rules, definitely read them beforehand and be prepared, as this can feel a little restrictive."
5860442,171497524,2017-07-17,67997730,Hanmei,"David and Kelly的房间特别干净和舒适,David为我们准备了早餐,这是我们此次美西游唯一一家准备早餐的。
David还为我们打印了推荐目的地的开车路线和地图,非常的nice!"

5860442,172368975,2017-07-20,47854658,Sarah,"Great place and great hosts! Would definitely stay here again if in the area. Communications were fast and clear. Two guest passes to the aquarium, homemade breakfast in the morning, and our host David was great at giving suggestions to where to visit if you are new to the area! The house is clean and quiet, and their dog is so cute! All in all, a wonderful experience staying at David and Kelly's house!"
5860442,172748858,2017-07-21,8117782,Jennyfer,"David & Kelly's place is warm, comfortable and in a great location. We loved going to the aquarium but also loved discovering Pacific Grove. The bedrooms were spacious and clean."
5860442,173536663,2017-07-23,13283656,Laura,"Friendly hosts and knowledgeable of the local area. Despite this being a shared space, they go out of their way to ensure guest privacy on their side of the house. We used the Aquarium passes and were glad we did when we found out the entrance fees are $50! The home was centrally located in a family-friendly neighborhood. Due to the residential area and shared space, this home would not be a fit for rowdy groups or night-owls. Overall great experience and enjoyed having fresh homemade muffins from our hosts with breakfast each morning."
5860442,174091896,2017-07-24,76635045,Susan,Great place and kind family. David and Kelly gave us valuable suggestions about our trip in Camel and provided delicious breakfast. We'd like to live there if we visite Camel again

5860442,178130925,2017-08-04,47111741,Brian,"At our arrival, we realized how convenient this AirBnB was. It was perfectly located in a nice, quiet neighborhood in close proximity to the aquarium as well as Monterey and Carmel by the Sea.

David and Kelly were great hosts and accommodating. They even gave us great tips on things to do nearby and were eager to help. This was the most delightful stay we've ever had at an AirBnB."
5860442,178460088,2017-08-05,74005670,Franziska,Thanks for having us for the night and agreeing to take us in with our three kids. We loved the location and the walk along the waterfront. Wish we had more time to explore the area. Also a big thanks for a great breakfast.

5860442,180551098,2017-08-10,124353438,Yan,"如期入住David&Kelly的家,一幢坐落在安静街区的舒适住宅。不知道为什么,从airbnb的手机APP链接到地图门牌号就搞错了,害我们差点按响了对面一户的门铃,还好Kelly看见了我们,非常顺利的入住了,而且很幸运赶上客卧换了一张新床,David正忙着调试,能感觉到他们为客人做了充足周到的准备。为客人提供的两间卧室以及客厅非常舒适整洁,我们享受了一个宁静夜晚的充足睡眠。早上的早餐虽然简单但很贴心,Kelly亲自做的南瓜muffin甜度刚刚好,松软而不会太甜腻,水果都细致地切片摆盘,橙汁牛奶也都各自配有恰当的器皿。做为中国人的传统是不太习惯让年长的人来为自己服务的,会觉得不太好意思,这大概是我们唯一觉得有点不适应的地方吧。很遗憾离别的时候Kelly不在家,没有跟她道别和致谢。另外我们一行人都英文平平,又只住了匆匆一晚,没能很好地跟David&Kelly交流我们的感受,只能说一声:谢谢,再见。"
5860442,180995633,2017-08-11,6394347,Jennifer,"David and Kelly's place was great! Exactly as described, easy to find, and a great value.  We made use of the aquarium passes and loved that their place was within walking distance of the aquarium! Breakfast in the morning was also a great touch.  Hosts were kind, communicative, and very accommodating.  I definitely recommend!"

5860442,186516627,2017-08-24,146101508,Catherine,This place a gem - exceptionally clean and the host (David) was nothing less than wonderful. We met before check in so we could use the aquarium passes and David gave us a couple of maps and information about the local area. Breakfast in the morning was lovely (home made muffins!) and David gave us some route tips back to San Francisco to make our drive more scenic.
5860442,188818332,2017-08-30,31110530,Jahan,"We had a wonderful stay with David and Kelly. Loved their local tips for the drive down to Monterey and to Big Sur. Very clean home, delicious breakfast, and friendly but respectful hosts! We would recommend them to any friend or family member. "
5860442,189439663,2017-09-01,18472477,Vicki,"We loved our stay at David & Kelly's in Monterey Bay. Their house is lovely and spotlessly clean, with sweet finishing touches. 20 minute walk down to Lover's Point with stunning views of the bay. David & Kelly gave us lots of hints and tips about what to see & where to go which made our time in Monterey Bay great. Would recommend driving down to Point Lobos to watch humpback whales from the beach - fantastic!!"
5860442,190121818,2017-09-03,109643841,Julia,David and Kelly are wonderful hosts who made us feel very welcome from the beginning on.

5860442,191010710,2017-09-05,41741461,Evan,"This is a perfect spot. David and Kelly are great hosts, friendly yet considerate of our privacy. The neighborhood is so peaceful that I felt bad shattering the silence by closing my car door at night. If you plan to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium (and you should), their home is an unbeatable value. We had spent the two days prior to our visit traversing San Francisco on foot, so we weren't in the mood to walk to the waterfront, but if you are so inclined it's less than 10 blocks. If you drive, parking in the commercial district is inexpensive."
5860442,191728991,2017-09-08,27893729,Alf,"David and Kelly's accommodation was very clean and comfortable, they made us very welcome and were both very helpful and informative about what to do and where to go in the area. Alf and Julie. UK."

Perfect location, lovely place, such thoughtful hosts who provided helpful information of the area and key recommendations which we followed for our drive to Big Sur.  Definitely recommend to one and all."

Every time we stay with David and Kelly and every time is is such a joy. They are the nicest hosts - so friendly, conversational, and accommodating. Their little home in Pacific Grove could not be more perfect for a weekend get-away, with comfortable beds, good coffee in the morning, and within walking distance to the ocean. We obviously love it, since we return every year, and are looking forward to returning next October!"
5860442,207772972,2017-10-29,38324338,Dominic,Nice house in Monterey not far from Cannery Row. Aquarium passes really useful and hosts great at telling you the lay of the land. Decent breakfast.
5860442,208519047,2017-11-01,114372264,Bridget,"David and Kelly's place is lovely! The rooms are pleasant (the bed was SO comfy!) and it was nice to be the only boarders. Their bathroom is really nice and the request to limit water is something I plan on on CA with the drought anyways. They provided breakfast and David gave us a lot of good suggestions for things to see as far out as Yosemite and The North coast. Also, the member pass to get into the aquarium (the only limitation being time, since we were only there for one day) also got us a 10% discount at the gift shop :D."
5860442,208953932,2017-11-03,85397788,George,"David and Kelly have a great place. We came to Monterey to visit the aquarium, and the passes were very helpful.

Upon our departure, they even suggested some really scenic routes that we should take to make our trip more memorable. If you are planning to visit the aquarium, they are kind to lend you theirs too. Did I say the muffins are very delicious!"
5860442,213098190,2017-11-19,156799475,Giselle,David and Kelly’s place was awesome. We had a warm welcome and a tour around the place. We were able to hit up the aquarium with the passes they provided. My boyfriend and I️ had a blast and enjoyed walking around Cannery Row. Their home is super close to downtown. We had great conversations and we learned so much about pacific grove and what it has to offer. If you’re wanting to get away this is a great place to stay.
5860442,213377563,2017-11-20,56986029,Amanda,Just great! So nice to have the aquarium passes and they are just a few minutes walk to some amazing views of the best coast!

5860442,230670405,2018-01-28,11674911,Barbara,"David and Kelly's place is a wonderful home in Monterey / the Pacific Grove neighborhood. They are about a 20-minute walk from the aquarium, and their place comes with aquarium passes, which are pretty pricey on their own. Their home is sort of split in half, with the shared kitchen acting as the point of connection. As guests you will have a fair amount of privacy. There is a hallway with two bedrooms and a bathroom, separated by a curtain from a living room and dining area that you use as your own. The dining area connects to the shared kitchen. There's plenty of street parking (no restrictions, no permits necessary) and the neighborhood is clean, quiet, and residential. The house itself is very clean and quiet at night, with no disturbances from the hosts, their well behaved dog, or the neighbors. It's clear that David and Kelly have put a lot of effort into making their home welcoming, which is one of the best parts of this airbnb. They provide a homemade breakfast in the morning and have lots of tips on hand for exploring Monterey as well as the surrounding areas. The bed is supremely comfortable and the area is spacious. This is a perfect place to stay if you're looking for a real home experience with folks who have lived in the area for quite some time. "
5860442,231528863,2018-02-01,17380218,Danielle And Spencer,"This is the best Air BnB experience that I have ever had. David and Kelly were simply amazing hosts and were so thoughtful. Plenty of space to share and beautiful neighborhood. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and were given a house key to come and go. If you are contemplating a place to stay, this one comes at the highest recommendation. We
Loved them."

5860442,234681286,2018-02-13,168616043,Victor,"Two more cordial and helpful hosts one could not ask for. You're taking a room in their actual residence, but it is detached enough to give you your privacy if that is what you want; however, if you are more sociable and want to be regaled by David and Kelly's tips around the town or descriptions of their travels.. This is the place for you! Add us to their large collection of fans from around the world! (Even though in our case, we just happen to be from over the hill in San Jose)"
5860442,235183645,2018-02-15,88680643,Yunhai,"It's a cozy, clean and comfort house which is less than 10 mins way drive to 17 miles and Monterey Bay Aquarium.

Of course we took full advantage of their guest passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and loved being served a delicious spread for breakfast each morning!  We'll see you again David and Kelly next time we are in town.  Thanks again!"
5860442,242384079,2018-03-11,6379349,William,"David and Kelly were great hosts and gave us helpful tips like where to park for free nearby the aquarium. Their breakfast in the morning was delicious and filling. The only issue we had was the WiFi was a bit sluggish at times, but there are two guest networks to switch from. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and enjoyed their hospitality."
5860442,243147858,2018-03-14,22551844,Som,David and Kelly's house is a perfect little stay for visitors keen on exploring the beauty of the Pacific Grove and Monterey Bay. The house is up a big hill that is a short walk to the ocean and the aquarium. David recommended I take a scenic route down to the aquarium that passed a harbor seal beach that I took every day!
5860442,243972167,2018-03-17,51598828,Elisabeth,"We had a great stay at David and Kellys! They were wonderful hosts both before and once we arrived at their home. Some highlights: plenty of local tips, tasty breakfast, passes to the aquarium, and comfy beds. It was a perfect launching point for our Monterey Bay adventure. We easily visited the aquarium, 17 mile drive, and Point Lobos in our day long stay."
5860442,244842539,2018-03-19,114871215,Mary,Really enjoyed our stay thanks Dave and Kelly for great Hospitality for  Pacific Grove great location

They are very professional, knowledegable, friendly, organize, helpful and hospitable. They have all information we need to know. There are instruction everywhere in the house so we can follow properly. The house is super tidy and clean. I will definitely recomend this place to people and  I probably want to come back."
5860442,245308467,2018-03-21,10263471,Brendan,"Great spot, lovely hosts!"
5860442,246618053,2018-03-25,89761355,Jason,"As being first time BnB people we were blown away by David and Kelly's communication and how they accommodated any needs we had. When we arrived to their beautiful home we were quickly greeted by David and shown around. The room, bathroom and the rest of the house were very well kept and clean. Tons of information on loc as l things to do and the passes to the aquarium were a hit. I highly recommend staying with them and we look forward to booking with them again."
5860442,246988702,2018-03-26,179685092,Reed,Perfect stay! David and Kelly are amazing hosts and provide everything you could need for the perfect trip. They are both very kind and knowledgeable about the area. Breakfast in the morning was delicious and we appreciate all of their hospitality! 10/10 Experience and I would most definitely recommend their home to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Pacific Grove / Monterey area.
5860442,247243004,2018-03-27,142715264,Taylor,"Kelly and David were amazing hosts! There home is beautiful, very clean, and the guest area felt very private. They provided great local tips and suggestions for not only their area, but also along the entire coast. The aquarium passes were definitely worth it! They prepared an amazing breakfast with great muffins and conversation. Would love to stay again!"
5860442,247513197,2018-03-28,158786430,Winnie,Great cozy house. Clean everywhere. Very consider host. Remember come to claim the aquarium pass at the check in day. We have to pay for ours since we only stay for one night and we check in at 7pm.
5860442,248122225,2018-03-30,11701111,Claire,"We had a wonderful time staying with David and Kelly and cannot say enough about their generous hospitality and thoughtful insider tips for touring around. We have an energetic toddler as well that David and Kelly warmly welcomed...and accounted for in their travel advice! Kelly has the neatest illustrated notes throughout their place, which are a delight to discover. Already looking forward to booking our next trip!"
5860442,248565972,2018-03-31,52827170,Pauli,"Such a nice stay. Choose this, you will not be disappointed."
5860442,249145568,2018-04-01,91540386,Renee,"Very clean and comfortable space!  David and Kelly are inviting, fun to talk to, excellent recommendations,  and provide a super breakfast!! Highly recommend!"
5860442,249758965,2018-04-02,18286140,Celia,David and Kelly made our stay here very special. I love their attention to detail and absolutely enjoyed the beautiful hand written welcome card on the desk when we arrived. We also took advantage of the aquarium passes which is a huge perk! The aquarium is a good 20-min walk away and the views by the water are breathtaking. We also stayed for breakfast in the morning which was delicious. Thank you for your hospitality :)
5860442,250069127,2018-04-03,1841262,Vivian,Honestly it wasn’t quite a pleasant experience cause we arrived late at night due to some changes on the way. And I thought the room can be self checked in just like other ones I booked in Airbnb but it wasn’t. The consequence is we didn’t feel welcomed at all. But I still feel appreciated for those hand writing welcome cards and homemade breakfast by David. Rooms are good and location is nice. Except for the door couldn’t be locked inside.
5860442,251328836,2018-04-07,20891881,Thomas,"Lovely people, lovely spot.  David and Kelly are very warm & interesting people.  People you'd be happy to know in any connection.  Ideal hosts. 
Great communicators. Place is easy on the eyes, spotless, comfortable. Great location for me:  I was at a conference at Asilomar.  Tasty breakfasts.   They were considerate and obliging:  One day when it was raining, David kindly gave me a ride to the conference center  -- I was car-less for my stay -- , & Kelly offered to come and pick me up another day it rained.  They also went out of their way to make breakfast early for me on a couple days when my schedule required it.    A pleasure to meet people like Kelly and David."
6018499,30177837,2015-04-18,6755783,Ran,"Marianne was great. She was super speedy replying to our inquiries and messages and took great care to make sure our stay is a comfortable one. 
The house is great. The views from the second floor where the master bedroom and family room and deck are is spectacular with a full panorama of the bay. 
it's very close to Cannery Row and the aquarium and is well stocked with anything you need in the kitchen.
Overall we had a great time."
6018499,30827716,2015-04-27,7323237,Chris,"We stayed at Mrianne`s place for 2 nights and had a blast. I think it was the first time Marianne hosted at this location, and everything looked brand-new and sparkling clean, the house is in a great location, easy drive to Carmel (only 2 min from 17-mile drive) and walking into Monterey. Lighthouse Ave nearby for food and drink as well.
We were super happy to find some breakfast stuff, very sweet and a nice touch. No problems at all with Wifi or anything, easy to find key and find everything around the house. Great communication when booking. Highly recommended."
6018499,31482247,2015-05-05,466476,Bee,"We loved our stay at the cottage! Marianne's Pacific Grove home is just perfect for an oceanside getaway. We loved the sweet patio and garden, and the view from the bedroom and family room. The kitchen was stocked with absolutely everything we could possibly need and the neighborhood was lovely and quiet.  I hope we can return again soon, thank you so very much Marianne!"
6018499,31802201,2015-05-10,466476,Bee,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6018499,32628713,2015-05-19,466476,Bee,"If you get the chance to stay at the ocean view cottage in Pacific Grove, you will enjoy the peaceful location, the gorgeous views across the bay, sweet birdsong from the garden, and of course the wonderful energy of the house itself. We count ourselves lucky to have spent some time here, and plan to return often!

Thanks Marianne!"
6018499,33123943,2015-05-25,17734892,Tony,"We had a pleasant stay at Marianne's place in Pacific Grove. It is a cute place with a nice deck and view of monterey bay. She was a great host and made our stay very comfortable. We were also appreciative of her flexibility.  The only bummer was that one of the bedrooms is really small and the bed was a single with a trundle so one couple had to sleep in separate beds.  At the time of booking, we were not aware as there were no pictures and it wasn't mentioned.  All in all it was a great trip and would recommend staying there if it fits your accommodation needs."
6018499,34958644,2015-06-14,13973223,Gabrielle,"This is a great place to stay - beautiful balcony and a super cozy feel all around.  I love running along the water and this place was only 4ish blocks away (also super close to Pavel's which has cheap and delicious pastries).  If you stay here, definitely cut out some time to frolic by the water and enjoy the view.  Marianne was very quick to respond to all of the questions that I had and check in/out was very easy.  "
6018499,41945452,2015-08-10,11737288,Graham,"We really enjoyed our time here! The house is lovely - really homely, very clean and comfortable, and with everything you need for a great stay. Appreciated the outdoor spaces too. The location is superb - in a quiet neighbourhood, yet within walking distance of all the restaurants and shops in Pacific Grove, the ocean and aquarium. Marianne was great to deal with, and made it all very easy. Would definitely recommend, and would love to return ourselves one day! "
6018499,43028829,2015-08-17,31530663,Lawrence,Listing as described.  Very nice house in a good location.  Lovely TV/Reading room with a great deck overlooking the Bay.  Would highly recommend.
6018499,44959895,2015-08-30,34133245,Kirsten,Beautiful home with a great view of Monterey bay in a nice quiet neighborhood. Very clean and well maintained. Look forward to visiting again!
6018499,45964709,2015-09-07,2149142,Daniela,"Very nice, well-equipped, clean house in a good location.  It's self check-in/out, which I greatly prefer since you don't have to worry about the logistics of meeting up with someone.  Wifi connectivity is always important to us, and the connection was great.

The second bedroom is much smaller than the upstairs master suite, and located on the first floor, on the other side of the house than the master.  It's good for parties where the person/people who are staying in the smaller bedroom wouldn't mind that it's a much more modest room, and would appreciate their own space.  

Host is easy to communicate with, quick/prompt replies to all questions.

The only downside is the upstairs bed--the mattress isn't top-notch, if your partner shifts in bed, you'll feel it too.  But it's firm and certainly serviceable."
6018499,46759010,2015-09-13,20134183,John,"Marianne was very accommodating and made our stay completely hassle-free. The house is in an excellent location, walking distance to the ocean and shops. For the pacific grove triathlon it was perfect."
6018499,47801091,2015-09-21,8991943,Alfred,"Anytime I head back to Monterey, this will definitely be the place I stay at. Prime location, wonderful neighbor hood, lovely place, and a nice view and great smell of the ocean. Marianne also answered any questions I had very quickly which was nice."
6018499,48487065,2015-09-26,27177444,Robert Scott,"My wife & I stayed here for 2 nights as part of our 2 week road trip around California. The place was great. Very much in the mould of an idilic seafront home, although it's not quite on the seafront. The views of the ocean & the bay are wonderful from several different rooms in the house. The house is comfortable and quiet & fully equipped for a very pleasant stay. It's a tiny bit dated in terms of the decor but we quite liked that, it added to it's charm… much like Monterey itself. It's in a good location & easy to access everything the area has to offer. "
6018499,48680276,2015-09-28,15553122,Maree,"Marianne's home is in a great position, easy walk to beach, supermarket and restaurants. The house is just as advertised, spotlessly clean, plenty of street parking available and a quiet neighbourhood. Although we did not get to meet marianne her response via email to our questions was immediate. Thank you for hosting us marianne we had a wonderful 2 days . I would recommend marianne's home to anyone visiting pacific grove."
6018499,50335438,2015-10-11,40709018,Jordan,"It was a pleasure staying at Marianne’s cottage.  The cottage was very comfortable.  It has sunny rooms, a spacious common area upstairs, and a well-appointed kitchen.  It is plenty of space for a family of 4 or two couples.  The location is very convenient for walking to downtown Pacific Grove or the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

Marianne is a great host.  She was very responsive and informative, but not at all intrusive.  All of my interactions with Marianne were very positive and helpful.  The entire experience was flawless.

Cheers!

Jordan

6018499,52271668,2015-10-27,1828415,Jonathan,"The cottage was perfect. Expansive ceilings, great light, beautiful views, chef's kitchen. There were ""helpful hints"" posted discretely throughout which were truly helpful and thoughtful. A bottle of white wine and some bagels fit the mornings awaited us on arrival. Pacific Grove is a great neighborhood too. Lovers Point was the perfect beach. The restaurants and seafood nearby were outstanding."
6018499,53372521,2015-11-08,5254540,Rachel,"This cottage was great! Pacific Grove is a wonderful community and more ""laid back"" than the ""hustle and bustle"" of Monterey - not necessarily the biggest city of course, just more of a city. The home was well stocked with plenty of sleeping arrangement options. Check in and out was simple and Marianne was responsive and accommodating (allowed us extra time to check out). A bottle of wine and muffins were there upon our arrival. the upper floor was our favorite, with a fire place, deck, amazing views, comfy chairs.... wifi was good. we never used the televisions or cooking appliances, but the fridge, coffee maker, dishes, etc. were all sufficient for sure! Thanks Marianne for a great place - we will definitely keep it in mind and recommend it for next time!!!"
6018499,54299546,2015-11-17,1828415,Jonathan,"Our family enjoyed Pacific Grove and the house so much we came back a few weekends later for a repeat visit. Thanks, Marianne."
6018499,70282491,2016-04-17,17409847,Sarah,"We loved out stay in Marianne's house. The place was very well equipped and clean. Everything was ready for us to enjoy our time there plus some thoughtful little things like a bottle of wine, orange juice and coffee. 
Nice location, we were able to walk to downtown and to the aquarium. We even saw a harbor seal give birth to the cutest little thing on our way there!"
6018499,71289042,2016-04-24,5067598,Anne-Lise,"Marianne was a great host, she had left scones for breakfast and a bottle of wine. It was so nice. Her place is amazingly well located and we had a great time."

6018499,73377188,2016-05-08,60505778,Cyrene,"Location was great and the view of the ocean was amazing. The welcome gift was a nice touch. Marianne was especially helpful when the coffee machine didn't work and was able to provide a backup, which was great! Thanks again for letting us stay at your place. We had a great time."

"
6018499,94161327,2016-08-15,48622178,Janice,The listing was 100% accurate with the exception of the bed configuration.  It said 3 beds but only 2 are in rooms that are suitable to live in. It was a beautiful beach cottage and the kitchen was the best of any Airbnb we had ever stayed at.  More info on the garbage would have been appreciated.  We are not from California so we are not aware of the garbage/recycling guidelines.
6018499,96430095,2016-08-22,56612079,Brett,Fabulous stay and the house was super cute and charming!

6018499,99805021,2016-09-06,88048457,Lauren,"Loved our stay at this place! Location was great and convenient to both downtown Pacific Grove and Cannery Row. This place fit five adults comfortably, giving everyone enough personal space while still maintaining the quaint cottage feel. Both deck spaces are also lovely. Additionally, Marianne was super responsive and helpful when needed! I'd recommend this listing to anyone who's looking for a place to stay in the area.

(For those that are confused by the amount of beds, the listing is true to word. There's a queen in the master, and a day bed with a pullout trundle. Additionally, there's also a sofa bed, so four beds total. Five adults were able to sleep on each of these beds. Hope that helps clarify things!)"
6018499,101144636,2016-09-12,72947822,LeeAnne,"I loved this cozy yellow cottage.  The welcoming bottle of wine was a nice treat after a long drive.  There was a view of the ocean from every window upstairs.  We enjoyed relaxing on the deck. and enjoying the view.  The furnishings to this house were very attractive and the kitchen had great appliances, things like 2 coffee (Website hidden by Airbnb) a Keurig and one regular.   The house was perfect for a romantic getaway. "
6018499,102643476,2016-09-18,79987652,Andrew,Lovely house in a nice quiet area. A few shops and restaurants within walking dustance. The house was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Would recommend it.
6018499,106969847,2016-10-09,64128848,Michele,"The house is really cozy, and yet spacious for a family of four. With possibilities to retreat, if you wanted some space on your own. The kitchen is well stocked and the oceanview is great. Be prepared to see deer inthe street! We thought that was great!
The location is ideal, close to Pacific Grove and Monterey center. And yet, you're in a residential area, nice and quiet. "
6018499,107485927,2016-10-10,5689853,Ching,We decided to go on a weekend getaway on a whim.  Marianne was very responsive and got back to me within minutes regarding availability.  Very kid friendly cottage.  We loved the view from the deck.  The location can't be beat.  
6018499,109001116,2016-10-18,92947721,Paul,We recommend Marianne's house in Monterey it was perfect for our family of four. It was nice and quiet and relaxing.  My wife enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and was a close walk to the beach. Marianne was a superb host responding to anything we had a question about immediately. 
6018499,113761699,2016-11-13,33610106,Ernesto,Marianne made it easy with simple instructions throughout the house and fully stocked kitchen was great! Enjoyed staying there and it's in the best part of pacific grove/Monterey area.

It is walking distance to a great path on the coast and to many restaruants and shops. We walked to brunch on one of our days. In addition, the house is very clean and comfortable. Plus, Marianne is a very communicative host and gives you everything you need! 

Tip: Wake up to see the sunrise on the deck! it is great! "
6018499,156241292,2017-05-29,45566537,Kathleen,"Easily walking distance to downtown pacific grove and lovers point, this home was homey and very cute. Has blowdryer, blenders, waffle iron, all sorts of cooking spices. Marianne is an extremely responsive host and I definitely recommend!"

6018499,159839642,2017-06-11,13633419,Anastasia,"My family and I stayed in Marianne's house for a weekend. It's a charming house with lots of light and fantastic views of the ocean. The location is superb -  you are in a walking distance to the downtown and the waterfront. Marianne was an attentive host, and our stay  was a pleasant experience. "
6018499,161839724,2017-06-18,81329353,Connie,"Marianne's home was a great place to stay. The house is in a quiet & very nice neighborhood with a beautiful view of the bay which is just a short distance of a walk to enjoy. For two couples you each have your own room & bathroom. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals. Beds are comfy and all is clean and tidy. The bedroom up stairs has the gueen bed and is spacious. The bedroom downstairs has a single & a trundle single which makes the room VERY small but, the beds are comfy & you do have room to get in & out which is just fine! All in all, we all would recommend Marianne's place an EXCELLENT place to stay!

6018499,169229453,2017-07-11,1102835,Jenna,We enjoyed our stay in Pacific Grove and had such an easy and straight forward experience with Marianne. Her responses were quick and she even accommodated us at the last minute when we needed to bring our son unexpectedly. I would definitely choose to stay here again! 
6018499,178110361,2017-08-04,9895093,Daniela,"We had a wonderful stay. We were 3 adults and a 15 month old and we were very comfortable. The location is fantastic, you can walk pretty much anywhere you'd want to go in PG and Monterrey Bay Aquarium is a short walk away. The kitchen is incredibly well stocked if you want to prepare a meal and enjoy it at the dining table in the backyard. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
6018499,179156458,2017-08-06,5374765,Dolly,"This beautiful cottage is just as the photos (Website hidden by Airbnb) even better.

Love the detail of the bottle of wine left for us. Definitely would stay again."
6018499,180950854,2017-08-11,12434172,Hobart,"The house exceeded our expectations.

The house was spacious and the lighting was very good.  The two bedrooms were really useful for 3 adults and 2 toddlers.

We found the location super convenient.  It was a quick drive to the cannery / aquarium area (and grocery store) yet it was in a nice and quiet neighborhood.  While it wasn't super close to the beach the second floor had a nice deck to enjoy the breeze and ocean view.

The house was quite well stocked. There was a lot of kitchenware and basic supplies (e.g. condiments) in the kitchen. I also liked that there was a backyard with a weber grill although we didn't get a chance to use it. There were also boardgames and many CDs / DVDs.

Finally, we had left our son's blanket there; Marianne went above and beyond and looked for it as soon as possible and offered to mail it back to hour home and pay for shipping.

Overall the place and experience was great.  We would stay there again."
6018499,190707289,2017-09-04,28198263,Sakshi,"Marianne's house is lovely! Her kitchen is well stocked, her house is very accessible and close to the ocean, she was accurate about listing bed spaces, and provided a very comfortable home for my family to stay in. For our stay she didn't leave a breakfast for us but did leave us a bottle of wine - a very sweet gesture!

The house is a little dusty (windows & deck) but that's to be expected from a large house. Other than that our stay wad flawless!"
6018499,192650935,2017-09-10,13202687,Ashleigh,Nice place. Good location. Good for a family and single adults. Second room a bit tight. 
6018499,199402484,2017-10-01,15918139,Nan Yu,"地理位置非常棒,去各景点都非常便利,房子上下两层,空间精致,布置温馨,可以体验到很好的家庭氛围,露台上可以看到迷人的海景,除淋浴设施有点年份外其他都很好。"
6018499,205025689,2017-10-20,24386540,Sylvia,"The house is in a quiet neighborhood,  easy walking distance of many cute cafes, shops, and lovely views. It is a great location and the host is very quick to respond to any questions."
6018499,205813430,2017-10-22,148080450,Emily,"Had a great time at Marianne's place! Her place is very cute and close to the main strip in Monterey, as well as Lover's Point/the ocean. My friends and I had a very nice getaway weekend here. Everything was exactly as described in the listing."
6018499,209667985,2017-11-05,36967722,Joni,"The location of this charming home was absolutely perfect.  Pacific Grove, Cannery Row, Monterey Bay, the city of Monterey, 17-mile drive, the Butterflies - just to name a few.  All are close by attractions, all full of history, restaurants, shopping, and entertainment.  The view of the bay is underestimated by the photos.  Beautiful area!"
6410088,36438629,2015-06-28,35438082,Bob,"This is my first Airbnb and we rented this for a family of 6 so I did not know what to expect. We were very pleased and had a wonderful time in this large Pacific Grove house in a quaint quiet neighborhood. First, Ahnalisa was very welcoming and helpful with tips on the house and area. This set a comfortable tone for us staying in her beautiful home. The house is nicely decorated and has a spacious downstairs for breakfast, dinner and entertaining. The backyard has a gas BBQ and plenty of seating situated near a fire pit for outdoor conversation. The upstairs bedrooms were large and comfortable. The Airbnb photos do not do this house justice, Ahnilisa's home is much nicer in person. I would highly recommend this house to anyone and plan on staying here again in the future!  Best, Bob"
6410088,39296984,2015-07-22,35727057,Jim,"The home is just as it appears in the pictures - nicely decorated, comfortable and just right for our family gathering of 8 people.  This was my first time using Airbnb and Ahnalisa was the perfect hostess, not only in regard to the home, but working with Airbnb.  Would definitely recommend."
6410088,39851476,2015-07-26,32715974,Michael,"Everything was fantastic when we arrived. There were fresh towels on the beds, several shelves cleared out in the fridge, etc. Ahnalisa went above and beyond to make the house ready for our stay."
6410088,40603318,2015-08-01,12030465,Bridget,A beautiful family home in a lovely neighbourhood. Spacious and well stocked - very comfortable.
6410088,43071701,2015-08-17,36063740,William,"An absolutely fantastic stay!  We (two couples) stayed at Ahnalisa's Pacific Grove home for Car Week, and it could not have been a better stay.  Everything was perfect at the home (I won't just call it a house), from the bed linens and towels to the exceedingly well stocked kitchen.  I've stayed at a lot of different homes through (Hidden by Airbnb) in Canada, the US and Europe, and this was by far the best in terms of quality of kitchen make-up.  The outdoor living area was used by our wives, and they loved it out there in the morning.  The home has a very cozy feel, and Ahanalisa did everything possible to make us feel at home.  I can't recommend this owner enough.  Also, as an aside, the home must be made of concrete, as it was a perfect temperature inside every day, and we did not hear a single creak as we walked around.  I just want to point this out as I've stayed in other homes where one has to walk quietly to prevent waking the entire house in the morning.  Not an issue here, which is very nice when you're staying with another couple.  Thanks so much Ahnalisa!  "
6410088,48325728,2015-09-25,9422997,Rick,"I arranged this rental for a group out-of-town performers whom I had engaged to entertain for a corporate program.  I did not stay at the property myself, but those that did enjoyed it.  It fit our needs and was in close proximity to the venues.  The host was gracious and accommodating and her family home was welcoming and nicely appointed."
6410088,50285477,2015-10-11,30298285,Stephanie,"Ahnalisa was an absolutely wonderful host, and her home is just as lovely as it looks in the pictures online. We stayed here with my parents, my two children, and my dog, and the house was large enough that we all had plenty of room to spread out. The entire house is spotless and the beds are very comfortable. My favorite parts were the hot tub in the backyard and the close proximity to the beach. "
6410088,53451296,2015-11-09,1764740,Courtney,"We had a great experience staying at Santa Cruz Adventure.  It was a lovely house on a quiet road, just as the pictures and description described.  Ahnalisa was very responsive to all my inquiries and even told us about a great beach that allows dogs that was just a short walk away from the house.  Highly recommend.  "
6410088,55190075,2015-11-29,38707428,Albert,"Ahnalisa is a person of uncommon generosity and hospitality. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. Communication was easy and this was during Thanksgiving weekend when SHE herself was on vacation. Her home is in a great location that made exploring the area easy. The house fit 6 adults, 2 toddlers and 1 baby quite comfortably. All my guests were impressed!"
6410088,62637859,2016-02-15,1710665,David,"The neighborhood was beautiful, picturesque and the home was centrally located. The house was warm, welcoming, beautifully decorated and it felt as if though I was at a friends house. The house was very comfortable and the hostess communicated thoroughly before, during and after my stay. The Home was beautiful and fully stocked with linens/towels,comfy pillows/beds, wifi, firepit/fireplace, a hot tub and the home was lovely in general. I cannot wait to go back. The house was even better than expected/"
6410088,63154600,2016-02-21,24795543,Benjamin,We had a fantastic stay while golfing throughout Monterey. Ahnalisa was extremely helpful from the beginning and went above and beyond in ensuring this was a memorable trip. Her house comfortably slept four grown men and had all accommodations necessary. When we travel back again in the future I will look to stay here once more. 
6410088,63814057,2016-02-27,17704980,Brian Cappy,"Ahnalisa made everything incredibly easy for all. She checked in to make sure we were pleased and settled safely into her beautiful home. The kitchen is incredible - a perfect place for a beautiful dinner in. 
The entire process was perfectly smooth and I can't recommend this place enough. "
6410088,66742703,2016-03-24,4104564,Summer,"The home is warm, welcoming, and excellently located. As this is the family's primary residence, it has everything you need for a confort stay. Thank you, Ahnalisa!"
6410088,71540063,2016-04-26,41080740,Craig,"Great stay for the Big Sur Marathon and sightseeing.  The house had all of the amenities you need to live just like home.  It's just a short drive to anywhere you want to go...Big Sur, Monterey Bay, grocery stores, etc.  It's even less than a mile walk to the coast (as long as you don't mind the hill!).  Definitely recommended."
6410088,85531560,2016-07-11,33468657,Janette,This is a lovely neighborhood in Pacific Grove!  Easy walk to downtown restaurants and shops. My six year old granddaughter and her dad walked to the asilomar lighthouse and tide pools so it's not that far.  Ahnalisa was very responsive to a couple of minor issues and came herself to make sure all was going smoothly. We had a delightful conversation.  I felt very comfortable here!  
6410088,89440621,2016-07-28,18747560,Matt,"We had an excellent stay here for our family vacation (8 adults + 1 baby).  The house is beautifully appointed with excellent indoor and outdoor living spaces.  The host was responsive and did a great job making the check-in process easy.  Very good location in Pacific Grove, just a 2-3 minute car ride to the main shopping/dining areas and within walking distance to the coastline and parks, etc.  "
6410088,92328459,2016-08-08,33201860,Im,"The house is beautiful, the area with shops is cute and quaint, the walk to the beach is a nice stroll a little far for our little ones but we didn't mind driving as there's plenty of parking. Would definitely stay there again. Ahnalisa was great, quick to response, and very thoughtful. "
6410088,99933936,2016-09-06,79873689,Krista,"Wonderful stay at this comfortable, conveniently located home.  Ahnalisa was a great hostess,  easy to communicate with and made us feel welcome in her home!  She had the hottub and grill ready as promised which were wonderful after a day of surfing and diving.  Her binder detailing the home made our stay effortless.  Great, quiet and friendly neighborhood, close to everything.  Would definitely recommend to friends!"
6410088,101013047,2016-09-11,82408509,Tabitha,"Amazing home! The pictures do not do it justice! Every room had a different style and such amazing pieces throughout the house, we seen a new interesting item every time we looked. The host was great, very responsive and took care of every detail. Home was large enough for a big family and allowed everyone their own space. "
6410088,103818302,2016-09-24,15439569,Diane,"We loved our stay at Ahnalisa's beautiful home ""Walk to Asilomar.""  The house was warm and inviting, just like all our communications with her prior to arriving.  There were 6 of us and we never felt crowded in her beautiful home, the two and a half bathrooms helped!  The location was a perfect starting point for bicycling the 17 mile Drive, we also did a cycling round-trip to Moss Landing for lunch at Phil's Snack Shack & Deli; kayaking; and hiking at Point Lobos.  A perfect vacation, thank you Ahnalisa!!"
6410088,105695139,2016-10-02,16072828,Danielle,"Ahnalisa's home was absolutely beautiful! It was very clean & spacious - the kitchen was fully stocked, beds were comfortable and the patio/jacuzzi overlooking the stars was just what we needed.  KK the cat outside was adorable and such a love.  The house was in the perfect location - close proximity to downtown Pacific Grove, Lover's Point and 17 Mile Drive.  Ahnalisa was very responsive.  I would highly recommend Ahnalisa and her home to my family & friends!"
6410088,115732473,2016-11-26,78301778,Amy,This house is in a fantastic location in Pacific Grove.  It's in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to the beach.  It's also not too far from downtown Monterey.  The house is very warm and inviting - a perfect getaway for a family vacation.  Ahnalisa is a very attentive host who made sure that we had everything we needed for our stay. 
6410088,122940134,2016-12-26,23301756,Zeribe,"Constantly checked up on us prior, during and after our stay."
6410088,124796581,2017-01-02,30441859,Danielle,"This house is perfect for a group with ample living space and a large fully stocked kitchen. We didn't spend too much time outside because of the weather, but the outdoor living area is very peaceful as well. It's a short walk to the beach, and the aquarium is close by (it's a must see!) Ahnalisa is a great host and promptly responded to any questions I had before and during the trip. "
6410088,131602302,2017-02-12,111048139,Matt,Quiet neighborhood and comfy home.  Great backyard space for grilling and lounging.  
6410088,135692790,2017-03-05,15520923,Shannon,This place RULES!
6410088,153804715,2017-05-21,63099232,Carla,Nice house and enjoyed the location that we could walk to the downtown area. 
6410088,158844083,2017-06-08,133149692,Myles,Stayed with 3 other people for a business trip. The house itself had plenty of room for the four of us and the location was right next to a variety dinner locations. If I have to stay down in Monterey again I will definitely be seeing if this location is available.
6410088,159818056,2017-06-11,97314164,Randy,"Very cozy home.  Very close to several beaches and a short drive to Cannery Row, Carmel Beach, and Fisherman's wharf.  

The home is well stocked and have all of the tools to entertain a group.  Nothing was difficult to find and the overall stay was very comfortable and worry-free.  Ahnalisa was very accommodating and communicated often to ensure that everything was flowing smoothly."
6410088,163847953,2017-06-25,31161562,Paula,The home is comfortable;  a lived in vibe. This is the owners primary residence and it feels as if your staying with a family but the family is not there. Beds are very comfortable. Backyard was nicely furnished but it had lots of kitty waste and was bit stinky. Not what I expect when paying over $600 a night. It was a nice place but not worth the price. 
6410088,166073508,2017-07-02,28896937,Andrew,Wonderful weekend stay at this AirBNB!
6410088,166766019,2017-07-04,50422393,Nicholas,A nice place to stay.
6410088,168589932,2017-07-09,127521409,Stephen,"Fantastic home on a quiet street, walkably close to the beach and just minutes from Monterey. Perfect for any larger group, whether you want to go out more or just stay in and visit. "
6410088,170953344,2017-07-16,43633823,Paul,"The house was lovely and very well decorated with all amenities. It was walking distance to many places including the Butterfly park and the beach. My daughter-in-law went for runs in the neighborhood with her 18 month old daughter in a stroller. She even ran  to the Monterey aquarium one morning with her daughter. Restaurants in Pacific Grove were very good and child friendly. Very good location for Monterey, Carmel, Pebble Beach and Pacific Grove. For the family members coming from Texas and Tennessee the weather (highs in 60's ) was a welcome respite from the heat. A great place for a family vacation."
6410088,173523686,2017-07-23,16241463,Mira,"Thank you again for opening your beautiful home to us this past weekend Ahnalisa! The house was spacious even for a large group of us. The kitchen was so well stocked with dishes and appliances for being able to cook meals at the house which we really enjoyed. And we loved the back patio space, super relaxing and great for eating breakfast outside in the morning. Great to have access to the grill out there too. It was lovely being able to walk down to the beach while also being close to the downtown area of Pacific Grove. And it is central to many of the beautiful hiking areas in the greater Monterey/Big Sur/Carmel Valley area, so endless opportunities for outdoor enjoyment just a short drive away. Ahnalisa was very communicative, easy to get in touch with for questions, and made us feel very at home. Definitely would recommend this spot to stay in especially with a larger group of folks."
6410088,178133347,2017-08-04,29476777,Dan,"Ahnalisa was very easy to coordinate with and is genuinely interested in making sure you have what you need while you're at the house. The washer was not functioning when we arrived at the house, but Ahnalisa had someone come out to fix the washer, which was great. Check-in and check-out were a breeze, and the area is extremely scenic and beautiful. 

The reason I'm giving three starts instead of four is because of the following: the kitchen was cluttered and difficult to navigate, the fridge had expired food in it (and was really full when we arrived which made it difficult to store our food for the week), the mashing machine was initially broken (though was fixed after a couple of days!), and the cat on the premises had fleas."
6410088,182394526,2017-08-14,117465391,Leisa,"Ahnalisa's home is beautiful and filled with interesting pieces, but still very warm and inviting. It's maybe a 5 minute drive from Cannery Row. We were a group of 7 adults, all fit comfortably, and really enjoyed staying here."
6410088,190741141,2017-09-04,39970413,Owen,"Lovely home on a quiet street. Walkable to shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove and beach/venues in Asilomar. Fascinating art, charming and peaceful garden and front yard,"
6410088,199738178,2017-10-02,76175441,Katherine,This accommodation and location are excellent. Thanks
6410088,221524491,2017-12-26,2080484,Chen,"We had a great time at Ahnalisa's place.  Check-in and communication were quick and easy.  The place was spacious for our group and the kitchen was well stocked for all of our cooking needs.  Great location in Pacific Grove, and within walking distance to the beach (10 min walk).  Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
6410088,223749299,2018-01-01,4481651,Jeimee,Perfect location. We walked to wonderful outdoor places everyday. Lovely comfortable home. We’d definitely stay there again.
6410088,225828113,2018-01-07,1506372,Olivier,My family and I really enjoyed our stay !!
6410088,236208452,2018-02-18,168920792,Michelle,"Wonderful host, Beautiful home, Perfect location! Our group could not have wished for a better setting and Ahnalisa was a delight, easy to get in touch with and made sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend, especially if you're looking for a true taste of the California coastal lifestyle."
6528319,39500496,2015-07-24,216752,Ferrell & Lloyd,"A roomy house with laundry, kitchen and bath made a good accommodation for four adults and four children. Location was great with easy access to restaurants, shopping the beach and the Monterey Aquarium"
6528319,41946304,2015-08-10,5548867,Michael,"Cute little 20's house in the heart of Pacific Grove. Fabulous location to walk and see Lighthouse Ave shops, the many historic cottages toward the bay or head straight to the beach. Has a small deck with chairs/tables outside for lounging or BBQ (propane BBQ out there too) if the weather permits. Everything worked though since it is an older house (closing in on the century mark) some things are not as functional or pristine as a newer house. We liked the character of the place though. Old is good! Next door neighbor is the Red House Cafe... a nice little restaurant. No excessive noise or smell from it. The only noise we heard at all was the USPS trucks unloading at 5am (post office backs up to the house). The room at the back of the house gets the brunt of that noise. If you're a light sleeper… choose another of the rooms and leave that one to the snorers. We'd stay here again. "
6528319,44954070,2015-08-30,3207904,Julie,"We had a wonderful time at Cheryl's place. Exactly as described, had all the amenities needed. Excellent location, could walk to shops and restaurants. And the aquarium is only about a 5 minute drive away. "
6528319,45983559,2015-09-07,3941653,Harry,"The cottage is lovely and the location is fantastic -- one block away from Passionfish, one of the best restaurants around."
6528319,48457590,2015-09-26,21825732,Octavio,"We had an amazing time at Cheryl's little cottage. The house was very welcoming and cozy. Location is superb, just a few blocks from the beach, near lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops, close to a great kids playground... We loved every bit of our time there. We hope to return to Monterey/Pacific Grove and stay here again! The key strengths of this place were: 
- comfy beds with plenty of clean sheets
- clean and cozy towels
- great showers
- well equipped kitchen
- location!!!
- extra sofa bed in one of the rooms which worked out great for our kids
- wifi/TV
- very clean
- house and neighborhood had a classy early 20th century feel (next door house was built in 1908) which we loved"
6528319,53199598,2015-11-06,46951448,Jim,The house was clean and ready for us. We liked the neighbor hood. However the door to the back bathroom was off (just leaned own the wall at the door opening. My husband put it back so the door would close. My husband had a construction company for many years. Lucky for us he carries tools. The kitchen was well supplied and we enjoyed that very much.
6528319,53325200,2015-11-08,9691010,MacKenzie,"I rented this cottage with a group of friends for a destination wedding we all were attending.  Cheryl was a great host, she sent all the info we needed several weeks prior to our arrival.   Very organized, and everything was exactly as stated.  Cute little house, property had an excellent location, walking distance to everything we needed -- shops, attractions, restaurants, etc. -- and also had all the amenities we needed.  Very nice outdoor area too, which would have been great to eat dinner or enjoy the evening with a glass of wine under the stars, but with the wedding we didn't have any time for that.  

One thing to note, it's 3 bed/2ba, but the 2 bathrooms in the house are located inside of the bedrooms.  If you are traveling with 3 couples who don't know each other so well, middle-of-the-night bathroom trips for the one couple that gets a bedroom with no bathroom could be a bit awkward.  We all knew each other very well so it wasn't a problem at all -- just something to keep in mind.

Overall a great place -- would definitely stay here again."
6528319,55955084,2015-12-07,49364511,Collie,Excellent! The min attractions are within walking distance-great quiet and safe neighborhood-children's park a block away-coffee house is 2 blocks away
6528319,68309018,2016-04-04,16287658,Lorien,"I stayed here for three nights with four adults and two kids. This little cottage is in an excellent location.  Just blocks from the beach, a playground, and just adjacent to several shops and restaurants. I second a previous reviewer's recommendation for Passionfish, which is a block away.  The bakery around the corner was lovely for morning pastries.  The drawback to the location is that the post office in the back is super loud at 5am with trucks coming in and moving deliveries around.  The bedrooms were pleasant and the linens nice and comfy.  The kitchen is on the small side and doesn't have a dishwasher, so plan to eat out and mostly have snacks or breakfast in."
6528319,69968802,2016-04-15,23006202,Sharon,"This is a great neighborhood.   The cottage is comfortable with good heat and water service and convenient to excellent restaurants.  The bedroom with the laundry facilities tends to be the noisiest because of the postal trucks arriving at the post office about 5am.   Because the two baths are connected to two bedrooms, the people in the third bedroom would only have access to a bathroom by walking through another bedroom."
6528319,70617816,2016-04-19,56074848,Jack,"Perfect location in Pacific Beach.  About 3 short blocks to the ocean and just steps from the main street of Pacific Beach.  Even though it is close to the main street, it is very quiet.  The 3rd bedroom has no access to either of the two bathrooms, so that is an important consideration in your decision.  The ideal situation for this house would probably be 2 couples."
6528319,71479984,2016-04-25,56628661,Kaitlyn,"Great little house! We had two couples staying so each had their own bathroom. We had plenty of space. We BBQed one night on the patio and enjoyed the short walk to the beach and into Pacific Grove. There is an outstanding little restaurant right next door, and several other local PG places one block away. The location was great for dinning and walking downtown. Overall great time at the little yellow cottage!"
6528319,75723504,2016-05-22,49652745,Linnaea,"I would definitely stay here again!  This was perfect for our family of 6.   Cozy and sweet, absolutely lovely.  Amazing location.   Thank you for hosting!   "
6528319,78067105,2016-06-05,12070618,Yingnan,"We had a great time staying at Cheryl's lovely cottage. It has great location, close to restaurants, shops, beaches, everything. The communication with Cheryl was flawless. She sent me everything I need to know before our trip started. The house is clean and well maintained. Really enjoyed our stay here."
6528319,79256053,2016-06-12,56555553,Chris,"My family and I stayed at the yellow cottage a week ago. I did not write you upon our departure because I needed time to clarify my thoughts on our stay in your cottage. 

Our stay was not as we had expected. When we first arrived there was a note saying there is been a flood. The carpets were hanging outside in the house carpets were Dan. This made things difficult seeing as we had a toddler walking around and dragging her blanket around the house. The house smelled very musky. Due to the flood before our arrival, I feel as though you're cleaning service spent their time mopping the flood in the kitchen instead of cleaning the house. We went around and picked up pieces of wrappers and food up off the carpet before our child had a chance to eat it. When it came time to cook dinner for the children, we found that all of the dishes and pots and pans in the cupboards were filled with water. Needless to say we did not clean out all of your dishes, pots and pans, therefore we could not use your kitchen, one of the important reasons we stayed in a house versus a hotel. 

I feel it is important for your guest to know that you are behind the post office which gets deliveries every morning at four in the morning lasting over an hour. this was not included in your information when we researched places to stay. Your bathroom has rust on the bathtub making it difficult to bathe without getting rest all over your children. Another important piece of information you do not include in your summary. We left a night early due to the uncomfortable setting of your cottage."
6528319,80501042,2016-06-18,29595812,Jason,"Great location right along the downtown strip, and a short walk to the coast. Restaurant next door has great breakfast. The house was well stocked with all the necessities (dishes, silverware, TP, soaps, etc.) and clean. The BBQ and the deck out back was a  nice spot to hang out and grill. And having laundry in the unit was great. 

Downside was the USPS location on the other side of the back fence. Extremely loud banging at 5am, so don't expect to sleep in if you are in that bedroom. The other 2 bedrooms were not as bad for noise. We are generally early risers, so not a huge deal, but was obnoxious. 

Overall a great place to stay in Pacific Grove, worked well for our group of 5. "
6528319,81527646,2016-06-23,912107,Rachel,I had a great stay with my husband and 2 small children at this spot in Pacific Grove. It was a great location- we were able to walk to the Lovers Point beach (about 7 mins) and the house was right next to the main strip with a couple of restaurants. The house is right next to a great cafe that we had breakfast at one morning. The house was clean when we got there and the shower was good. Only 1 of the bedrooms (the middle one) had the heat flowing to it though which made for a cold room for my son at night. Also the rooms were very bright  and it was easy to hear trucks driving by so everyone woke up pretty early every morning. Overall a nicely set up beach house with space for a family of 4 with a great location. 
6528319,89976278,2016-07-30,28023965,Dawn,"Cheryl was very accommodating and sent us instructions a few days before our arrival. The location of this house is excellent! It is right in the town of Pacific Grove with access to many cafes. And a couple short blocks to Lovers Point. Our party included 5 adults and 2 children so the little house was very full and probably would have been much more comfortable with less people. Everything inside is very dated but clean and a great value. These few updates would make this an excellent choice: new blinds in the windows on the front of the house to improve privacy from the street; new, firmer bed pillows. All things considered we would recommend this place as a great value for families wanting to stay in this area."
6528319,91321154,2016-08-04,57650806,Sharon,"The location is absolutely perfect. It is close to all the main highlights (lovers point, cafés, aquarium), and we would have absolutely loved to have given an overall positive review (because we loved being in Pacific Grove), but we feel we should be honest.

We were put off by the fact that the house is not very well maintained and in that way the pics do not reflect reality. The furniture and equipment is old and it is actually quite dirty at places:
- the carpets in the living room and bedroom are really dirty: they smell. 
- the kitchen cupboards where all sticky, they were greasy
- the pots and pans really should be replaced. 

It truly is ashame, cause I think in the basis it is a lovely cottage in a wonderful place, but with a bit of cleaning and maintenance you could make so much more out of it! "
6528319,107378430,2016-10-10,58727648,Jim,"This is an absolutely great location, but unfortunately the house is a disappointment.    It is within walking distance of the best restaurants on the Monterey Peninsula.  The aquarium,  cannery row, the monarch refuge and beautiful beaches and coast views are very close.   The house however needs major cleaning and has maintenance issues.   The last review by Sharon nailed it.  "
6528319,109190888,2016-10-20,11277234,Tom,"We were a bit taken aback when we entered Cheryl's cottage Sunday afternoon as the first thing we saw was stained carpet in the living room / entry area.   Remants of the flood that  is mentioned in earlier reviews?That kind of jaded our opinion of the home.  

In fairness I thought it best to go back and read the description before writing this review.  Everything represented by Cheryl is accurate; rooms, baths, great location, wifi, etc.  Kitchen is nicely furnished.   Cheryl was very responsive to questions upon our arrival.  We walked to dinner two nights and we enjoyed window shopping up and down Lighthouse Ave.  Pacific Grove golf links and an amazing view of the rugged shoreline are a short five minute drive.  Believe the cost represented a very good value for the area.  So from that standpoint all good!!

In my opinion are a couple things should be represented in the home's description.  First, there is a post office directly behind the home that had loud truck unloading activity  at 5 AM that woke all four of us each of the three mornings we were there.  Secondly, there is no onsite parking.  Not a huge deal as we were generally able to find parking for our two cars on our street as we came back from golf late in the afternoons. Lastly each bath is accessed through two of the bedrooms.  Anyone staying in the third bedroom would need to access the bathroom via one of the bedrooms.  None of these are deal breakers but each would be nice to know going in.

6528319,144363608,2017-04-15,118438045,Randal,We loved staying at the little yellow cottage! It's right by downtown Pacific Grove and has great parking options nearby. The apartment was very clean and the beds super comfy. The garden isn't in the best shape but that didn't really bother us. Thanks for having us! We had a great time!!

We were able to pick up our key to the house and Debra was
attentive to our needs and any issues we had."

The only downside was that while the house (kitchen, bedrooms) were nice overall, the living room was much darker and less spacious than it appeared in the photo."
6574233,53972430,2015-11-15,44088330,Tanya,"This is our first experience using Airbnb.
We were very happy that everything described was just as represented!
We got in after hours & getting the information etc. for the house upon arrival was very easy. 
The house was great, very comfortable, we enjoyed our stay there.
The neighborhood was nice, we didn't experience any problems, had nice walk in the neighborhood.

6574233,58678642,2016-01-03,23757812,Samir,"The house is very nice for a family get together. The kitchen is a bit dated, but very well stocked. It's got all kinds of herbs and utensils including a wine fridge.
It also has a nice backyard, although we couldn't use it as it was cold during the New Year's season.

I would recommend this place for a family reunion. It is walking distance to Spanish Bay, and pretty close to everything required - groceries, sightseeing, dining etc.

Please request the house to be pre-heated as the ceilings are high and it takes a while to warm up. "
6574233,61066976,2016-01-31,37178070,Dan,"Our foursome of guys stayed here at the end of January, and it was fantastic. The house is as comfortable as it looks - plenty of room, comfortable beds, nice outside area. Debra & Co. were also great. There was a minor issue with a new thermostat in the house, and she had someone out to fix it right away. Very responsive and accommodating. Thanks Debra.

6574233,69199230,2016-04-10,25507012,Conor,"The house was perfect for our vacation with 4 adults and 4 kids. The living area is really spacious, and the dining table and area are very well sized and separate but connected in a very nice open floor plan. The house had all the equipment you would need for cooking and living - and was very tastefully decorated with many nice touches for us. All exceptionally clean. We enjoyed loads of activities from the house including biking, running and surfing. Spanish Bay is just down the road! We would definitely come back."
6574233,72023662,2016-04-30,27171427,Carla,"The home was lovely.  A nice touch to leave travel size soap, shampoo, etc.  The neighborhood was quiet and down the street was a nice walking path."

6646306,35025504,2015-06-14,35082363,Robert,"Seth was an amazing host and the room that he and Wendy provided was perfect. He was warm and welcoming, and was very receptive to questions about the area. He was also flexible with our check-in time.

The room was exactly as depicted in the posting. It was clean and comfortable, and included great amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, fresh toiletries, and even snacks. The location is perfect for visitors: a 5 minute drive from downtown Monterey and a 10 minute drive from downtown Carmel. Seth gave us a discounted cab ride into Carmel one day, as offered in his posting.

We had an awesome stay in Monterey, due in part to staying with Seth and Wendy. Highly recommended!"
6646306,35599800,2015-06-20,35371735,Caity,"What an excellent time we had! Seth greeted us when we arrived and walked us through the details of the space. Super cute, clean, and convenient location. The bed was very comfortable! Next time I'm in Monterey I will definitely be staying here again! "
6646306,35734117,2015-06-21,14765672,Kitty,"The house is located about 10 minutes from the aquarium/fisherman's wharf. When booking, I had no qualms communicating with the host. The room is spacious, and the only problem was that there wasn't enough lighting at night. It would be great if there were more lamps in the room. All in all, it was a great place to stay for a short getaway."
6646306,36210473,2015-06-26,34942595,Casey,"Seth was there to meet us when we arrived, he promptly gave us a tour of the place. When we needed something he was always gracious and quick to respond. We felt very relaxed at Seth and Wendy's place. It was the perfect home base for adventures in Monterey and Santa Cruz.  The bed was comfortable, I can't think of anything negative. We will definitely visit again if we travel this way again. 
Thank you Seth + Wendy for making us feel at home"
6646306,36449344,2015-06-28,24564054,Owen,"The room was exactly as described. We arrived just after 7pm, and our hosts showed us right to the room. Seems newly refinished, in great condition. Exactly as described. We didn't hear from our hosts the rest of the weekend, which is exactly what we wanted. We knew that they were literally down the hall if we needed them though."
6646306,36746455,2015-06-30,14325055,Heather,"Seth welcomed us in person and set us up in his super-comfy, very private guest room with a neat, clean en suite bathroom. The place is in a quiet, tree-dotted neighborhood less than a five minute drive from the Aquarium and Fisherman's Wharf. Also, Seth is available for discounted taxi rides if you need one, and offered to take us to his wife's studio for massages! We'd stay here again for sure. "

The room was spotless, cozy, quiet and exactly what I needed to settle in for the first couple days of a work contract. Seth was incredibly responsive, kind and available to answer any questions or requests. They provide their guests with a lot of privacy and comfort (the bed and bedding is great) and even nice shampoo! Thank you, Seth and Wendy!"

We arrived quite late the first night and Seth was very kind to wait for us and to show us around .
As we had an independent entrance it really felt we had our own little studio in Monterey. 
Overall a very nice experience ."

The space itself was peaceful and quiet, just as described. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Also, being kind of a germophobe, I was happy to find everything to be very clean. We liked that the room had its own entrance and a mini fridge. The hosts are also very respective of your privacy. "

We found communication with them very quick and easy to arrange our arrival.  There is WIFI which is great and the room was very clean and comfortable!

We like cross breeze and there are windows on two sides of the room that allowed for this!  There was some construction going on at the other side of the house during the day, but this generally did not bother us as we were either walking on the beach or using the aquarium passes that come with the room!

The only complaint I have is the fact that we arrived a few minutes after the 3pm check in time, and there was no one there to check us in, so we had to wait about 10min for someone to arrive. Otherwise, it was  a really pleasant place to stay!"

The space was exactly as pictured!! Even better in my opinion. Bedroom and bathroom were very clean and spacious! Bed was very comfortable!

Although we did not meet Seth, Wendy was very welcoming and was helpful with any questions. The room was very nice and a spacious and was perfect for the night! I would recommend staying here and the aquarium was a site to see! "
6646306,59189610,2016-01-07,6068042,Julia,We enjoyed the privacy we had and the bed was comfortable. The place was great. Would definitely return next time in Monterey. Enjoyed the muffins!
6646306,59315976,2016-01-09,4872989,Jae,"Angelica (Wendy's daughter) greeted us upon arrival with open arms. Any questions I had, Wendy was able to answer them proficiently and with a smile. The location was walking distance or a short drive to all of the attractions, so that was a big plus. The room/ bed was comfortable and if I'm ever in the Monterey area, I would stay here again. "
6646306,59558616,2016-01-11,7231389,Christopher,Seth and Wendy were excellent hosts :) They made us feel at home and with the aquarium passes it's such a good deal! Thanks for everything!
6646306,59683708,2016-01-13,5900757,Rob,Seth was a superb host; flexible and very accommodating. The room itself was spacious yet cosy with all the amenities you expect - the fridge was a nice bonus!
6646306,59941984,2016-01-17,22502550,Peter,"It was great!  Nice, cozy place."
6646306,60078854,2016-01-18,5984047,Mary,"We loved staying at Wendy and Seth's place. Angie, Wendy's daughter, was very accomodating and let us check in early and pick up the aquarium tickets, which we really appreciated. The room itself was quiet and peaceful and the bed very comfortable. We would definitely stay with them again!"
6646306,60337766,2016-01-22,4941847,Matt & Sara,"The room was a great value and conveniently located to all of the Monterey and Pacific Grove attractions.  As an added bonus, the bed was super comfortable!  We didn't meet Wendy but Seth was very nice and available.  His suggestion for late-night sushi was a life-saver.  A definite recommend."
6646306,60555459,2016-01-24,55749386,San,"Although our interaction with seth and wendy were limited, they were very accommodating! We had all of the amenities needed and the room was nice and clean!
Will stay again!"
6646306,61099541,2016-01-31,17725657,Rodrigo,Property as described and Seth and Wendy were incredibly accommodating. They were easy to contact and went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. We definitely plan on staying again for our next visit!!
6646306,61607518,2016-02-06,12059411,Kristen,"What an amazing weekend! Originally we were slated to stay one night, but with the accommodation of Seth, Wendy and Angela (daughter), and the undeniable feeling of being a guest in a happy home, we were able to extend our stay another night. This weekend is exactly why we use Airbnb! "
6646306,61720780,2016-02-07,14235470,Alyssa,"The room and bathroom were very nice. The location was in a quiet neighborhood so we mostly drove 5 min down to the more touristy places. It's situations nicely to drive down to Carmel or Big Sur. The aquarium passes were also well worth their value!

Also, the hosts were very accommodating and quick to respond to texts. The morning before we were supposed to check in, they let us drop off our bags so that we could go for a hike."
6646306,62121563,2016-02-11,33861745,Annette,"Had such a great stay! We were only 5 minutes from cannery row and the added bonus for us, was the free passes to the aquarium. Seth was so nice, and their home was beautiful! They had the most comfortable bed/pillows in the world. Probably one of my best nights sleep in a while! Thanks so much guys! Next time we're back, we definitely will book again!  "
6646306,62263018,2016-02-13,13889792,Cheyenne,Amazing location and amazing room! We had a late flight and Seth graciously met us even though we didn't arrive until midnight. It was so comfortable and extremely private. I would definitely stay here again! 
6646306,62508052,2016-02-15,52090758,Katrina,"My boyfriend and I loved our stay! We arrived an hour earlier than the check-in time and Seth was able to let us in. It was our first Airbnb stay and we didn't know what to expect but the room was surprisingly cozy and very private! Cannery Row is down the street. The aquarium passes were also a great plus! We didn't have to stand in the long line to get it since members have their own entrance. Overall, our stay was amazing!

Definitely would stay again!!"
6646306,62734764,2016-02-16,53827443,军,Great place
6646306,62921456,2016-02-18,6886966,David,We had a great time during our two night stay. The place was clean and quiet with a short ride to the Aquarium (thanks for the two free passes!). Would definitely recommend staying there. 
6646306,63069755,2016-02-20,49273032,Jaimin,Hosts were super helpful and nice. Bedroom and bathroom were clean and nicely furnished. Area was in a quiet neighborhood. Room also came with free Monterey aquarium tickets!!
6646306,63338393,2016-02-22,6573026,Dawson,"Seth was home when we arrived to give us a quick tour of the space, the space is exactly as described. The Monterey Bay Aquarium tickets make this a great deal for such a spacious and clean room. Everything we needed was provided, the linens were very nice and comfortable, and having a mini-fridge in our room made it so we could store leftovers and other snacks. The location is a bit away from downtown Monterey, but a quick 5-minute drive from everything. My girlfriend and I had a great weekend stay with Seth and Wendy and would definitely recommend the space to others."
6646306,64348373,2016-03-02,11861085,Sam,"Great, big room in lovely house, good shower and had a great, quiet night's sleep! "
6646306,64381307,2016-03-03,14398734,Shannon,"Seth was a great host! We met Seth quite briefly upon our arrival and immediately went over to the Monterey Bay Aquarium until closing time with the passes included in the reservation. At $40/person for an adult ticket, the included passes in this reservation were a steal and the aquarium itself was a real treat. The home is walkable to the main strip – about a mile, but there are hills! – and the private room & bathroom were lovely. The bed was beyond comfortable – I did not want to get up in the morning! All in all we had quick and lovely 1-night stay and I would gladly stay here again. "
6646306,64842712,2016-03-08,4767502,Catherine,"Seth made us feel completely comfortable and was very accommodating. The bed was incredibly comfortable, we could barely get out of it while it was pouring down rain outside. We were traveling with our 4 year old son and the room was definitely big enough for us to blow up his air mattress. The parking was very easy. We did have to drive to town in order to do most of our activities, but that was not a problem. Would certainly stay there again. The Monterey Bay Aquarium passes were an awesome bonus. "
6646306,65362855,2016-03-13,6794992,Chelsie,Seth was a great host.  House was in a great area.  The aquarium passes were a awesome plus.  Totally will stay here again.
6646306,66015691,2016-03-18,31184948,Leon,Seth is a great host. We arranged arrival earlier than posted time and Seth was very accommodating. The Aquarium was within walking distance and the free passes are great.   
6646306,66054889,2016-03-19,44913809,Amber,This was a wonderful convenient location and the room could not have been more comfortable or clean. The Aquarium passes were such a plus. We were blown away by that place! Thank you Seth and Wendy for a fabulous stay in Monterey!
6646306,66804298,2016-03-24,35155973,Margaret,"Great location near 17 mile drive, aquarium and Fisherman's Wharf. Parking spot right next to room. Bed very comfortable. Refrigerator in room. No place to hang clothing. No TV in room. Heat works very well. Aquarium passes a real plus. "
6646306,66893224,2016-03-25,45232162,Izzy,"Thank you Seth, Wendy and Angela for a lovely stay! Your room is perfect and with the aquarium passes it is great value for money. Will definitely consider staying here next time we are in the area again! "
6646306,67018253,2016-03-26,48095408,Jenny,"Seth was an excellent host while we had our stay. He was friendly and hospitable, and the room we stayed in was beautiful. It felt very private and secluded. The aquarium passes were also great! He was also very communicative and helpful as we were making plans. Would definitely recommend! "
6646306,67319653,2016-03-28,6146255,Ted,"Everything as described. The room is spacious, and the bed is queen size/comfortable. Common areas are neat and large. Aquarium passes could be used beyond check-out time (we returned them by the next party's check-in). Wi-fi was easy to connect to. The fridge in the room spacious enough, i.e. not large but not a dorm-size either.

Was in contact with hosts by phone to give them heads-up on our arrival time. No problem to find with GPS. 

Recommend for a not too fancy stay if you are to explore the area."
6646306,68092974,2016-04-02,4074484,Lowell,"A very good location tended by warm hosts who went out of their way to make our short stay a very pleasant one. The Monterey Bay Aquarium passes were a welcome bonus! The room was clean, spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. Made us wish we had stayed longer!"
6646306,68096679,2016-04-02,9990773,Mary,"A nice welcome, lovely room and comfy bed enhanced by the Acquarium visit. "
6646306,68558136,2016-04-05,143459,Emily,"This space is in a great location close to the aquarium and restaurants/bars.  The passes are a wonderful bonus that makes this a really great value.  The room is spacious and clean, and the common room has amenities such as fresh water, coffee, a fridge, and microwave.  All in all, a pleasant stay in a beautiful city!"
6646306,68820796,2016-04-06,22489921,Sydnee,"I didn't actually have a chance to meet Seth or Wendy, but the stay was wonderful. The aquarium passes were a huge plus as well! Room was comfortable and clean."
6646306,68884011,2016-04-07,5196341,Chris,Seth greeted us at the door and kindly explained the set up. It was great to have our own large room and bathroom and entrance. It was a very easy-going stay.
6646306,69233045,2016-04-10,15536227,Erin,"Seth & Wendy's place is so quiet and peaceful. The bed is a dream; my husband and I slept like angels. It's clean and comfortable and it couldn't be easier to find - a straight shot up the hill from all the major retail streets, the aquarium and Cannery Row. They couldn't be there to meet us but asked a darling friend to greet us and show us the amenities. No closet but there is a double hook on the back of the bathroom door. We would stay with them again. "
6646306,69431104,2016-04-11,8088012,Stephanie,We had a great stay here. Communication ahead of the visit was very clear and responsive. The room had everything we needed for our 1-night stay and the aquarium passes worked out great for us. Would recommend to anyone looking for a comfy place not far from the aquarium.
6646306,69679556,2016-04-12,66487555,Deepak S,Sweet little place. Heater was awesome for the cold weather. Lisa was very helpful with our queries and the aquarium passes were a bonus! Very close to the cannery row area.
6646306,70695157,2016-04-19,53603565,Katherine,"This is a great place, I would definitely recommend staying here. The room is very private and comfortable. The location is convenient, very close to downtown Monterey. Seth and Wendy were gracious hosts. We loved having access to their aquarium passes. I have only good things to say about this listing! "
6646306,71073825,2016-04-23,4508044,Ann,"This was a lovely room and bathroom and a great location.  It was easy to find and easy to park.  Wendy's daughter met us when we arrived and showed us around, suggesting places to eat and shop.  The extra benefit is two free Monterey Aquarium passes which almost pay for the room themselves.  The family has another AirBnB room and a separate and comfy living room to sit in the evening, and to chat, if you want, with the other guests.  Seth sat with us and talked about the area several nights and his daughter brought us a plate of fruit to enjoy."
6646306,71209993,2016-04-24,5506573,Sameer,"Seth and Wendy were very welcoming. We stayed at the Peaceful Space unit and this had a side entrance from the house, making it very private and convenient to access. The room is very cozy and nicely decorated. 

Highly recommend this place. "
6646306,71415041,2016-04-25,46711519,Dennis,"Our stay at Seth's place was great. Hospitable host with passes to the aquarium, hars to beat. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks Seth."
6646306,71940645,2016-04-30,14288016,Laura,"My husband and I felt very welcomed at Seth and Wendy's home. So much care and attention to detail have clearly been paid to make the room, the shared spaces, and the whole stay a cozy and enjoyable experience. We were so grateful for Seth and Wendy's generosity in providing passes to the aquarium and their accommodating our schedule with this excursion."
6646306,72255328,2016-05-01,1107401,Myla,"Seth and Wendy's space was peaceful, quiet, and spacious just as described. Communication with Seth was very easy, and once we arrived, he showed us around briefly which was all we needed. I liked that we had a private entrance and bathroom. It was very easy to get around to Monterey and Pacific Grove from here. What a great spot for my first AirBnB stay. Would definitely return. Thanks Seth and Wendy! It was delightful."
6646306,72604595,2016-05-03,20766095,Joshua,The place was very clean and tidy. The listing was accurate and the host was very warm and welcoming. We were not left wanting for anything. The aquarium passes were very much appreciated. We had a great time there. Would definitely stay here again.
6646306,72840574,2016-05-04,67563336,Oliver,"Very nice, clean room. Seth seemed very nice. The tickets for the aquarium worked great, and Seth seemed happy enough for me to swing by and pick them up a few hours before check-in time. A pleasant stay :)"
6646306,73311816,2016-05-08,5183231,Nathan,"We enjoyed our stay - the room is nice and large, very clean, and the listing is accurate. It was a great basecamp for us to explore the area. We stayed with our 5 year old in the room and there was plenty of space for all of us. We didn't use the common living room area other than to heat up a few things in the microwave, but it was a nice additional space. Thanks so much for the room!"
6646306,73819828,2016-05-10,33613400,笑蝶,"非常好的房间。还有暖气,单独卫生间。虽然离海边有点远。不过有车也挺方便。房东会讲中文,送了我们两张海洋馆的门票!非常好看!蒙特雷应该多住几天的。下次还要来。"
6646306,73959077,2016-05-11,25248730,Jordana,Our experience at seth's and Wendy's place was very positive. Everything was as described and besides the room itself there is a very big common area that one can use. The aquarium tickets are a huge plus and it all worked out great! We only got to meet their daughter Angela but she was very helpful and welcoming. We had a good stay in this cute little room in Monterey. Thank you! 
6646306,74242381,2016-05-14,43603547,John,"We really enjoyed our stay in this peaceful space. The bedroom with its adjoining bathroom was spacious, cosy,  clean and comfortable and felt very private as it had its own entrance. The shared sitting room space was well equipped with everything you need to make drinks and for simple self-catering. We enjoyed chatting with the Finnish visitors in the Airbnb room next door to ours in this shared sitting space. We  didn't meet Seth or Wendy but we were warmly greeted by Wendy's daughter, Angela, who was delightful and gave us every help we needed. She even brought us all chopped water melon when she came in one evening. Thank you Angela! The tickets to the aquarium were so enormously appreciated as this is an amazing visit not to be missed - we went in three times in two days. Although a good walk downhill to Cannery Row, this Airbnb has multiple good restaurants and shops nearby with a less than 10 minute stroll. We would definitely recommend this Airbnb."
6646306,74996103,2016-05-18,1613961,Jacob,"Spacious and nice place. The bed was great with a very good mattress. We didn't meet Seth and Wendy, but Wendy's daughter, Angela, was really sweet, helpful and communicative. The aquarium pass worked perfectly. Downtown is in walking distance, although the way back uphill can seem a little long.

Highly recommended."
6646306,75396841,2016-05-21,50942220,Haoyang,very nice house
6646306,75538494,2016-05-22,27713493,Elesha,"Seth and Wendy's daughter was warm, welcoming and accommodating to our late check in.  The room was clean and the space provided privacy since it had a separate entrance. The bed was so cozy and comfy! A perfect birthday weekend, just wish we could have stayed longer. Next time we visit Monterey we will stay here again! "
6646306,75905869,2016-05-23,33306046,Sophy,"The room was lovely, very spacious and clean with an ensuite and a convenient separate entrance. The location is good if you're driving, not great for walking. Angela was very welcoming and the aquarium passes are a real bonus. There are 2 other airbnb rooms at this location so at times it felt quite busy. "
6646306,76272167,2016-05-26,9356942,Cyndy,"This airbnb experience was one of my favorites.  Great, peaceful, welcoming room with private bath.  Common area was so nice, and most importantly, Angela was so helpful and accommodating.  I took Angela's suggestions regarding the aquarium, parking, scenic drives, and restaurants, and this made the trip super enjoyable.  Will definitely return!"
6646306,76555888,2016-05-28,30670212,Nikki,"We loved our stay at Seth and Wendy's place! We didn't get to meet them, but their daughter Angela helped us with our check in and showed us around the space. She was very responsive through text and even though we got there kinda late she was still very accommodating. Everything was very clean and the bed was so comfortable! The aquarium passes were also a great addition! We were able to use them the next day! We will definitely be staying again if we're ever in the area! "
6646306,76626562,2016-05-28,3135750,Pauline,"Angela gave us quick tour of the place upon arrival, and pointed out some great tips for our stay -- 24-hour Safeway within walking distance, and where to find free parking close to the aquarium. The place was clean, quaint, and just what we needed for a one-night stay in beautiful Monterey. She made sure we knew how to reach her if needed, but left us to our own devices the entire time. The space has a private entrance and felt very safe. Overall, great experience!"
6646306,77151655,2016-05-30,31089502,Rocio,Awesome place!
6646306,77612680,2016-06-02,14482192,Rob,"Amazing place!
My wife and I booked the day before and the room was ready for us by late morning.
Room we received has its own private entrance and bathroom making it feel like a boutique hotel. 
Plus we got two aquarium passes included with the room!
Lastly, our host was top notch. She checked us in and then gave us a recommended itinerary to maximize our short stay in the city. 
I highly recommend this place.  "
6646306,77942372,2016-06-04,56623020,Julee,We enjoyed the private room and bath.

6646306,149735024,2017-05-05,28519672,John,"Very nice place, plenty of room, quiet street, and easy access to shopping and the coast."
6646306,165419287,2017-07-01,109523249,Tatiana,"I stayed in Seth and Wendy's larger private room for 2 months while working at an internship in the area. This spot was the perfect location and price, close to the grocery store, cannery row, and downtown Monterey, but still quiet in a nice neighborhood. There was a large tv in the room which wasn't featured in the pictures which was an added bonus. Not cable, but I was able to login with my Netflix account. My favorite features were the private entrance, private bathroom, and mini fridge. Seth was very easy to communicate with via text for picking up packages, borrowing items, etc. They open up the rest of their home for use of the kitchen, lounge area, and laundry if you wish. Overall I had a great stay and I definitely would not hesitate to recommend any of Seth and Wendy's rooms. "
6646306,189127401,2017-08-31,52796110,William,"I had a wonderful stay and I would absolutely recommend it to long (or short) term visitors! I did not interact with Wendy, but Seth was welcoming and very easy to get in touch with. The room was spacious and clean and the private entrance was extremely convenient. The house is located in a prime location to access Monterey, Pacific Grove, and Route 1 (if you are traveling farther afield)."
6646306,201107360,2017-10-07,147386830,Fred,clean and comfortable close to everything in Monterey and Pacific Grove
6646306,204156239,2017-10-16,106540161,Cody,"This is a cool little place close to Cannery row with everything you need and some nice personal touches. The bed was super comfy. The heater was great for those chilly Monterey nights. I would recommend it. The physical location provided by Airbnb is not correct, so confirm the proper address with the hosts before you travel to make sure you know where you are staying."
6646306,211340670,2017-11-12,970845,John,I had the fortunate opportunity to travel to Monterey for a weekend work function.  Seth and Wendy’s place perfectly suited my needs.  Their communication and instructions were friendly and welcoming.  Little did I realize how close they were to Monterey’s spectacular sights and tastes.  I hope that I am able to return for business and for pleasure.
6646306,214381627,2017-11-25,48773340,Shayna,"Seth and Wendy have ideal location for visiting Monterey and surrounding areas..

The bed and bath were clean .. The bed was super comfortable and there's coffee and microwave available ..

I would stay there again ~"
6646306,231759936,2018-02-02,80315903,Kevin,"This is a great AirBnB for staying in Monterey! The aquarium passes are a great value, and we very much enjoyed going there. The place is within walking distance to everything in Monterey, but be warned that walking will involve a pretty steep hill.

The space itself was great- the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and getting in and out was very easy. Parking was easy and on-site. We used the heater for a night, and it worked very well. Overall, a great experience and I'd highly recommend Seth and Wendy's place!"
6646306,232425794,2018-02-04,38376685,Martin,"Great place, clean, very close to Trader's Joe and a great vegetarian restaurant cal Julia's. The hosts are great people!"
6646306,233038225,2018-02-07,38376685,Martin,It was better than I expected! The room has it own entrance from the street so it  is like a separate house.
6646306,236259012,2018-02-18,35346056,Fatima,Seth and Wendy were a great host! They wrote detailed instructions so we would not have any issues checking in. We texted them and they responded very quickly. It was a nice quiet place and the aquarium passes were a definitely plus! They were very flexible and overall great.
6646306,237137294,2018-02-21,141068599,Laurie,"Very roomy, great location, beautiful quiet neighborhood,lots of trees, very walkable and shops restaurants nearby. Very comfortable bed, lots of hot water in shower. Seth was very responsive- Love it!!"
6646306,238487070,2018-02-25,73770745,Kyle,This is a nice clean location. The pictures do not do justice to the warm feel to the room. The room is also a good size. The bathroom is clean. We enjoyed our stay and the aquarium passes we're a definite plus.
6646306,241875277,2018-03-10,12375010,Kelly,"Interaction with hosts was minimal but pleasant.  Stayed here to avoid hotels on noisy streets and for comfortable bed.  Mostly got both.  While there is a small refrigerator be aware that it runs cold - I bought veggies at Trader Joe’s and they ended up getting frozen.  :(
No way to make coffee/tea so also keep that in mind.  But space was private, quiet and comfortable bed.  Water heater kicking on was only interruption to my sleep.  Grateful to have found this space for my short trip to Monterey."
6646306,242706550,2018-03-12,98453761,Reed,Great location and great little space.
6646306,243144446,2018-03-14,1817104,Barbara,"We had a nice stay in Monterey. The location is very good, and the room welcoming."
6646306,245098789,2018-03-20,69707618,Sara,This place is great! Cozy and warm and very close to the aquarium. Nice quiet neighborhood but a quick drive to anything you need. The host is very responsive and was able to provide help when needed.
6646306,248572343,2018-03-31,152062530,Hattie,Comfortable bed & plenty of privacy. Close enough to walk to most places we wanted to visit. Loved this cozy space!
6646306,250081189,2018-04-03,177706834,Sonya,What a great location within walking distance to the Aquarium!  Clean and comfortable.  Hosts respect your privacy but quickly respond to your requests.
6646306,250973782,2018-04-06,136909118,Andi,"This place is so rad! It has everything you can ask for in a room! It is very private, spacious and clean. Also, it is very much strategically located in that all forms of convenience are just close by. It is only a short drive from the 17 mile scenic route, Pacific Grove and Carmel and so “ubering” around if you don’t fancy driving too much and having to worry about finding a parking spot is inexpensive. 
More about the room- it has a very warm and homey vibe that will make you feel very cozy. The bed is super comfortable! And the bathroom is huge. Important numbers are also posted on the wall, which is handy. Seth and Wendy really know how to host! They are accommodating and easy to reach in case you need anything. Seth is very helpful and responds right away to texts and inquiries. I loved my stay here! Highly recommended :)"
6688144,35852788,2015-06-22,620732,Deirdre,"Perfectly located in Pacific Grove, this house is great for a family get together. Big open floor plan with living, dining and kitchen all together, it lends itself to dinners, an evening of games and movies. Spend days at the Monterey Aquarium, walking the beaches and shorelines, the famous 17 mile drive, Pebble Beach,  Pt. Logos State Park (so beautiful!) and come home to a relaxing place. 
Danielle was super warm, easy and helpful. She even left balloons to celebrate our Dad's birthday!  
We didn't use the hot tub, but there is one for those chilly evenings or mornings. Nice!"
6688144,36578104,2015-06-29,35243086,Winnie,"Danielle's house has a beautiful kitchen and that's where my family gathered around pretty much the whole weekend. All 3 bedrooms were good sized and clean. The house was literally 5 minutes drive to the beautiful Asilomar Beach. Danielle was very attentive, she responded quickly with any questions I had. I would rent this house again, no doubt!  "
6688144,39029266,2015-07-20,35238958,Myra,"The five of us stayed over at Danielle's home for two nights and loved the experience.  Danielle was a wonderful host.  She communicated several times before we arrived to make sure that we would have everything we needed.  She was so kind to refer us to some fantastic restaurants there in Pacific Grove.  The home is right in the middle of Carmel, Pacific Grove and Monterrey.  Asilomar Beach is right down the road.  We watched the sunsets both nights from there.  We would definitely stay there again should we visit the Monterrey Peninsula area overnight again."
6688144,40240151,2015-07-29,21706727,Katie,Danielle was very welcoming and attentive to our needs. She made sure even our youngest guests were taken care of. Her home is clean and stocked beyond your average rental home. The location cannot be beat! Only a few minutes drive or a longer walk down to Asilomar Beach and away from the crowds of Cannery Row. We enjoyed a lovely farmer's market on Monday just minutes away - not to be missed!  Thank you for giving us a peaceful space to call home!
6688144,40938337,2015-08-03,36536322,Sue,Danielle kept in touch and made me feel comfortable even before arriving. The home was even more beautiful than the photos. Very lovely quiet neighborhood. I would recommend to friends and family.
6688144,42007555,2015-08-10,6323027,Shaun,It was great. Clean and welcoming and a nice bottle of wine and some snacks. 
6688144,43050978,2015-08-17,3661028,David,"The house was charming, well located and very comfortable. It suited the 6 of us very well and was perfect for Monterey Car Week! Everything worked, there was ample room in the living room, great kitchen and there was heaps of parking too. 

The booking process and arrangements to get into the home were done with ease! Danielle was truly friendly and accommodating. "
6688144,45377139,2015-09-02,36437055,Victor,"Lovely house with all the conveniences and nicely equipped kitchen. Jacuzzi and cozy backyard are the nice additions. Very friendly and ready to help owners who know the area and ready to answer the sightseeing questions. Great overall location; just around the corner from 17 miles drive and Trader's Joe/Safeway combination. The town's beach is about 15down/25up minutes away but my recommendation would be to get bikes for at least a couple of days and explore 17 miles drive and connecting towns bike paths. We biked and walked everywhere but we are from NY so walking is a given. For those who love morning runs I would recommend run down to the beach, run along the cliffs, splash in the water by the ""adventures rentals"" and run/walk back to the house. Love to come back one of these days. "
6688144,46882050,2015-09-14,4414047,Ben,"Danielle's home is an absolutely wonderful place to stay.  I stayed here with 4 other friends as we wanted to explore the Monterey and Carmel area for the weekend.

We immediately felt at home staying here.  Danielle provided us with detailed instructions on how to use everything we needed to, as well as a list of great things to check out locally in Pacific Grove - the Red House Cafe was delicious!

The home itself was delightful.  Every bed was extremely comfortable, the hot tub was relaxing, and the kitchen table was large enough for us to all eat around and play board games.

I would definitely stay here again if I was coming back to Pacific Grove.  "
6688144,49624554,2015-10-05,22208799,Katie,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay.  Danielle and Gabriel made us feel so welcome.  The house is in an perfect location, on a nice quiet street, but a quick walk (or run!) to the beach.  It was a perfect place to spend the weekend."
6688144,49892630,2015-10-07,41203236,Yin,"The cabin environment elegant, comfortable facilities complete, the landlord's service is very thoughtful, we spent a happy two days here. In the room there are a lot of beautiful paintings and photography, watching out the landlord is very know how to enjoy life. Last check out when we go to the store to return late, than good time 15 minutes late check-out, inconvenience to the landlord was deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused. Americans have a good environmental protection consciousness, visitors should pay attention to save water. Thank you again for the owner's thoughtful service! "
6688144,50458938,2015-10-12,41824021,David,"This was my first Airbnb experience. Wow, was it a great one. The host answered all of my questions before check-in, made my family and me feel welcomed and the property matched the pics and description (very pleased). If you plan to visit the Pacific Grove, Carmel, Monterey area, I highly recommend this property."
6688144,51269063,2015-10-19,37248058,James,"We stayed in Danielle and Gabriel's house to attend a conference at Asilomar. It was perfect! Three were three of us staying at the house, and each of us walked in and said: ""Wow!"". The welcome board was a nice touch. The house is close enough to walk to Asilomar (although we were lazy and drove). Danielle is highly communicative before and during our stay. We felt very at ease staying there because of her attention to detail and hospitable personality. "
6688144,52090113,2015-10-26,9198852,Andrew,"Danielle and Gabriel's home was very welcoming, check in was very easy and during our stay they were very attentive to our groups needs especially concerning the Jacuzzi. Their home was beautiful and very well kept. Would absolutely stay again."
6688144,52819527,2015-11-02,7744337,Jac,My family stayed here for the weekend of my wedding. They felt at home right away and really enjoyed their stay. Thank you so much for welcoming my family into your beautiful home for our big weekend!
6688144,53452065,2015-11-09,30219273,Joseph,Danielle had excellent communication and provided a very welcoming home for our stay. We were provided with amenities well beyond our expectations and would definitely recommend the house as a place to stay. Conveniently located and a great home. We had a great time during our stay!
6688144,54145600,2015-11-16,35008078,Kristen,"Danielle was amazing! Myself and 4 other girls stayed in her beautiful home for our bachelorette weekend, and had an amazing time! 

We were greeted by balloons (of which were our wedding colors), snacks and a bottle of wine - much appreciated! Danielle also provided great tips on places to see and eat at. 

The house was perfect for our group - beautiful kitchen, great backyard - and hot tub! It is located very close to Monterey - perfect location! "
6688144,55388929,2015-12-01,9711572,Donna,"Every year on Thanksgiving we went to the Monterey area, my son, daughter-in-law, two granddaughters and myself. We’ve experienced many homes and host families, but Danielle and Gabriel by far are the very best!! From the very beginning Danielle was easy to communicate with and made sure everything was set perfectly for our stay. She even called todouble checked as we arrived to be sure everything was just right! No one does that. Wine and snacks on arrival, and a very welcoming message from them. Their home is a touch of France, and a very large dose of love and personality of the owners. We enjoyed every minute there, eating in their lovely remodeled kitchen, walking or running on Asilomar beach a few blocks away, resting in the hot tub, or snuggled up in front of the cozy fireplace. Should you be going to the Monterey area you will have the most wonderful time at Danielle and Gabriel’s home. My very best to you. DCL"
6688144,55932397,2015-12-07,242696,Helena,"Danielle and Gabriel's home is impeccably clean, beautiful, and had several surprising (and tasty) treats ready for us upon arrival! The open floor plan with bonus fireplace was perfect for our small reunion of friends. We ended up loving the coziness of the home so much we never made it outside to the jacuzzi!

Location of this home is fantastic. Anything you need is within a few minutes drive -- even a beautiful beach with expansive coastal views!"
6688144,58525553,2016-01-03,6138097,Joy,"We stayed at Danielle and Gabriel's house for New Years Eve this year with my family. The house was in a nice location, easy walk to Asilomar Beach. The house was comfortable, clean, and accommodated the seven of us quite well. 

We did use the hot tub, which was extremely nice! Surprisingly though we received a private message about closing the door not long after we came inside as if the host was watching us. This was a bit unsettling since I have never had that happen before. Not sure if they were staying at a house within the perimeter of the back-yard. 

Either way, Danielle was great to communicate with and accommodating to all of our needs. "
6688144,58888273,2016-01-05,15836767,Olivia,We had a lovely time at Danielle and Gabriel's and Danielle was very responsive if I had any questions. We loved the hot tub and the grill! The neighborhood was very quiet and the beach was beautiful! Everything was very comfortable and clean in the house! 
6688144,59492640,2016-01-11,626905,Henry,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Danielle and Gabriel's place.  The location is terrific, with Asilomar beach, grocery stores like Trader Joe's and Safeway, and the many shops and cafes on Lighthouse ave all within a 10-15 minute walk away.  We made extensive use of their beautiful and well-supplied kitchen, and we enjoyed the welcome wine and snacks that Danielle had graciously left for us.  We didn't spend much time outside on the deck or in the jacuzzi room, but mostly because it was so cozy and comfortable inside.  The house gets plenty of natural light thanks to many many skylights.  It was just the right size for our family (6 adults + 1 baby).  Danielle was also super responsive, and check-in / check-out were very simple and convenient.  Overall, we had a fantastic and relaxing time, and we would highly recommend staying with Danielle and Gabriel."
6688144,60198317,2016-01-20,23759041,Susie,"Danielle and Gabriel were great, and the place was perfect for a getaway weekend with kids!  The house was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The hot tub was a special added bonus. Thanks!"
6688144,60452086,2016-01-24,4629777,Thea,"We stayed at the house during a conference at Asilomar. The location was convenient and the house was clean, well-appointed, and met our needs. The jacuzzi is a nice perk."
6688144,62563432,2016-02-15,53454339,Stephanie,Danielle was super easy to work with and very accommodating during the booking process. The property description was accurate. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. We loved that it was so close to the gate to 17 mile drive. The only disappointments were the unpleasant smell in the house and the second Bathroom tub.  I appreciate the air fresheners placed throughout the house but it did not help as our guests also mentioned there was an odor  in the house. The second bathroom has a tub that is not for elderly or bathing small children. Both of which were with us. The side of the tub is just too wide to step into.  We enjoyed our stay overall but will probably try to find another house next time. 
6688144,63335592,2016-02-22,47224072,Rebekah,"What a gem! Danielle was the perfect hostess. She was quick to respond both before and during our visit. The special little touches were amazing; even down to supplying special shampoo for blondes! The house was in a quiet neighborhood, but close to lots of stuff to do - beach, dining, shopping etc. It was exactly as presented and the perfect getaway spot for my friends and me! Highly recommend!!"
6688144,64127321,2016-02-29,58615976,Dariush,Very much with little snacks and wine :)
6688144,66489240,2016-03-22,60164718,Deeds,What a great place and experience! The house was just as described and met our needs perfectly. It's situated in a quiet and safe neighborhood with easy access to nearby attractions in the area. Danielle was a great host! She was attentive to our needs and very timely with her responses to our questions. She even left a gift for my wife (we were traveling to celebrate my wife's birthday). We would most definitely return. 
6688144,70606447,2016-04-18,28018336,Nick,"Our weekend was wonderful. Unfortunately the hot tub was not working due to a power surge a few days before we arrived, but Danielle and Gabriel made it up to us by stocking the fridge with beer and being completely available for any questions. They have even graciously offered to mail me back a few items I left at the house. And the house! Charming, quiet, a short distance from anything you'd want to do on the peninsula. Highly recommended."
6688144,71490214,2016-04-25,22029523,Tim,"We stayed for two nights during Big Sur marathon. Great house with lots of goodies. Outdoor hot spa, huge parking space, flame adjustable fireplace. It is super clean. Everything is so stylish and elegant. Highly recommended! 6-star, if 5-star is the top rank.  "
6688144,72323696,2016-05-02,63933654,Becky,"We were overjoyed with our stay! With two toddlers under the age of 3, having space to play is important. The house was perfect for our motley crew. Danielle and Gabriel went above and beyond by leaving treats, fresh robes in the closet and beautiful flowers all over the house. We felt very welcomed. Thank you for making our stay so peaceful and stress free. "
6688144,73587381,2016-05-08,49969986,Tal,"What a spot! The home is perfectly located-- a 10 minute walk to the beach and maybe a mile or so from shopping/restaurants. The house is warm, cozy, and tastefully designed. For people who enjoy cooking, the kitchen is spacious and connects to the living room and deck. Perfect for dinner w/ friends and family.

All things considered, I can't recall a better AirBnB experience than this one. Thank you Danielle and Gabriel."
6688144,74185577,2016-05-13,29513011,Nicole,Had a great stay at Danielle's home. My family and I stayed here during my wedding week. We were very busy and never got a chance to meet in person but she was great with communication throughout our booking and stay. The house is lovely and so quiet - a great escape and just what we needed during such a crazy week. 
6688144,77127764,2016-05-30,60626870,Jeff,"Upon arriving at the house we were greeted by the manager. He was trying to fix the hot tub, which never worked the whole time. The TV cable stopped working halfway through our stay. The Homeowners weren't apologetic and had the wrong attitude towards this inconvenience. I was told since I didn't mention I wanted to use the hot tub or TV, that they weren't concerned with fixing it.  We came into town for a concert for the weekend. The bathroom doesn't have any windows or an exhaust fan. After the first person took a shower it took a half an hour for the bathroom to not be super humid. The house was mince a kept up. The kitchen had no cutting board and only had a serrated knife. Took a little time to cook. Location was good. About a 20 min walk to beach. The neighbor complained for us starting our car at 9:30 am. That was a little ridiculous.  Beds were older spring beds. This doesn't compare to my bed at home so it was a little tough getting comfortable. We left the night before our last night because of it. "
6688144,78113322,2016-06-05,29890196,Sebastian,We had a great time at Danielle's place! The night that we arrived everything was ready and clean. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! 
6688144,79882403,2016-06-14,9685046,Barbara,"My husband, daughter, son-in-law, 2 granddaughters and I LOVED our stay in your spotlessly clean home.  The location was perfect because it was near the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Asilomar, the grocery store and other amenities.  My 9 year old granddaughter immediately settled in and said, ""I feel like we're home!""   One evening my granddaughters and I spotted a deer cruising the neighborhood which we thought was incredibly wonderful.  Your home was everything you advertised it would be.

Additionally, Danielle was very responsive to any of our inquiries which was very kind.  "
6688144,81115034,2016-06-21,24925547,Yang,"Came as part of my family trip. Danielle was an awesome host and the house was just as presented in the pictures.
Even though the hot tub wasn't working, the rest of the house was charming and nicely furnished."
6688144,83861542,2016-07-04,15825570,Jane,Danielle is really a kind and responsible host that I've ever met for both his house and the guests. His house is fairly lovely and well decorated. All of us love it so much!

6688144,88825557,2016-07-25,35816689,Jon,Very comfortable home proved to be the perfect place to spend a long weekend getaway 
6688144,98130206,2016-08-29,16755768,Lydia,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Danielle and Gabriel's place. The location is great for Monterey Aquarium, and right next to 17-Mile Drive. Grocery stores are very convenient as well. The home is lovely and cozy, with small touches (bottle of wine waiting for us, lots of great board games), that we appreciated. Hot tub was also a huge hit."
6688144,99913099,2016-09-06,40206709,Athena小A,"很可爱的房子,房东的回复也都很及时准确。但是后院的实际情况与描述有些不一样,那个浴池实际上是不可用的。"
6688144,101507755,2016-09-13,83682065,John,"Danielle was a fantastic host. Her communication and willingness to help on several matters was EXCELLENT! Right down to reviews on local eating areas, golf etc. Fantastic experience and highly recommend to everyone!
Wonderful accommodation and could not get a better location for playing golf at the Pebble Beach Resort.
Will definitely be back. "
6688144,105712426,2016-10-02,89001103,Nancy,Great area and close to everything Monterey.
6688144,108642814,2016-10-16,2515125,Nitya,"Overall the house is very comfortable, nicely decorated with quirky fun things, and spacious. The backyard is nice for a get-together and there is a hot tub on the property. I really liked the kitchen as it was nice and spacious, and stocked with all essential utensils. Danielle also had a bottle of wine and some snacks waiting for us when we got there, which was thoughtful. The location is good, close to major attractions around in the area. One our second night we deers in the front-yard, which was fun!

We lost power on our second night for a couple of hours, and although it was all houses in the area it was a bit inconvenient as we could not do anything but go to bed. There were emergency power lights in each bedroom but only one was working, the house did have a few candles we could use. Our only major issue was one of my friends in our party developed a rash immediately after the trip, and we think the hot tub may have been the culprit.

By mistake we took one of the house keys while leaving, we realized it was either packed in one of bags or inside the house but it was already checkout time so we decided to search thoroughly later. Danielle was accommodating and let us mail her back the key which we found later after reaching the bay area, which I appreciate.

"
6688144,123784020,2016-12-30,44628943,Dmitry,"We've spent almost a week at this wonderful house and could not have been happier with the location, amenities, and comfort! The house was spacious enough for 2 adults and 3 kids, and the owners thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable!"
6688144,131561268,2017-02-12,64055237,Eric,Danielle and Gabriel are very hospitable and accommodating. They made sure we had everything we needed and thoughtful tips and instructions on the house and surrounding area. We would absolutely stay again in the future.

6688144,136921027,2017-03-12,38435793,Dana,"We really enjoyed our weekend stay here.  We were 3 couples visiting a friend in Monterey.  Danielle was very communicative.  The house was very comfortable and the jacuzzi was a great amenity.  We went to the Monterey Aquarium, went to lunch in Carmel followed by a wine tasting room and a beautiful sunset, and then spent the last day playing beach volleyball and enjoying the weather.  Overall, I would recommend Danielle and Gabriel's place! "
6688144,139883095,2017-03-26,16337630,Renee,"We had a wonderful time staying here. This was a great place to stay during the weekend while we took our daughter to the aquarium for the first time. The house was very comfortable and spacious, and the hot tub was a great spot to unwind after our toddler was down for the night. We also enjoyed how quiet it was at night - great for relaxing and sleeping well. Our daughter will be talking about how much fun she had for a long time!"
6688144,142911428,2017-04-09,16434001,Jonathan,Super location for a Monterey weekend! Asilomar beach beautiful with kids. 
6688144,144846392,2017-04-16,71019922,Chris,This is a wonderful house. It is very cozy and nicely decorated. The bedrooms are nice and the beds comfortable. The kitchen and family room is very open and user friendly. We would absolutely stay here again. Give this house a try. We do not think you will be disappointed. 
6688144,147236660,2017-04-25,111997486,Ola,"We had a great time in Pacific Groves staying 4 days in April at Danielle and Gabriel's house. The location was good with easy access to the sea and the 17-mile drive. We also went to Carmel and Big Sur which are really lovely places. The house is large and comfortable, and we appreciated things like the outdoor gas grill, the spa and the kitchen which contains everything you need to cook a nice dinner! Danielle really cared for our well-being and comfort, she was responding quickly to our messages and fixing things that needed attention like replacing a dinner plate that we accidentally broke. Thanks!"
6688144,151035164,2017-05-10,62850079,Layne,"Perfect location to walk to Montrey waterside! Convenient to 17 mile scenic drive. We biked it to Peeble Beach, was a perfect day! Also, convenient drive to Carmel. Quiet neighborhood, lovely outdoor space. Great accommodations . Would definitely recommend! "

6688144,166785448,2017-07-04,122705263,Jack,"Great house close to most everything in Pacific Grove. We just minutes from the beach, downtown, and the waterfront. The house is well-maintained and spacious enough. There is only one TV, which was a non-issue for us. We would definitely stay here again. "
6688144,168015666,2017-07-08,74514800,Sophia,"The house is in a great location. Also, the picture portrays the property perfectly so there are no surprises. Unfortunately, the owner wasn't able to accommodate an early check-in (check-in was at 3pm and I asked for 1:30pm) which was disappointing on our part. However, if that is a non-issue for you, then you'll be fine. "
6688144,176747355,2017-07-31,80068185,Kevin,Our hosts were wonderful in their communication and preparing us for our stay.  Their home was beautiful and comfortable and relaxing and (central and near) to all our destinations.  Don't miss out!
6688144,179904918,2017-08-08,31751144,Carol,The home is in a great location.  Just minutes to downtown Pacific Grove.  Quiet residential neighborhood.  Very nice home. The owners were very easy to work with.  This was a golf trip and the home was perfect for our needs!
6688144,182411726,2017-08-14,71828848,Michael,The home was beautiful. It was equipped with all the essentials. We enjoyed a beautiful family vacation. Close to all the attractions we were interested in. We would stay again. Highly recommend.
6688144,184955286,2017-08-20,107471168,Collin,"We stayed for the 2017 Monterey car week and had a great stay. It would have been hard to beat the price, location and quality."
6688144,192978920,2017-09-11,133951205,Banjie,"We loved that the area was quiet and peaceful, even saw a few bucks/does.
The house had everything we needed, there was space to sit around and talk even from the kitchen to the living room. We did not use the TV much but it was available. It was good to have two full bathrooms since we had to prepare for events at the same time. Like any house near the sea, there is the musty smell. You get used to it after a while or if you open the windows."
6688144,197143314,2017-09-24,21804134,Kara-Lea,"Quick, concise, considerate and an awesome home well taken care of. It had everything we needed. A perfect fit for our adult trip!"
6688144,201138057,2017-10-07,118768575,Angela,"很不错的房子,温馨舒适,有家的感觉!"
6688144,204125768,2017-10-16,59903881,Yvonne,The house had everything we needed and was in a great location. The hosts had great communication with us.
6688144,205805799,2017-10-22,5533072,Joseph,"Great communication, great location. We veryuch enjoyed our stay!"
6688144,209944992,2017-11-06,73653609,Thomas,"With a central location between Carmel, Monterey, the coast and Pacific Grove, we really enjoyed our stay. Danielle was an attentive host, sharing her local favorites and super easy to communicate with. The house is spacious and well laid out.  Our two Frenchies LOVED the closed in backyard and sunny deck.

Food tips:  Pavel’s Backerei for pastries, Red House Cafe for breakfast and Patisserie Bechler for sweets. Pacific Grove and Carmel are super dog friendly. Try Terry’s Lounge in Carmel’s Cypress Hotel for a dog friendly tasty lunch with great Bloody Marys.

 (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a nice and varied option for food delivery."
6688144,211651620,2017-11-13,26826666,Tom,"Very nice 3-bedroom home. Quiet and comfortable neighborhood. I recommend this place. We cooked several meals. Kitchen was mostly adequate. Bring some extra trash bags, toilet paper, and tissues. No local or national tv is available at this place but we still had a great time!
Host was very good with her communication."
6688144,213733729,2017-11-22,113910013,Mike,Great location for all that the Monterey peninsula has to offer.  The home was very clean and Danielle was a great host with very fast and helpful communications.  I would highly recommend staying at this home or at any home Danielle has to offer.
6688144,216438068,2017-12-03,10888872,Richard,"This house is pretty sweet.  The description on the website provides every thing you need to know.  
We are a group of math teachers and we  attend a conference every year that is about a 15 min walk from the house, so the 6 of us have shared it two years in a row.  We sat up each night in front of the fireplace and had long discussions about the day's events and shared our experiences.  We easily walked to the grocery store to pick up extra supplies and used the well stocked kitchen to cook all our meals. 
I can pretty much guarantee that any questions you have, Danielle will address and respond quickly."
6688144,223135636,2017-12-31,39969753,David,"I would give 3.5 stars if I could. We enjoyed our stay: the location is quite good, the hot tub was clean and a good temp, and the beds were comfortable. The few issues we had were with the kitchen. It isn't particularly set up for cooking, with only one ""frozen food"" knife and no regular kitchen knives (Danielle mentioned a guest complained about knives being dangerous for kids). The dishwasher door tries to close on you whenever you're putting dishes in. Some of the place mats were dirty and the (outdoor) grill needed a good cleaning before we could use it. None of this was a deal-breaker and if you're mostly planning on eating out it wouldn't bother you. Bar these minor issues we had a good visit. I should also mention Danielle was very responsive despite traveling herself while we were there."
6688144,234163716,2018-02-11,64055237,Eric,"Danielle and Gabriel were very accommodating and easy to work with. I had no issues and the house was as advertised. I would definitely stay again, and recommend the house.

Thanks!"
6688144,238464624,2018-02-25,14994563,Hudson,"My parents (60+ yrs), my sister and I (30+) stayed at this place over a chilly weekend. The fireplace and the living room was a huge hit for us, as it kept us cozy and warm. The outdoor grill worked really well as we cooked steak on it, and the dining and kitchen area were fully stocked for us to eat. We haven’t stayed in a suburban home together in over 15 years, and we all really appreciated how it made us feel like we were home again as a family."
6688144,244446642,2018-03-18,169504183,Ellen,Danielle and Gabriel have a very cozy and clean home. The size was just perfect for our family of 6 adults and a dog. The location is close to everything and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
6688144,249198373,2018-04-01,112952566,Terra,"The house was very clean, and easy to get into. We were a bachelorette party and Danielle very sweetly left us balloons. The location is great! The house is a short walk from pebble beach and a quick Uber from downtown. Our only issue was we were really looking forward to using the jacuzzi, but it was broken. We were told we would be updated on the jacuzzi being repaired and assured that it would most likely be in time for our arrival. We had to reach out to the host just 2 weeks prior to our arrival and were told the jacuzzi would not be fixed in time. When I voiced concern about the jacuzzis lack of repair we were encouraged to cancel our trip very close to our arrival date."
6688144,251890194,2018-04-08,37849672,Kate,"This home is centrally located making it an effective launchpad for the many activities that Monterey has to offer. Danielle is very nice and responds quickly. The bottle of wine and snacks she left was a thoughtful touch. Please note the following when considering this rental: The home is on a frequently used street and near a high school, so there is traffic noise and cars driving by quickly. Upon arrival, my fellow travelers and I were overwhelmed with the potent air-fresheners being used throughout the house. Migraines and coughing ensued. We had to locate and unplug the air-fresheners (which we of course we plugged back in upon departure). Over the next day, the smell of air-freshener was replaced by a strong musty smell (perhaps mold?), especially from the master bedroom. In the common bathroom, one must either straddle (or sit on) a substantial tile wall in order to enter the shower/tub (see picture in listing). There are no bars to grab onto. If you (or someone in your group) has any kind of mobility concerns, I would advise not using this shower/tub. In addition, there is mold in the tile grout, rust on the shower curtain bar, and the shower curtain liner is in need of replacement. I specifically booked this rental because a hot tub was listed as an amenity. Before my trip, I proactively checked in with the host regarding the hot tub, who informed me that it was not working. This was disappointing. As it clearly states in the listing, there are security cameras on the entrances, exits and driveway of this property, so presumably your comings and goings will be monitored."
7104624,43078516,2015-08-17,37823438,Paul,"The neighborhood was beautiful and very unique--a trip back in time. The home was even better than pictured--comfortably furnished and exceedingly clean.  The hosts made us feel welcome at first arrival.      
A welcome message board on the counter, 2 bottles of wine, local honey and homemade cookies were ours to enjoy. While this in an historic home, all modern amenities were tastefully incorporated to the 1904 structure. Our hosts left personal touches such as robes, pumice stone, facial cleansing wipes, beach towels and beach chairs that were totally unexpected.
in addition, we were left a detailed packet of local points of 
interest, eateries, brochures and maps, instructions for television, note to explain location of needed additional linens, etc. We were also given passes to the Monterrey Aquarium which was amazing, beautiful and informative.
We felt like we were staying with friends who had looked forward to our arrival with great anticipation and planning. 
The renovation of this historical home was done with great care, thoughtfulness and a tremendous amount of talent--construction and decorating. There was no feeling of furnishing in a left-over or careless style.  In all, this was a very well thought-out and welcoming home. We stayed three nights and regretted having to leave. If we had it to do over, we would have reversed our trip and ended our week in California in Pacific Grove at 225 Congress as this was definitely the BEST part of our vacation. We are already making plans to return."
7104624,50704767,2015-10-13,1219029,Ed,The house is fantastic. 2 minutes walk away from the main street and beside a lovely restaurant - Passionfish. Jeff and Carol and left a chilled bottle of wine and fresh cookies for us. We'll stay in this house every time we visit Carmel if it's available! 
7104624,53624686,2015-11-10,598467,Kevin,"The home was beautiful. The beds were amazing. The location was great. Parking was easy. We're already plotting a return trip. Jeff and Carol were amazingly responsive, friendly, and helpful. Nothing but kudos."
7104624,58821571,2016-01-05,14266640,Napier,"A gem in downtown Pacific Grove! Our family loved staying here. Plenty of space for us all to enjoy a New Year's holiday in one of our favorite spots on the coast. We loved the fireplace, plush beds and sunny kitchen. The vintage décor is fun and echoes the home's history. The location is perfect for walking to PG restaurants and the cinema. We enjoyed the homemade chocolate chip cookies left for us, too! "
7104624,64846858,2016-03-08,549552,Jessica,"We could not have been more pleased with our stay here.  Jeff and Carol are the perfect hosts.  If you're looking for a beautiful and relaxing place to stay while visiting the charming town of Pacific Grove, look no further...this is it!  We LOVED the location.  You're walking distance to the ocean, shops and restaurants.  As for the house, there is so much to love.   It's spacious yet cozy, tastefully designed and the beds are super comfy.  Jeff and Carol, thank you for everything!"
7104624,70654592,2016-04-19,17499139,Rick,"This is a beautifully restored home within walking distance to Lovers Point Park by the water. The house has a very cozy interior design and we all immediately felt right at home. Jeff and Carol made us feel very welcome with some fresh baked cookies and wine. This is a quiet neighborhood and street parking was always available, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance.  

"
7104624,71373680,2016-04-25,55721586,Sara,"I loved staying in Pacific Grove at this wonderful house. The bedrooms were very comfortable and the kitchen was well-appointed. I especially enjoyed all of the flowers in the outdoor spaces. It was the perfect base for my planned adventures in Monterey and Big Sur, and I appreciated Carol and Jeff's advice on restaurants in Pacific Grove."
7104624,72154307,2016-05-01,66445888,Charyl,"This was our first Airbnb experience! It was fantastic! Jeff and Carol were very prompt on every question. The house was better in person than the beautiful pictures on the website. Location was great, house cozy and immaculate. Very high end finishes and lovely personal touches. Wine, bottled water, cookies, (yummy) and several thoughtful birthday surprises! Everything was wonderful! We are already talking with friends about another getaway to this historic home! We will be returning, that is for sure! Best small beach town we have visited, friendly, easy parking, although we walked most of the time! Loved the experience! Thank you for having us! "
7104624,77140973,2016-05-30,4488755,Martha,"What a beautiful home and gracious hosts. They were quick to answer all our questions and had great suggestions for restaurants. Everything was thought of, robes, shampoos, chocolate chip cookies and wine.  The neighborhood is quiet and the house centrally located. We rarely drove. The rooms are eve better than the pictures. We will be back!!!"
7104624,80507204,2016-06-18,41948889,Jake,This house is gorgeous and cozy. Very close to the water and food and parks... This is the  spot for Monterey or Pacific Grove. The hosts were wonderful and gave recommendations and we're always able to help. 
7104624,82532052,2016-06-28,48416198,Colleen,"We loved our stay at this beautifully restored historic home!  The pictures did not do this property justice.  Upon arriving we were greeted with a welcome bottle of wine from our hosts.  The home was warm and inviting with all the upgraded amenities anyone could want.  The master bedroom was large with isn't own fireplace and a very comfortable king bed.  The sunny second bedroom was just as large with same attention to detail as the rest of the home.  There were plenty luxurious linens and towels provided for our 6 day stay.  We especially loved coming home at the end of our day and relaxing in the family room.  There was another separate sitting area with a cozy couch and two chairs that faced large inviting fireplace.  We didn't spend much time cooking, but the kitchen was fully stoked with everything you would need to whip up a gourmet meal.  Out the backdoor was a well appointed deck with a grill and even a small hot tub!  We walked everywhere. You are located one block from downtown PG restaurants and five blocks to the ocean/ocean trail.  The complimentary passes to Monterey Bay Aquarium was an added bonus.  I'm happy we found our home-away-from-home in PG.  We will be back again soon!  "
7104624,90608694,2016-08-01,60120738,Caroline,"We had a really great stay at Carol and Jeff's lovely heritage home.   It's beautifully decorated throughout, well equipped and very comfortable with lots of space.  Carol and Jeff are great and thoughtful hosts, providing high quality linens and toiletries as well as lots of useful information about the local area.  Communication was easy and friendly. We really appreciated the delicious home made cookies and wine on arrival too! The house is in a quiet residential area in the quaint and pretty town of Pacific Grove.   Altogether we loved it and very much hope to return!  Highly recommended.  "
7104624,103075811,2016-09-20,5612902,Kevin,We showed up earlier than we were supposed but Carol took great care of us anyway and even provided us with great chair pads for the Jazz Festival. The house is great and very comfy. Less than a block from the main drag in Pacific Grove. All positive!
7104624,113974239,2016-11-14,101441414,Lacey,Our stay was great! Beautiful home and awesome location! 
7104624,185085194,2017-08-20,6393892,Brian,Jeff and Carol's home was awesome! It was everything and more than expected. The home is super clean and the beds are very comfortable. Looking forward to visiting again soon.
7104624,248135079,2018-03-30,58949848,Rorie,"Terrific communication; well-appointed and stylish house; quiet neighborhood; easy access to beach, Aquarium, restaurants from a walk, bike, or quick drive. Carol and Jeff went out of their way to make us welcome (and even mailed my son's glasses to him priority mail the next day after we left). Highly recommend!"
7126880,40254442,2015-07-29,10849042,Debbie,"David was great in communicating with me before our arrival and was there to greet us.
We did, experience a snafou with the house not being ready at the designated check-in time and a mishap with keys, but David was apologetic and responded quickly.
This is a home that has been well lived in over the years and has a rustic charm to it,lots of nooks and crannies for the kids to explore and have fun. We did feel, however, that the home needs a complete refresher and some TLC. Pacific Grove is a wonderful community and the home is in a super location to allow the exploration of the Monterey, Carmel area!"
7126880,42159670,2015-08-11,37664442,Catharine,"Great stay in Pacific Grove, a lovely town, a lovely neighborhood and a lovely home.  David was a good host - wine and flowers on arrival. Seamless check-in.  The house is really adorable, cozy, charming and warm.  Only one shower was a challenge with 6 people but we managed well.  The house while charming is showing its age a bit with some cracked plaster around and chairs that seemed more decorative than useful- but any negative was minor and more than made up with the wonders of the town, neighborhood and overall warmth of the home. I give a very strong recomendation for this home. Thanks."
7126880,44565116,2015-08-27,15905777,Tom,"David's vacation home in Pacific Grove is amazing! For a one hundred year old home, you get all the charm of grandma's house with the conveniences of a modern living. There were 3 of us, but I could see the home accommodating twice that, plus some kids. (Especially if you were frugal with your bathroom time and the kids didn't mind sleeping bags.) First, there's ample living space - TWO dining areas, TWO living areas - so there's plenty of places to stretch out, read a book, watch TV, play a board game, what have you. All while you're surrounded by classic details: stained glass windows, hardwood floors, and custom woodwork. Second, the kitchen is large and with modern appliances (be aware, no dishwasher though). The upstairs bathroom has a walk in shower, and the downstairs a tub (perfect for the kids). Finally, the home is within walking distance of shops and restaurants, and an easy, 5 minute drive to the aquarium and tourist spots. We also took a trip down the PCH and this served as a great home base. In all, this home was perfect for us - right combination of location, conveniences, and charm."
7126880,53453661,2015-11-09,19522644,Katherine,"David was a great host! He was very hands off, but also gave us plenty of information to make our stay easy to coordinate. The house is definitely charming and a bit rustic, with plenty of space for a large group. It's also located very close to downtown Monterrey and Lover's Point (the beach). There's also a fireplace. Overall, a very cozy stay!"
7126880,60049491,2016-01-18,29292687,Allison,"David was responsive and very flexible; which was so important when traveling with 7 people.   (2adults/5kids). He quickly responded to all our questions and accommodated our various needs.  
The house was definitely Victorian and a bit on the funky or quirky side  in a FANTASTIC neighborhood; homey and eclectic.   The home is large and welcoming. Amazing amount of space and sleeping configurations for the price.  Plenty of space to spread out. Nice kitchen. Big dining room.  Good and plenty of tables and chairs for games. Clean towels and sheets.  "
7126880,60461297,2016-01-24,10022314,Alison,"A lovely home with lots of character and plenty of space for sleeping, lounging, and eating. David was responsive and helpful. We loved our stay! Thanks!"
7126880,62497095,2016-02-15,50216507,Brad,"The house in Pacific Grove was described very well in the information provided.  It is in a great area that is private, yet within easy walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove.  The house was clean and everything worked well for our needs.  I would recommend the house for anybody interested in enjoying Pacific Grove and surrounding areas!  David was a great host!"
7126880,68674373,2016-04-06,12361806,Stephen,Excellent location.  David was easy to reach and very accommodating.  Vintage home home and furnishings. Clean and comfortable.  Would rent this house again.
7126880,70398224,2016-04-17,22299687,Chris,"Great place, clean, but with vintage charm and in a quiet, desirable Pacific Grove neighborhood. Plenty of space as well, I will definitely try to book this home again when my travels take me down to the Monterey peninsula. "
7126880,71273717,2016-04-24,55013941,Michael,David's house was an excellent place to stay while in the Monterey / Pacific Grove area. Within walking distance of Pacific Grove and Lover's Point. The house and beds were very comfortable and easily slept 6 with room for more. The house was clean and everything went very well. David sent me a text to make sure all was going well but otherwise let us enjoy our privacy. Would love to stay here again on our next trip!
7126880,71568886,2016-04-26,26176482,Wen,Great house with great location. We spend just two days there but had wonderful memory. Recommend family with kids. Hope to visited again!
7126880,72242289,2016-05-01,7901376,Victoria,Wonderful home and in a perfect location to walk to everything! An amazing old Victorian house that had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and very welcoming. David was very responsive to all communication! We can't wait to visit again.
7126880,75911897,2016-05-23,16878345,Jon,"David welcomed us by telephone and provided access and parking info.  This was a perfect fit for myself, my wife and her two sisters, each requiring their own space.  Many endearing features from the bays to the beautiful fireplace surround with built in bookcases on either side.  An easy walk to Lighthouse Ave and an excellent Italian dinner one evening.  Parking on Laurel was plentiful for our guests and us.  A very successful graduation weekend for my daughter."
7126880,79595304,2016-06-13,70711586,Wenqiang,Dave is an excellent host. He responded all the requests very fast and was very passionate. We enjoyed the trip in Monterey.
7126880,88006164,2016-07-22,53530448,Ashley,"Arrival was very easy, even though we arrived early. Parking was no problem and the house was as described. Lots of space and character. It was a delight to stay here. Loved Pacific Grove and Monterey. The local area was quiet and friendly, could walk to most things and Uber was generally available."
7126880,90657497,2016-08-01,50232947,Gina,"I booked the ""Charming Victorian"" as a place for me and a few of my out-of-town bridesmaids to stay while we were in Monterey for my wedding.  I was looking for a spacious home that could accommodate the four of us.

The home is, indeed, charming, and it has the important amenities such as towels, coffee maker, utensils, etc. The Victorian-era details, down to the dressers, the sink, the decor made it a more unique experience. The home was clean and the location was perfect--close to the water, to downtown Pacific Grove, and to grocery stores. While I didn't spend as much time at the home as my bridesmaids did, I know we all thoroughly enjoyed it.

David was very helpful, including addressing a confusing situation with a family member who mistakenly thought they were staying at this AirBnB.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thank you for a wonderful experience, David, and for contributing to making my wedding weekend special!"
7126880,91374967,2016-08-05,59743112,Lori,"We had a stupendous stay in Pacific Grove. 

We were very weary after a few manic days in San Francisco and we walked into this spacious and comfortable home and were just delighted.  I decided straight away that we needed more time here and very fortunately was able to extend our stay by one more night.  This allowed us to fully relax and also do other things as well as whale watching in Monterey. 

Spotlessly clean, wonderful shower and we slept like babies. This house provides a family with everything it needs or wants and then some. Very safe neighbourhood and a short walk to town where there's an excellent choice of places to eat and shop. 

We had a leisurely stroll to the lighthouse and saw so much wildlife on the way. Quite unbelievable. It's paradise. "
7126880,101056764,2016-09-11,37901935,Laura,"My family and I absolutely loved this beautiful Pacific Grove Victorian house! I must say the property description and photos were accurate and I was very impressed when I arrived. The house appears to be well-maintained and was very clean including the patio areas. The kitchen was spotless and furnished with every dish and utensils that we needed.  I especially liked the location with everything close,there's a french bakery down the street that is to die for....a must visit when here. I had no issues whatsoever and would 100% choose this house as my vacation rental again.  I would certainly recommend this house to anyone!

Thank you David for an amazing vacation/wedding stay!!

7126880,102352589,2016-09-17,24319328,Angelo,Our host was very easy to communicate with. He left us a bottle of wine and fresh flowers which were nice touches. The neighborhood was great with many things at a walkable distance from the house. The house had a positive energy of being lived in.
7126880,115561284,2016-11-25,15647721,Oliver,David was very responsive and welcoming. The house was charming and had just the comfortable and charming feel we wanted for our family stay. The location was great for walks to the coast and downtown Pacific Grove. An all around great experience.

place!"
7126880,123364020,2016-12-28,6675509,Alison,"This place was perfect for our family of 6 adults.  We enjoyed the privacy of 3 separate bedrooms and the spaciousness of the communal living space.  The kitchen was well-stocked and also spacious.  There were extra mattresses in the bedrooms that we made use of.  Wi-fi was also helpful.  
Many of my picky family members complimented me for choosing this home for our stay.  It was a perfect walking distance from other relatives who were visiting, and the three separate bedrooms made for plenty of privacy and ease in our co-habitation.  The spaciousness downstairs was also well appreciated.  
The location is within walking distance of the beach and the small downtown. The house is gorgeous.  Stained-glass windows and wood floors accent the beauty of the architecture.  It was a treat to stay in a home so different from our own for a few days. "
7126880,127244115,2017-01-16,43376743,Anna,"The place is extremely cozy,  it's an old building with a nice atmosphere and lots of old pictures,  lamps,  musical instruments, pillows and other stuff that make a house into a home. The hosts are very helpful and nice and are willing to help with any troubles or requests. There's lots of space for sleeping. The location is great."
7126880,144836849,2017-04-16,115957781,Christine,"Great place to stay, especially if traveling with a group. Spacious, charming house with a wonderful yard & fire pit."
7126880,146764968,2017-04-23,56103687,Chris,Davids house is awesome and he was a great host. We look forward to staying again next time we are in the Monterey area.
7126880,152833217,2017-05-18,5725717,Susan,"David's home is near the top of a hill - a brief, breezy downhill walk to the restaurants, shops, post office, museum, and waterfront of Pacific Grove. It was a perfect accommodation for our family (Susan and me and our two sons in their 20's) - three upstairs bedrooms and a spacious bathroom with a large, walk in shower. We enjoyed the spaciousness, charm, and utility of the house - a window seat in the living room, a separate dining room with a large table that is perfect for writing emails, planning activities, or studying; a roomy kitchen with lovely wooden counters (use provided cutting boards to protect it) and modern fridge and stove. The grill is great, but plan to cook before it gets dark (or bring a flashlight). The laundry came in handy. It is in the basement, and is reached from the back of the house. - again might be easier to use before it gets dark. This home is a very comfortable place for a family of four to spend several days, while enjoying and exploring Pacific Grove and the magnificent surroundings."

7126880,197141457,2017-09-24,7381380,Jasmin,A group of friends and I were in town for a wedding in Carmel. David's place was the perfect home for us that weekend! It is in a great location with lots of restaurants and amenities nearby.

7126880,200202966,2017-10-04,49073744,Kim,"A home away from home. Very warm and welcoming. David is very good and fast at communication, and directions are clear and simple. 
The house is perfectly located for both a relaxing vacation in Pacific Grove, and for sight seeing in the area. 
The house works really well for a larger family - we where 6 and that was very smooth. Kitchen is well equipped, and if you don't want to cook yourself, very good restaurants and diners are within walking distance. 
We loved it here, and David and his house comes highly recommended."
7126880,204361385,2017-10-17,2811526,Jonathan,"Great, spacious house, in excellent neighborhood in adorable pacific grove.  Clean and spacious with a great outside space.  David was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the process.  The house, while charming, is showing some signs of wear and tear, but is an incredible value for the size and location."

7126880,219524322,2017-12-17,15358416,Colleen,"I love this house!  So charming, great location, and David is an excellent host.  I stayed here with my sister, her husband, my niece (a toddler) and my three kids (ages 9, 7, and 4), and the house suited us perfectly.  I have nothing but great things to say about our weekend stay here!"
7126880,222812878,2017-12-30,6121097,John,"Davids Victorian
What a great location! We walked everywhere and we felt very safe there. The kitchen is fully stocked, but lacks a dishwasher so for larger groups, be prepared. Bedrooms are spacious and very comfortable. We loved the view from upstairs and you can see a pretty sunrise. The backyard has a great grill and patio perfect for late night dinners. The neighborhood is quiet and charming, Pacific Grove is darling! Wonderful area!"
7126880,223816417,2018-01-01,152922479,Omead,"Great home with old-time touches. Propane fire pit was incredible. Walking distance to an awesome coffee shop, and a mile away from Trader Joe's. David was instant with communication. Would stay again!"
7126880,226612265,2018-01-11,10346299,Thomas,A delightfully charming home in a great location.  David was a perfect host and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience there.

7126880,236241131,2018-02-18,19993507,Anthony,David's place was very charming and in a fantastic location. Was perfect for our group. Would definitely stay there again!
7126880,237360886,2018-02-22,34318181,Dena,Dave's place was so charming and cute with it's old world charm. It is quite spacious and was very comfortable. They had a lot of amenities in the kitchen which was very useful. The location was perfect and centrally located to where we wanted to be. Communication was so prompt and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
7126880,240451548,2018-03-04,144343506,Josh,"The house was really comfortable and homey, it's an old house with a lot of the original character including some cool period appropriate wallpaper. We especially enjoyed the big kitchen and the comfy living room. The weather was rainy so we got some firewood and had a fire in the fireplace and listened to the rain on the roof."
7126880,247810019,2018-03-29,46291105,Robert,Location is fantastic.  Home is authentic Victorian.  Excellent supplies.
7292129,43636483,2015-08-21,28439491,Richard,"Kristina was great.  She kept us updated during the weeks prior to the stay and the house was lovely too.  Just been redone, we were its first residents, and it didn't disappoint.  Quiet road, and close to beaches and other amenities in the Monterey area.  Thank you Kristina for all your help, I am sure we will be back next year."
7292129,44574621,2015-08-27,26916994,Dylan,"Kristina was a good host...clear communication and flexibility that allowed us to arrive very late at the accommodation.  The house is very well presented, with excellent kitchen facilities and excellent showers in a great area.  Some really good cafes and restuarants down the road - we particularly liked Bookworks."
7292129,53545194,2015-11-09,47649423,Patrick,"Nous avons passé une semaine merveilleuse chez Kristina au Charming Pacific Grove cottage.
Le cottage est extrêmement bien équipé et tout était mis en place (fournitures douche, cuisine, serviettes de douche) pour que l'on se sente accueilli, comme chez nous.
La rue et le voisinage sont extrêmement calmes, l'emplacement est idéal.
Nous le recommanderons avec enthousiasme
Patrick et Laurence"
7292129,55219317,2015-11-29,45994605,Karen,The cottage was perfect for family at Thanksgiving! It was immaculate and the kitchen was stocked with everything I needed to cook some amazing meals. The location was quiet and close to the wharf & beach. I'd definitely want to go back!
7292129,57670347,2015-12-28,49378975,Malini,"Kristina was easy to contact, provided directions and had set up the interior well - stocked with basics like salt, pepper, oil etc in kitchen, towels, paper towels, napkins, extra toilet paper, blankets etc.
Building looked unimpressive from the outside, but was very nice inside. Great location blocks from the ocean. "
7292129,58875652,2016-01-05,2722676,Patricia,Kristina was at the house when we arrived and briefly welcomed us so we could get settled. Everything was in order and the house was just as advertised. The beds were very comfortable and the house was perfect for our group of five. The neighborhood was quiet for a great night's sleep. The neighbors were also very friendly. We appreciated the fully stocked kitchen since we wanted to have a nice dinner at home during our stay. The house is in a great location for a run/walk along the coast. We loved the rustic charm of the cozy home and would not hesitate to stay at this location again.
7292129,60478065,2016-01-24,23030347,Matt,Great stay in this cottage. It was clean and comfortable. All as described. Easy in and out. Great location! Thanks for a great stay.
7292129,62839568,2016-02-17,4871789,Betsy,"We had a wonderful long weekend in the Chestnut cottage. It was bright and clean and there was plenty of room for the 4 of us. The home was in a great neighborhood and the perfect jumping off point to explore Pacific Grove, Monterey and Carmel!"
7292129,67647547,2016-03-30,29149294,Julia,"This is a cute little house , close to the ocean and a park. It is located on the 17 miles drive. We were 5 and the house fit us perfectly. We were cooking and eating in a lot, all the necessary utensils are available. Check -in/out procedure was very simple and seamless. From the negatives - we did not find a hair dryer; Internet was very slow; and there are ants in the house - we did not care much, but might be an issue for some people. "
7292129,75871416,2016-05-23,30502782,Sue,"The home is tastefully furnished and comfortable.  My husband and I and two adult sons spent three nights in the home.  The home is in a quiet neighborhood, and we found it in clean and organized condition.  I especially like the first floor bath, with its rain shower.  There is a doe and a buck that frequent the neighborhood, and the doe visited our yard during our stay.  The coastal air is refreshing, and we spent Sunday evening at the nearby state park that has white, sugar-sand beaches.  So lovely to watch the sun set.  It is a little slice of paradise."
7292129,77668648,2016-06-02,15643316,Janée,"We had a wonderful time at the Chestnut Cottage. If you want a great home base for exploring Pacific Grove, Asilomar, Monterey, Big Sur, and Salinas, you can't ask for a better location. The cottage comfortably accommodates six adults, and is well appointed. We were pleased to see that Kristina had anticipated needs---everything you need (dishes, towels, laundry soap) is easy to find, and in good order. The bathrooms are beautiful and the en suite bathroom on the second floor is particularly luxurious. All of us remarked that our beds  and linens were very comfortable and that we slept extraordinarily well. Overall, a great experience, and everyone seems keen to return.

When we arrived there was a leak in the downstairs bathroom at the shut-off valve, but it was one of those things that just happens, and Kristina quickly resolved the issue. She dispatched a plumber right away, and the fix took maybe ten minutes once he arrived. There were no more plumbing issues during our stay. The only other problem was the ants. When we first arrived there were a few in the upstairs shower, but as our stay progressed we found we needed to use the provided ant traps, and we had to deal with them in greater abundance in both bathrooms, one of the downstairs bedrooms, and the kitchen. We were very clean, but they were persistent. They were a nuisance, and made it necessary to do a lot more laundry (I found ants on the towels, my father had some get into his suitcase), but we were able to manage it. From what I understand from my in-laws who had previously stayed at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, ants are common in the area, so I don't believe they were a reflection on Kristina's care for the house (which was otherwise very clean), but perhaps it's time to spray the perimeter again. Overall, the house perfectly met our needs, and was a great value for the area. Kristina's responsiveness impressed me---it's nice to know that in the unlikely event something goes wrong, she handles things promptly and with a great attitude.

Thanks for a lovely family vacation, we made some great memories at the Chestnut Cottage!"
7292129,81118996,2016-06-21,68226320,Kristin,"Chestnut cottage was ideal for our four-day weekend stay! 
There's plenty of room and the downstairs was beyond comfortable; everything you need in the kitchen, which made things easy and convenient.
The beds were really comfortable and the bathrooms were beautiful and functional. Especially love the showerhead in the downstairs bathroom. (Rain) 
The cottage was affordable, comfortable, and conveniently located - the perfect place for a girls weekend getaway. We will definitely be back. 
Easy check in and out and no problems accessing the property. Thanks for a great experience! "
7292129,84261265,2016-07-06,5078437,Peggy,"The house was a cute cottage on a quiet residential street at the top of the hill in Pacific Grove. We had a great time, and my son made friends with the kids across the street. The house came as advertised, with three good sized bedrooms, a functional kitchen with a somewhat funky layout, and a small living area. Overall, it fit our group very well (two grandparents, two parents, a kindergartner and an infant) and we had a great weekend. While totally functional, the house does not have high end finishes and a few little things were amiss - for example, there was a broken faceplate on electrical outlet, and we couldn't find a corkscrew. Yet the price is right and Kristina was helpful and friendly. "
7292129,85907195,2016-07-13,40819908,Jane,"Our host was friendly and helpful.  The house was clean, delightful and well equipped for the most part.  Expect an old creaky house (noted by us because of sleeping small grandchildren so each footstep was loud - but it is an old house!! - LOL).  The outdoor sitting areas are lovely and we really enjoyed and used that space.  There was a basket of beach towels etc.  Very nice touch.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  There were a bunch of board games too.  The bathrooms have been beautifully remodeled.  I had not noticed there was no bathtub so my 7 month old grandson had his first shower!!  The neighborhood is quaint and in easy reach of the local attractions.  "
7292129,91754168,2016-08-06,2600787,Daniel,"Our family enjoyed our stay at this house. The outdoor spaces in the front and back yards were nice for a quiet cup of tea, and the house itself was spacious. The beds and sheets were very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet, and it was an easy walk to downtown Pacific Grove for a nice selection of restaurants and the beach. Kristina was good at communicating all the necessary information prior to our arrival."
7292129,93720333,2016-08-13,18878248,Anika,"We had a wonderful holiday staying here! Spacious home with room for my family of 6.  It was a quiet, peaceful area perfectly located close to the downtown Pacific Grove strip and the beaches.
Definitely a repeat location!! Loved every minute of our stay!"
7292129,95661973,2016-08-20,81477882,Moshe,"We stayed 3 nights at this cottage, it was amazing! Kristina is really kind and was always available when i texted her, 9 min away from Monterey bay area and center, in the kitchen you'll find everything you need if you're planing to cook, the house was very very clean. this place getting 5 STARS FROM ME and i wish i could give it more!"
7292129,99669108,2016-09-05,48434927,Kristin,"This cottage was wonderful for three couples in town for a weekend wedding at Lover's Point.  It is a charming home that fit our needs perfectly.  We could walk to ""town"" and the beach and a short drive to other Monterey sights.  Though we ended up eating out all weekend, the kitchen seemed to have everything necessary to prepare meals.  The beds were very comfortable with super soft sheets.  Even a view of the water from the top deck!"
7292129,101295088,2016-09-12,85872542,Heather,"Kristina was wonderful to work with and we appreciate everything she did for us.  The house was charming and clean.  The updated bathrooms were very nice.  Since the houses in Pacific Grove are old, the floors upstairs were squeaky, but not a big deal.  The fridge was in an odd location, but we weren't visiting the Monterey Peninsula to sit at home and cook....too many fabulous restaurants to do that! The beds were very comfy and the house had everything we needed.  We enjoyed our stay and would def stay there again."
7292129,102975817,2016-09-19,28663655,Natalie,"The Chestnut Cottage was accurately represented and well worth the nightly rate. The location was great; walking distance to Cannery Row, 17-mile Drive and many other attractions. The cottage was clean and comfortable-plenty of blankets, towels and pillows."
7292129,103652068,2016-09-23,1374208,Anton,"We had a great time at the cottage. The location is nice, walking distance to the ocean and downtown PG. The cottage had everything our family needed, we had a few lovely diners that we cooked ourselves. We had to be careful with the squeaky floors during night time when our son was asleep, but other than that we didn't face any issues. "
7292129,106184892,2016-10-04,27137836,Allison,We had a lovely stay at Chestnut Cottage.  The area is very peaceful and relaxing and the house had lots of charm and character.  It was spacious and had all the amenities you could wish for.  Thank you Kristina.
7292129,120356431,2016-12-09,1443196,Cynthia,"Very quiet and quaint neighbourhood in Pacific Grove, plenty of amenities in walking distance. Cottage was sparkly clean and very well outfitted. The full supply of spices, oils, vinegars, etc. in the pantry was much appreciated. The kitchen is large with plenty of space for cooking. It was a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. "
7292129,122035739,2016-12-20,83494475,Dung,Quiet place in a residential area. Close to the ocean and business.

The house was perfectly clean and very comfortable.  Kristina was very responsive to our questions."
7292129,124784793,2017-01-02,4016729,Asa,"We greatly enjoyed our recent stay in Kristina's place. The communication with her was fantastic.  She was the most responsive of any airbnb host we have worked with.  The house is absolutely as described.  It is extremely cozy and located just across the street from the biggest public park in Pacific Grove. For those families with small children, it was only a few minutes to walk to the playground through the park. A particular issue for us is that I have severe asthma. Kristina made sure that the house was cleaned with non-scented products - and there were no issues with the air quality during my stay.  This was very important for our stay - and we are extremely grateful to Kristina for the time she took to ensure that I would not have an asthma attack in the house.  The only small criticism is that the provisions in the kitchen are quite basic. It is certainly sufficient for preparing light snacks, but would benefit from increased provisions for more advanced cooking.  Overall, we were extremely happy with our visit and will absolutely stay with Kristina again!"
7292129,136921416,2017-03-12,5161663,Noa,"The house is very well located - close to everything you want.
It is as described - big, clean and nicely equipped.

7292129,147047369,2017-04-24,57413613,Alfredo,Centrally located between Monterey/Pacific Grove and Pebble Beach.  Cozy and comfy home in a greet neighborhood.  Bet set up is ideal and kitchen is ideal.
7292129,148865085,2017-05-01,93851396,John,"Photos in the listing represent this delightful home well. Located in a quiet residential area that is convenient to everything in the PG area, much within walking distance. With two couples, we had plenty of room and privacy. Easily found all the utensils that we needed to prepare several meals in the well provisioned kitchen. Kristina was very responsive and the home was clean and ready for us upon arrival. This was a very positive experience that we would not hesitate to repeat if the opportunity arises to return to the area. Could not have found a better place to serve as our home base while in the area for the Big Sur Marathon and touring the area."
7292129,156223258,2017-05-29,14769896,Daniel,"Really nice place, much more spacious then I had initially anticipated."

7292129,177122960,2017-08-01,45679079,Jacquelyn,"Lovely cottage. Well equipped, clean, and comfortable. Kristina provided clear instructions on location and house/neighborhood rules. Most of our activities were in Carmel - the drive was not as quick as it looked on the map. But other area destinations are very close, including the aquarium and good eating and shopping in downtown Pacific Grove."
7292129,180203956,2017-08-09,131773543,Robin,"The place was great!  Comfortable for 6 people - plenty of room and comfy beds and bedding.  Basket of beach goodies was a nice touch.  Peaceful neighborhood, walking distance to downtown.  We would stay here again!"

The neighborhood is very quiet so it feels like you are home! The home is clean with plenty of furnishings, towels, kitchen items and the like. Bathrooms and kitchen are updated and very functional. We loved it and will definitely return!"
7292129,190991460,2017-09-05,85959629,Craig,Had a really great time staying in Monterey. The place was quiet and just what we were expecting. Close to all the things we wanted to do. Quite a time!

7292129,203020242,2017-10-13,35201234,Dawn,Krista was absolutely amazing.  After evacuating from Santa Rosa due to the fires we found ourselves heading south.  Within 10 minutes of contacting Krista she got back to me and worked to accommodate our last minute request.
7292129,204148141,2017-10-16,43206025,Alyssa,Kristina was a great host and was able to accommodate our very last minute reservation. The house is very well appointed and quite charming. We really enjoyed the quiet location and also the decently close proximity to town. We would definitely stay here again if we’re back in town!

7292129,247505459,2018-03-28,37787001,창현,"무척 깔끔하게 정리되어있고, 필요한 물품들이 잘 갖춰져있어서 지내기 좋았습니다. 조용한 주택가에 위치해서 소음 걱정도 없이 잘 지냈네요."
7292129,250960236,2018-04-06,166282909,Jin,"Very nice location with walking distance to everything in Pacific Grove.  Easy 5 min drive to the Acquarium and Cannery Row.  Good amenities and rooms were very nice with queen bed in each.  There are some ants, which means you have to keep exceptionally clean kitchen at all times to keep them from coming in force.  That was a little annoying at times but ultimately the place was a great value and we would go back again."
7327017,45808740,2015-09-06,999100,Masha,"Erlinda was an incredibly kind host and very welcoming. The house is beautiful and in a great location. You can walk to the waterfront in just a few minutes, a couple of minutes in the other direction and you're in the middle of very nice dinning and shopping area of Pacific Grove. It's also right next to one of the entrances to the 17-mile drive and very close to Monterey and Carmel. The house was very clean and there were lots of extra towels, blankets and pillows. There were also the basic provisions in the kitchen, so it was also helpful. There was a slight problem when we came, but Erlinda went out of her way to fix the problem right away, causing us least possible hassle. I highly recommend staying at this house, both the place and the host will make you feel very welcome and at home. And in addition to all the other nice things about the house, there was a washing machine and dryer, cute backyard, and a fire place that we could use. Perfect!"
7327017,47166543,2015-09-16,39549328,Greg,Beautiful home & very gracious host. We throughly enjoyed our stay. 
7327017,49455359,2015-10-04,41659074,Martha,"We loved Erlinda's place--it was just as advertised. The location was wonderful for visiting not only Pacific Grove, but also the entire peninsula. We walked to many of the places we went which was great. The house itself was lovely, well furnished and supplied, and very comfortable (the beds were great!). It was absolutely worth every cent of the cost. Our kids, who frequently use airbnb, said it was very reasonably priced and was one of the nicer places they had stayed. 
Erlinda contacted us directly and arranged to meet us when we arrived and gave us a tour.  She also contacted us during our stay to be sure all was well and thanked us when we left--what a lovely lady! We especially appreciated the kitchen/food and drink supplies and the various books and brochures about the area.
If we ever get back to that area we would absolutely stay there again! Thanks, Erlinda!!!"
7327017,51946397,2015-10-25,45446240,Margaret,"Well, for starters Chuck was there to greet us even thou we were later than our scheduled time with a lovely bottle of wine!  Chuck & Erlinda gave us all kinds of suggestions and information on places to go etc.  Great restaurant tips! Especially enjoyed the free passes to the aquarium, nice touch"
7327017,58609566,2016-01-03,1757550,Chris,"A lovely, cozy home in a great location. Erlinda was a wonderful host, making sure we had everything we needed and reaching out early to let us know exactly what to expect. We look forward to staying here on our next trip to Monterey."
7327017,59983412,2016-01-17,23991930,Renee,We really enjoyed our stay in Pacific Grove! Erlinda's cottage is a short walk from delicious places to eat in the downtown area. The cottage itself was filled with lovely art and very comfortable.
7327017,63234702,2016-02-21,55961754,Emily,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7327017,79454214,2016-06-12,8923736,Monica,"Erlinda was extremely warm and welcoming! Her house was absolutely lovley and comfortable. I really wish we could have stayed longer. If/when we go back to Monterey, I will most definitely be staying here again :). "
7327017,81176423,2016-06-21,180027,G,"The house was really well appointed and in a great location. Erlinda was really easy to communicate with. 
We liked looking at her artwork on the walls and felt really comfortable in the house."
7327017,81754484,2016-06-24,62808028,Taura,Erlinda was very warm and welcoming. The house was close to everything we came to see. You can see the ocean from the porch. The house was very clean and we made use of all amenities. We took a picnic to the beach and used the aquarium passes which let us bypass a long line. Everything we wanted and more. Our daughter also loves cats and so the neighbor cat TigerLily was a bonus. We had a blast! 
7327017,85179529,2016-07-10,9269083,Jaimie,"Erlinda's cottage on Lighthouse Avenue was amazing. As hosts, her and her husband were fantastic, so nice and welcoming. This was the perfect location for us to stay leading up to our wedding. Thank you so much for our opening up your home to us. "
7327017,86022812,2016-07-14,79289537,Tony,The day our stay began we were in communication with Erlinda to coordinate our arrival time.  Her husband was at the property to greet us and give us a quick tour of the home.  The property was exactly as listed.  We were incredibly happy with the home. We have two small children (ages 2 and 4). This property was great for our family.  Both bedrooms are upstairs and adjacent. We used the kitchen for meals - everything you would need was right there. It was a quick walk to the shops and dining in Pacific Grove and a short drive into Monterey.  We would absolutely consider this rental again and recommend to others. It was all very easy and convenient. 
7327017,87115815,2016-07-18,5269326,Maggie,"Erlinda as a host and her home were both flawless.  From very clear communication prior to checkin (even a video showing how to access the home!), to lots of sweet extras and amenities like the Aquarium Pass, bikes with helmets and locks, comfy robes in the closets, etc., and a generous offer for a late checkout (which we unfortunately weren't able to take advantage of) all contributed to an amazing experience of a beautiful place. 

We loved biking to the Aquarium and all over the coastline, and the easy highway access for exploring further south.  Erlinda's impressive book collection highlighting the local area, including cookbooks, literary fiction, and guidebooks, really helped us to immerse ourselves and feel like locals!"
7327017,98172105,2016-08-29,39661497,Matt,"Erlinda's place was perfect for our family. We were looking for something that was walkable to shops and the waterfront, and that is what we found here. The place is very comfortable and has a homey feel. It was really neat to watch the deer walk by from the front porch. The drive to Carmel and Monterey for other destinations is very easy. "
7327017,99962785,2016-09-06,2515718,Kim,"We were welcomed with easy access instructions, a perfect home and bottles of Perrier and Wine, organic popcorn and banana chips!!! 
Love this place. Can't wait to return... Someday"
7327017,104194630,2016-09-25,48703429,Jena,"Erlinda was very helpful and sweet. She was easily reachable throughout our stay when we had questions. Her house was very charming and accommodating. It was also in the perfect location! We loved that there were four bikes for us to use as well, with a gorgeous bike trail along the ocean! "
7327017,105698522,2016-10-02,15583166,Hilary,"I've stayed in several AirBnB's and this was one of the best. Erlinda was very communicative prior to our arrival. The house was very clean and well stocked with everything we needed and then some: including fire wood, snacks and even a bottle of wine. 

You can't beat the location, with lovely restaurants, coffee shops, and the beach a short walk away.

Thanks so much for your hospitality!"
7327017,107560895,2016-10-11,3239213,Ricardo,"Great neighborhood and house.  Easy walking distance to downtown and the beach.  Great communication and easy check in and out.

Need to go back soon!"
7327017,109986071,2016-10-23,17225375,Jordan,"Perfect cozy house for a little getaway weekend with the family.  Location was incredible, the hosts were super welcoming and accommodating, even with welcome snacks.  We will definitely be back."
7327017,131608108,2017-02-12,42615829,Upesh,"Great place in a quite neighborhood that is close to lots of shops, restaurants and most importantly - the ocean! A few blocks from some of the most amazing views in the world. House is very well equipped and very comfortable livable furnishings. Erlinda was great at communicating with us throughout the trip. Many thanks!"
7327017,153671137,2017-05-21,39391242,Brian,"Erlinda's home is wonderful, accommodating and quiet.  Close to everything in Pacific Grove and she even had wine, tickets to the Aquarium and bicycles to ride.  Erlinda was very responsive to any questions and we had a great trip to PG and the Monterey/Carmel area.  Clean, nice guest rooms with comfy beds and clean bathrooms.  Laundry was convenient as was kitchen.  Curbside parking and side entry.  Lovely home away from home, highly recommend."
7327017,159113356,2017-06-09,5879849,Annette,"Comfortable beds, big closets with bathrobes! Kitchen very well equipped. Big living/dining space with lots of chairs in which to lounge. Toys and books for small kids. Check in and check out was simple. Erlinda gave perfect instructions to find her house, where to park and find the key. Wish the weather had been warmer because the table in the small garden would have been a lovely place for morning coffee or afternoon drinks. Really appreciated the passes to the Aquarium."
7327017,161876370,2017-06-18,40505184,Kathryn,We had a great stay. Walking distance to coffee shop and restaurants but still quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Host is very thoughtful and available for questions etc.
7327017,164560420,2017-06-28,3212266,Dorothy (Dodie),"Location and comfort.  We live in the SF Bay area and generally stay in hotels in Pacific Grove or Carmel.  For this trip, we were traveling with 2 grandchildren, ages 7 and 12.   Pacific Grove is the perfect base for exploring the Monterey/Big Sur peninsula:  the town has maintained its seaside-resort, small-town quality.  Erlinda's classic craftsman home is close by the tide-pools and sunsets of Asilomar State beach; an old swimming beach and pool at Lover's Point; a friendly downtown; a straight  shot to the aquarium; easy drive into Carmel, Carmel Valley and Big Sur.  The house has a well-equipped kitchen, comfortable beds, big sitting area, and small private back yard.  Plenty of room for a family or couples traveling together.  Thank you, Erlinda."
7327017,171796790,2017-07-18,139702697,Sindu,"My husband and I had a lovely 2 night stay here with our 9 year old daughter and 13 year old son. The home is quaint, inviting, cozy, comfortable and full of character. There are so many amenities- from a welcome bottle of wine and Pellegrino to popcorn and chips to thoughtful basics in the kitchen to get you started including teas, coffee, sugar, oil, bottled water in fridge, etc. The kitchen is extremely well-equipped and convenient for either heating up food or preparing a full, elaborate, sit down meal. My kids absolutely loved the home too. We all agreed that these were the most amazingly comfortable beds we have slept on away from home! It is conveniently situated close to downtown and the Aquarium is a lovely half hour stroll away along the water. We walked to downtown Monterey on the first day and rented a Surrey on our second morning. It truly was the perfect short getaway. Would recommend it hands down to anyone considering a stay in the area and we hope to be back soon."
7327017,179564219,2017-08-07,120826302,Annie,"The house is very beautiful and clean, just located at the corne of lighthouse and cedar street,very easy to find. It take us 40mins walk from the house to aquasium throgh the Monterey Bay Coastal Trial. The ocean view is excellent!"
7327017,182510101,2017-08-14,51937765,Jo,"What a fantastic place! A beautiful home in a wonderful location. Just the place to explore Monterey and the surrounding beaches. Erlinda was a fantastic host, she went out of her way to be generous and helpful when our daughter was sick and we couldn't checkout on time. Can't recommend highly enough!"
7327017,190221569,2017-09-03,53626162,Kevin,Great place to stay in Monterey. Centrally located for anything you could want to do in the area. Great communication from the host- overall awesome time.
7327017,199370776,2017-10-01,3955481,Isabel,"Erlinda is a most generous and thoughtful host.   We loved her house which has a very convenient location.  We walked a few blocks to buy breakfast in the morning (Fourniers has homemade excellent croissants and pastries), then walked to the beaches and Monterey Bay Aquarium.   We all found the beds extremely comfortable.  Erlinda also ensured there were supplies there just in case we needed snacks and a bottle of wine.   There were bike/locks/helmets.  We will definitely be back for longer next time!   Thank you Erlinda!"
7327017,204566843,2017-10-18,52169070,Jennifer,"Fantastic location and a quaint, charming well-kept home that was very comfortable for our small family of three. Erlinda was a most gracious host who responded quickly to any questions we had prior to arrival. We very much enjoyed our stay."
7327017,227698634,2018-01-15,5927853,Jason,"Cozy, charming home that is walkable to nearby cafes, restaurants, and Lover’s Point. Bikes made it convenient to explore further such as the lighthouse. We appreciated the little things that made it especially enjoyable, such as extra throws by the fireplace and the bedroom; snacks, wine & bottled water on arrival, and books to read about local history. 

Being an older home there are some quirks, such as no direct heating in the bedrooms/bathroom upstairs, but we were fine with the comforter and extra blanket. It was generally quiet on the weekend but weekday morning traffic seemed noticeably busier on Lighthouse Ave. That said, we would definitely consider staying again."
7327017,234175074,2018-02-11,158620869,Lisa,"Erlinda's place is a lovely home, it was great for the 4 of us, very comfortable, charming and located in such a great neighborhood, close to restaurants, shops and cafe's, and easy access to beaches,  Monterey and Carmel."
7462535,43132730,2015-08-17,19632811,Kyle,"This home was perfect for our trip to Monterey. Great location, clean unit and being in a nice neighborhood were just a few positives. Mel and Sal were also great hosts and very welcoming. Would definitely stay hereagain."
7462535,57666376,2015-12-28,4487296,Iyad,"My wife, two adult children and I spent about two weeks at Mel's during the Christmas holiday.  Mel's communications before, during and after the booking process was great - prompt, informative and helpful. Our arrival at PG was delayed by a day because of a major snow storm that closed one of the interstates that we were taking. Mel went above and beyond in accommodating our delay and revising the dates of our stay. The place itself was ideal. Two separate living quarters provided us with privacy when needed, and the common living area provided us with the location to spend family time together. The place itself was very clean and had everything that we needed from sheets and towels to cooking utensils to cleaning supplies. The kitchen was a little small but was more than adequate for our needs. The weather was cold and rainy for most of our stay. Still, I managed to spend time in the garden on a couple of sunny days. I can imagine the garden on warmer days - a beautiful place to sit and have a couple of beers!  Restaurants, waterfront and other tourist attractions were within easy walking distance.

All in all, we had a wonderful stay, Mel was an outstanding host, and the property was perfect for us. Highly recommended."
7462535,58594582,2016-01-03,10800848,Jessie,"Wanted a cozy place to stay in Pacific Grove for New Years with my family (and our beagle!) and couldn't have asked for a better spot! The cottages were clean, warm, and welcoming. The courtyard was a beautiful place to sit out under the hanging lights and let the dog run around. The location was great, a quick walk down to the ocean or shops and restaurants on Lighthouse Ave and a short drive from Monterey, Carmel, and Point Lobos State Park. Mel and Sal were wonderful hosts, responding to any questions we had about the rental quickly and warmly, and even picking up pastries from our favorite local bakery for us since we weren't going to make it there in time! We would love to stay here again!"
7462535,61046110,2016-01-31,1302181,Jason,We enjoyed staying at Mel's place and it was perfect for our needs. She communicated promptly and was there for several questions we had. We'll definitely check Mel's place next time we're in Monterey!
7462535,76010416,2016-05-24,66755805,Neil,"Before, during and after communication was very good. We already knew PG and Monterey pretty well but if we had not Mel's info and instructions would have been super useful and would be pretty much what we would tell folks who were first timers. The double cottage was very cozy and halfway between downtown PG and Canary Row (about a half mile to each). Great location!"
7462535,78152831,2016-06-05,51919734,John,"Great private cottage in perfect Pacific Grove location. Worked out great for my wife and I, and a friend from Santa Barbara. Would highly recommend and will book again in the near future"
7462535,79666591,2016-06-13,7410882,Thomas A,"My family and close friend had a great stay at Mel's cottage and guest house. Our friend joined us for an evening and having the separate unit provided the right amount of privacy. The rental is located in a great, quiet area of Pacific Grove that is a short drive from all of Monterey's attractions, and even not that far of a walk from Cannery Row. I imagine this space would be great for couples traveling together, or families like us that would like to offer our son a separate unit to stay in. Our dog loved chasing the brown squirrels that teased her from the trees that frame the courtyard, and we had fun on the swing. Mel provided just the right amount of communication. We look forward to staying here again!"
7462535,82458879,2016-06-27,3608589,Andrew,"This place was perfect! The location was a quick walk or drive to the waterfront and downtown Monterey or Pacific Grove, and the space was more than enough for our five guests (4 adults, 1 infant). The street parking was super convenient, and we absolutely loved sitting in the swing and sipping wine in the California sun. We'd definitely stay here again!"
7462535,84036620,2016-07-05,67093298,Ashlene,"The cottage and guest house were just as expected! Clean, warm and cozy and perfect for our little weekend getaway! Mel was very easy to work with and very welcoming! Would love the chance to go back!"
7462535,96410516,2016-08-22,3283928,Kathy,"The great thing about staying at Mel’s place in Pacific Grove for a week was that it made the four of us feel a bit like locals. We all love funky, coastal, chic so it was perfect for us and even though we wanted to spend a lot of time with each other it was nice to have the added privacy of separate “cottages” for bedtime.  We enjoyed comfortable beds, nice hot showers with plenty of water pressure and filtered water in the kitchen. Working with Mel was like having your own personal concierge, she was so responsive to all our inquiries and she made the trip easy to plan."
7462535,98428858,2016-08-30,5691824,Greg,"This is one of the cutest and nicest airbnbs we have ever stayed in.  It's in a great quiet neighborhood.  Our kid loved the tree swing.  There's plenty of diversions for the little ones, and a small but workable kitchen that's fully stocked with all the plates and cups and cooking gear etc that you could need.  Really nice relaxing place to spend a couple of days - walking distance to the Aquarium. "
7462535,99687561,2016-09-05,83554204,Jeremy,"Mel did an exceptional job communicating with us through our first Airbnb experience. The cottages were just like being at home incredibly inviting and relaxing, our family truly loved our stay. Mel gave us great insight into the local community making our visit that much better."
7462535,100341800,2016-09-08,6098143,Laura,"This was the perfect place for my family, including a baby and dog, to stay while visiting Monterey and Pacific Grove! The cottage was so charming, we didn't want to leave! Nice fenced in yard with beautiful, majestic palm trees which you can see while eating breakfast. Walk around the corner and you see the ocean. We always had easy street parking right in front of the property and drove less than 5 minutes to reach the beach, restaurants and the Aquarium. Everything was super clean and accommodating in terms of toiletries and linens. Thank you Mel!! "
7462535,102622916,2016-09-18,59565885,Adam,"Mel was a great host and the place was perfect for us. Easy walking distance to the seafront and Cannery Row, good parking, quiet neighbourhood, fantastic space to relax in in the garden, lots of character and the games room and swing made it very child friendly. The four poster bed was so comfortable - very welcome after a long flight. Nothing to fault our stay. Mel was very helpful in hosting us, and even understood our English panic when we thought we couldn't make a cup of tea (didn't realise the coffee maker also did hot water!). The Aquarium tickets were an added bonus and really appreciated. "
7462535,103291503,2016-09-21,26622859,Deborah,"We have wanted to visit the Monterey area for a long time with our dog but it isn't easy to find a place to stay that will allow a bigger dog. I chose Mel's cottage because she allows a dog. The set up was even better than expected!! The courtyard was perfect to keep our pup safe and allow her a little freedom. We also loved being able to walk to EVERYTHING. Great restaurants, grocery store and Cannery Row! Great location! "
7462535,105389326,2016-10-01,1382940,Sarah,What a great holiday! Absolutely perfect if you're traveling with another couple or older kids - the two separate cottages offer ample privacy while still giving you the proximity you need. Mel was extremely responsive and very helpful with an organized PDF containing all the information you could possibly need including recommendations for restaurants in the area. Overall a fantastic stay.
7462535,106168271,2016-10-04,25722314,Abby,"Mel's place is amazing! Such a perfect spot for our trip to Monterey. My friend and I went for a kayaking and sea otter watching long weekend adventure, and we absolutely loved staying in Pacific Grove at Mel's. Super clean, super nice, GREAT location close to everything, very comfy beds, perfect kitchen for our purposes, and tons of amenities. We particularly loved winding down at night with a glass of wine in the courtyard!  Mel was a lovely and gracious host who checked on us more than once to make sure all was okay, but was not at all intrusive. I would absolutely stay here again and definitely would recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely home base from which to explore the coast. Thanks for everything, Mel - it was fantastic! 
"
7462535,107318666,2016-10-10,85175241,David,Mel was great and the place was perfect!
7462535,108093027,2016-10-14,90837644,Carolyn,This was the perfect place for our short vacation with our four legged family members.  Mel was so helpful from start to finish.  She has such an upbeat personality and was easy to share with.  The courtyard is perfect; loved the fire pit on the cool evenings.  Thanks so much!
7462535,131782672,2017-02-13,14413830,Justin,"We stayed at Mel's place while working the AT&T Pro-Am event. It was convenient and cozy. The space is a little smaller than anticipated, but it was still a great place for us. It has a lovely outdoor area to relax. Mel was a fantastic host and we would stay there again."
7462535,133159690,2017-02-20,4753687,Anna,"Mel's place is the perfect weekend getaway. Its location, size, and amenities make it flexible for eating in or out, walking down to the water, and taking a quick drive to Carmel. It's comfortable, quiet, and private.  I highly recommend it!"
7462535,140947939,2017-04-01,56223225,Jennifer,Perfect set up for two couples or teen kids!
7462535,147785524,2017-04-28,1464600,Mary,"Mel's place was an incredible find in Pacific Grove, for less than most of the hotels we looked into. We were there for a 10 day trip with an infant, so wanted a place that we could cook some meals instead of having to run out every morning for breakfast or be out late every night for dinner. Mel's little kitchen was very well-equipped and just what we needed. And the bedroom and living room were cozy and relaxing. When we arrived, the cottages were sparkling clean (literally…the bathroom floors sparkled), and Mel even went to the trouble of finding a pack-n-play for our son! She was in regular communication with us both before our trip and during our stay, making sure we had everything we needed. When we reported a couple minor issues (mainly for her FYI, not because we weren't satisfied), she was very gracious. On top of that, she provided free aquarium passes (a huge money saver)! The little cottages were truly a unique find, as was the host!"
7462535,149353038,2017-05-03,2365178,Jful,"Nicely updated long-standing cottages less than a mile from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row shops. The two guest passes for use at the aquarium really were great! The cottages were well supplied with all one could imagine to need. Mel provided excellent communication to assure our check-in/out went smoothly. We especially enjoyed the food at a nearby restaurant, International Cuisine (on the 600 block of Lighthouse Ave). Asilomar State Beach was only minutes away and we spent time there each evening watching the sea otters frolicking in the surf as the sun set over the Pacific Ocean. "
7462535,152031814,2017-05-14,90786544,Lindsay,"My fiance and I came with some friends for a mutual 30th birthday celebration to see some races at Laguna Seca. I am local to the area but have been living in Seattle for a few years now so it was really nice to be back in town enjoying a lot of things that I didn't take advantage of when I lived here. The location is perfect to do everything touristy, the house was well stocked to allow us to relax after a long day, and the outside area was amazing!! All in all I highly recommend staying at Mel's place when you're in town!!"
7462535,152821520,2017-05-18,6591637,Shelah,"We had a fabulous stay!  Mel is open and quick with communication.  The location is terrific, the neighborhood is quiet, and the cottages are clean & absolutely comfortable.
Having two small private places to stay with the courtyard in between is so perfect for the 4 of us (plus 1 doggie) on this trip that we are seriously considering repeating this vacay annually!"
7462535,156239899,2017-05-29,61979568,Amanda,Super cute cottages walking distance to Cannery row on a quiet street. Plenty of fun games to help unwind. Mel was also awesome at communicating rules and how to get in.
7462535,166886283,2017-07-04,31290524,Brittany,"What a fantastic find in the heart of Pacific Grove/Monterey! The neighborhood is lovely and so close to Monterey's sites like the Aquarium, Cannery Row, the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail, the 17 Mile Drive, and Lover's Point Park and Beach.  The Airbnb itself is super cute with a great shared courtyard and yard with BBQ, firepit and outdoor seating.  The two cabins are super cute and was perfect for us two couples (and dogs) traveling together.  It's also a great value in a destination where good values can be hard to find.  We really enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend it!"
7462535,168618591,2017-07-09,34522013,Jenny,Such a gem of an airbnb! We loved our stay here so much. The outdoor space is perfect and the cottages are so cozy and comfortable! Mel was a wonderful host as well :) would definitely recommend a stay here! 
7462535,178124256,2017-08-04,130930429,Debbie,We love older houses and both of the houses on the lot were comfortable and well maintained.  My husband and I traveled with our son and his wife and child; the larger house was a natural place to congregate but we also were able to have the privacy of 2 houses.  We loved Pacific Grove and did a lot of walking around the area.  Mel was easy to reach and even gave us historical facts on the houses!
7462535,188821229,2017-08-30,86394821,Xiaohang,The room is clean and any problems will be answered promptly
7462535,190755009,2017-09-04,34600193,Cord,"Our stay at Mel's place was a pure delight! The cottages are lovely, very comfortable, and well equipped. The courtyard was perfect for our three year old to play in and run between the two cottages. The neighborhood is pretty and quiet. It's a short walk or an extremely short drive to Cannery Row and all its amenities.

We highly recommend staying at Mel's."
7462535,191791933,2017-09-08,121026837,Amy,Would definitely recommend this unit for any family or small group. Absolutely loved these cottages. This place is a place that is perfectly located and in such a peaceful quiet neighborhood. Neighbors were friendly and we didn't have any issues at all parking right by our unit. There was always room for 2 cars. Had an amazing time here!
7462535,196037303,2017-09-21,7099671,Jonathan,"If you are looking for a great location to everything the Monterey Peninsula has to offer, look no further.  We went everywhere from Fisherman's wharf, to Carmel Beach with a quick drive.  You can walk to the water, however, there is a big hill to walk back up when you return.  
The Cottages were perfect for 2 couples.  The kitchen was stocked with enough dishes/appliances/pots and pans to make fresh baked fish, light lunches, and breakfast daily.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals in the courtyard. Speaking of the outdoor space, we just couldn't get enough of it.  We loved having our own wine and cheese happy hours around the fire pit before heading out for dinner most evenings.  The beds were very comfortable in both houses.  Added perks-2 passes to Monterey Aquarium and games galore.  We made memories to last a lifetime at this place.  
Mel was extremely helpful and quick to respond.  We would love to stay here again."
7462535,197759847,2017-09-26,857894,Melanie,Perfect and clean! Close walk to beach. Nice yard. I highly recommend.
7462535,200518749,2017-10-05,82930780,Todd,"These cottages were adorable and affordable. Nice to have some alone space when traveling with others and then have a common area where everyone can get together, play games and hang out. Lovely area, great host and magnificent cottages in Pacific Grove."
7462535,201689272,2017-10-08,19710108,Joann,"We had a terrific stay in Pacific Grove.   Thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful walkable cities of Monterey and Pacific Grove.  The house(s) worked out perfectly for 2 couples and dogs.  Comfortable and everything was as described.   Most appreciated was our hostess, Mel, checking in and making certain all was good - at check in and out.   Though we didn't need anything, it was really nice knowing we could get in touch easily.    Thanks for a wonderful weekend!!!!"
7462535,203287362,2017-10-14,151720800,Kristin,"The two cottages are perfect for four people, and the location is great. It is an easy walk to the beach and other popular attractions in the area. The cottages were very clean when we arrived, and convenience items such as soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, etc. were provided. Mel was easy to communicate with and answered any questions we had. The aquarium passes were a nice surprise! Would definitely recommend!"
7462535,213551219,2017-11-21,30501154,Betsy,"These two cottages allow for families with adult children to share a vacation while having their own space - a perfect homey space to experience beautiful Pacific scenery in a relaxed environment.  Great attention to detail, very comfortable."
7462535,214835789,2017-11-26,135139452,Paul,"This was the perfect getaway. Host was very responsive and helpful. Wonderful location, very short walk to the beach and the aquarium/Cannery Row. It was clean, rooms and amenities were well thought out. Loved the fire pit. Would highly recommend if you're looking to spend some time in the Monterey/Pacific Grove area."
7462535,219542691,2017-12-17,21336661,Leslie,This place was awesome.  I would recommend to anyone traveling with a group.
7462535,220765114,2017-12-23,11162672,Kathy,"Mel’s place was delightful and was perfect for our family. The main house is clean and cozy, the dogs loved the secure yard and the guest house was perfect for our daughter and her husband. It was an easy walk to the aquarium.  I highly recommend Mel’s place and would stay there again!!!

7462535,221515392,2017-12-26,133913176,Nicole,Location was very close to both Lovers point and Cannery Row. We walked to get coffee every morning and to walk the beach. Enjoyed our stay in quaint Pacific Grove.
7462535,225227590,2018-01-05,7482928,David,We had a marvelous time at Mel's cottages. Check-in was a snap and communication was excellent. The cottages were perfect for our family of four and our two dogs loved the open patio. The location to the Aquarium is within easy walking distance and Carmel is a short drive away. Would definitely stay again!
7462535,226090352,2018-01-08,12588635,Holly,"Perfect place to stay! Great location walking distance to the Aquarium and Cannery Row (uphill on the way back--perfect for toning those legs, but maybe not so great if you're like, toting 4 bags of groceries and a baby). The kitchen is nice and functional and had everything I needed to make a couple of meals. My 5 year old loved the swing in the backyard, and I loved the half-door so I could keep an eye on him while he was outside. The two cottages are perfect for a family with different bedtimes. My son and I wanted to go to bed early, so we stayed in the main cottage and shared a bed, and my husband wanted to stay up later to do work so he stayed in the other cottage. So many pillows on the bed--I love when there are tons of pillows. Super cute property, I really enjoyed how unique it all was, in an adorable neighborhood. "
7462535,228644107,2018-01-20,154866229,Andrew,"We had a fantastic time! Mel was a wonderful host, she contacted us a few times throughout the week to make sure we were all set. The cottages were beautiful. We loved the outdoor living space and used it quite a bit. Our teenage boys loved the ability to walk right down and enjoy the aquarium and Cannery Row, the Aquarium and Pacific Grove's little village. We hope to be able to stay here again someday soon!"
7462535,230248176,2018-01-27,16749587,Gerard,"Quiet, secluded space with opportunities to hang out in style outside.  It was a perfect for us and our puppy, who loved the time running around the yard.  Centrally located, which made it easy to move from Asilomar to Cannery Row and downtown Monterey. Highly recommended."
7462535,231996676,2018-02-03,67613544,Frances,"Mel's two cottages are perfectly located to make you feel like a ""local"" in lovely Pacific Grove.  Tucked into a nice neighborhood, the location is still within walking distance of Lovers' Point and the charming downtown as well as the Aquarium.  The kitchen had everything needed.  The bathroom was spotless and the king size bed in main cottage (with just two of us plus our Golden Retriever we only used one cottage) was so comfortable.  We loved our week spent at Mel's.  "
7462535,234165876,2018-02-11,70992747,Lori,We loved the cottages!  So much to see and do with the kids within walking distance!  We will def be coming back next year!
7462535,236235152,2018-02-18,6543353,Matthew,"Fantastic space.  The outdoor space was larger than I'd expected, and the setup was perfect for two couples traveling together - there was space to hang out together, but also private space.  The location is fantastic, we walked to almost everything."
7622828,42959823,2015-08-16,16382192,Ali,"Incredible house, incredible setting and an incredible host. There's really nothing more one could be looking for beyond what my  group and I experienced. Every  room was spacious and came with their own unique characteristics including the furniture and decor. The huge master bedroom for one has breathtaking views of the majestic Pacific Ocean and surrounding landscape.  We also found ourselves spending lot of time in the large backyard lounging around on the comfortable outdoor furniture and enjoying the view during the day and star gazing at night with the sound of ocean waves in the background.  All the other less-important stuff like modern amenities, cookware, electronics etc are top notch as to be expected from a luxurious, up-scale home.  To top it off, Ash was a great guide whenever we needed a  guidance on a restaurant or local event.  In fact, chances are he is friends with the person running it.  It's easy to see why - given our good fortune meeting him in person at a roof-top bar he recommended in Carmel.  5 Stars !!!"
7622828,43427107,2015-08-19,30024589,Brian,"My family just had a fantastic stay at this house. We enjoyed watching movies in the theatre room. The kitchen had all the appliances, utensils, and kitchenware we needed. The patio in the back was a pleasant surprise, with enough seating for ~8 adults. The neighborhood exceeded our expectations with it being so quiet and literally one block away from the walking path along the coastline. It was just a few min drive to downtown Pacific Grove, where we found an excellent Mediterranean restaurant. Also, ~5 mins to the start of the 17-mile drive. Ash was super responsive and accommodating. We didn't need to meet up with him in person, but we definitely felt taken care of.  "
7622828,46735179,2015-09-13,674498,Ty,"Ash's house is amazing, with all the amenities you could possibly need and such an amazing view from the master bedroom. The house was clean, and made for a great chill spot to hang with my friends. We will definitely be coming back!"
7622828,48324576,2015-09-25,29885196,Clark,This home was amazing and truly exceeded our expectations! 
7622828,48629414,2015-09-27,24906214,Dennis,My family had an amazing time at Ash's beautiful home! So easy to communicate with and full listed details on all amenities!  With the Ocean at the back door we were all in awe with such a beautiful landscape. I highly recommend this House for anyone planning to visit Monterey Bay / Pacific Grove area! We'll be back! Thanks again Ash!!
7622828,51162580,2015-10-18,35393530,Kenny,Home was clean & in great condition.  It was in a great location close to the coast & golf courses.  Ash was very responsive and easy to reach.  I would definitely stay there again!
7622828,51924443,2015-10-25,44353622,Kristen,"Great location, beautiful house.  This was the perfect place to celebrate a milestone birthday with family.  The kitchen was great for group cooking and the theater room was fantastic for hanging out and looking at photos on the big screen.  The deck and patio were also very enjoyable."
7622828,54373886,2015-11-19,639943,Shari,"Very large, pleasant home one block from the ocean in a cute neighborhood.  Clean, comfortable with a nice open kitchen, fireplace and large deck to enjoy the California sunshine.  Ash the owner was quick with communication and provided easy instructions on check in and check out.  He also had suggestions when we were looking for a venue to host a small reception."
7622828,55213335,2015-11-29,46300191,Roxanne,"Wifi reliable, easy access to the walking path along the beach. Lots of room in the media room and appreciated the option to use the Wii program."
7622828,57294509,2015-12-24,85937,Alberta,Ash was great! Beautiful home & exactly as described! 
7622828,62930765,2016-02-18,3017560,Myrna,"What a beautiful home and in such a wonderful location! We loved the decor. Very welcoming and color scheme was beautiful. Many provisions in the home such as w&d, dw, great cooking space, cozy entertainment area and wonderful deck. It was so easy to get to the beach from this location. And the house is located in a very nice neighborhood.  We walked everywhere! And Ash was welcoming & easy to reach! "
7622828,63169052,2016-02-21,17880950,Scott,"Ash was an amazing host- from the first call he welcomed us into the amazing house. It is a wonderful house, feet away from the beautiful coastline, 2 blocks from the public golf course, 1 mile from the Asilomar conference center.

The house outshines it's pictures online- very clean and modern- great kitchen- awesome backyard, ocean views off the deck, amazing master bedroom. Fit our group perfectly- best house I've rented so far from air BnB "
7622828,68502249,2016-04-05,17760067,Barnali,"This house worked well for our weekend get away for 5 adults and 2 children.  The house was modern, clean, spacious, and a short walk from the beach.  

Our host, Ash, was very responsive via email, and easy to work with.

This place was great, though a bit pricey.  "
7622828,73720714,2016-05-09,66496918,Helen,We did feel welcome but thought this was not our idea of luxury.  Walking into the home was not bright and cheery as the picture portrayed.  There are two ugly sofas to the left of the entrance and a fireplace that is no longer usable.  The kitchen had nice appliances but the dishwasher was broken.  We did ask and they had a maid come in one day to do dishes but we had to do them the second day.  The downstairs bathrooms were very small and dark...1 1/2 bathrooms for 3 bedrooms.  One of those bedrooms had no closet or chest of drawers.. so our son and daughter and law could not unpack.  I'd give it a C+ for luxury. Location was good except for looking at house in front which blocked view of the ocean and had plastic markers all over it for a future remodel.
7622828,79412275,2016-06-12,66762433,Nasha,"Happy Ash was an amazing host. On the day we were arriving I asked him where I could purchase a pack n play for our baby and he went and sourced one for us. He answered all questions quickly and was super helpful. The property was beautiful. Bright, clean and spacious. Quick walk to the ocean. Would definitely return for a weekend getaway."
7622828,81743090,2016-06-24,33150442,Steve,"House was as advertised, owner was very helpful and quick to respond with any questions.  Kitchen is beautiful - a great place to stay if you plan on cooking!"
7622828,82071376,2016-06-26,1604735,Carolyn,"I stayed at this property this past weekend and it was such a positive experience I would highly recommend this place and host to anyone. 

Host: I have been in constant communication with the host prior to my stay and he has always responded within an hour (or even within a minute of sending my message!). He was very helpful, easygoing, and friendly to communicate with.

Location: Super convenient! Walking distance to the ocean, 20 minutes driving from Monterey airport, 10 minutes driving from Cannery Row and the Aquarium, about an hour away driving from Big Sur

Property: Partial oceanview, Alot of natural light (of course, depending on the weather), Gorgeous interior, Very clean, Nice patio/deck to lounge outside if it's not too breezy, very spacious, Master bedroom has a balcony with a better view of the ocean, Was exactly as described in the pictures if not better!

All in all, this was the perfect property for our stay :)"
7622828,85153075,2016-07-10,66445981,Quynh,"My family and I love the house not only of its location closing to the beach with beautiful view, but also with the artistic decor .  Every corner in and outside of the house is so beautiful and clean.  "
7622828,85809298,2016-07-13,77017614,Timothy,The house was beautiful and clean.  Location was perfect.  Host was friendly and easy to communicate with.  I would absolutely stay here again.
7622828,86764574,2016-07-17,8624768,Max,The experience at Happy's beautiful home was fantastic. Everything is as pictured in the photos. We really enjoyed the large open kitchen and dining area. Would highly recommend staying here!

Thank you Happy!:)"
7622828,90567425,2016-08-01,7097812,Michael,"This was terrific place to stay in Monterey/Carmel area for a  family group of six. The location is ideal-quiet neighborhood, a block from ocean, nice views of water, especially upstairs, easy drive to Aquarium, Carmel and other sights. House is large, especially master bedroom/bath on second floor, and the kitchen and television room are  very functional and comfortable. Kitchen very well supplied, plus outside barbecue. Host extremely accessible and helpful."
7622828,98208165,2016-08-29,18471691,Thoa,Great house in pacific grove with sea views from the back yard. Spacious house! We enjoyed staying there and host was nice and extremely responsive. 
7622828,99735924,2016-09-05,23006202,Sharon,This home is located close to the shore of Monterey Bay/Pacific Ocean and presently has a view of the water.   It has a spacious master bedroom and bath and three other bedroom that are good-size.   The fifth bedroom is quite small with a twin-sized  couch/bed in it that takes up most of the room.  It has a large TV room with cable and Apple TV.     The host communicates well and welcomes questions.
7622828,102622550,2016-09-18,1852667,Neha,"Happy was very prompt at responding to our inquiries even though he was traveling. The place was exactly as shown in the pics, the kitchen was super well stocked with spices, toaster, dishes, silverware etc. We had a great time."
7622828,104642733,2016-09-27,91756381,Clement,"Great experience staying at the Pacific Grove property by the host. Beautiful house in a great location, quiet neighbourhood, and walking distance to Sunset drive."
7622828,107823699,2016-10-12,57211944,Tom,"Very nice stay, just as advertised. Happy was very responsive with a couple of questions. I'd recommend and return."
7622828,111300269,2016-10-30,92600817,Davood,Very nice place and we would love to come back. 
7622828,122911916,2016-12-26,93965797,Laila,This place was absolutely lovely! I comfortably stayed here for Christmas weekend with the family and enjoyed the spacious yet cozy home! The location was perfect--nearby the ocean and the popular attractions like 17 mile drive and the Monterey bay aquarium! I would definitely come back here again. 
7622828,123798143,2016-12-30,1417341,David,"Great place, amazing location and very clean.  Close to coast, restaurants, golf courses, etc.  Highly recommended."
7622828,124397471,2017-01-01,7167608,Cassie,Ash was extremely responsive and ready to answer any questions we had about our stay. The house was beautiful and perfect location for walking on the beach and exploring Pacific Grove. The outdoor patio is great to grill on and spend evenings watching the ocean. The bedrooms and bathrooms are located great so that all the guests had enough privacy and space.  Lots of little fish markets nearby for cooking local seafood. :) The oysters from Sea Harvest market were delicious! House is great proximity to Monterey Aquarium and Cannery Row. Neighborhood is very respectful and quiet. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in Pacific Grove! 
7622828,135702648,2017-03-05,13795332,Dana,The place looks just like the pictures. Couple things to note: the one bedroom and bathroom upstairs is significantly better than the others and it's also much quieter. My friends who stayed downstairs said the walls were quite thin. Overall really awesome place -- wish it was warmer outside so we could have used the great backyard area!
7622828,137496935,2017-03-15,31148486,Robin,"Lovely house and very close to water, trail and beauty! "
7622828,138670892,2017-03-20,117550876,Bob,"We were celebrating a couple family birthdays and wanted to walk along the ocean, bike ride and enjoy the restaurants in Carmel and Monterey. This home is perfectly located between both in a beautiful neighborhood just a block from the Pacific. Had a wonderful time!"
7622828,141772880,2017-04-04,776612,Alex,"Excellent location for Monterey, Carmel, Pebble Beach and the 17 mile drive "
7622828,144830961,2017-04-16,12588430,Mike,A beautiful house with every ammenity. My family and I were very happy and comfortable. I would definitely come again!
7622828,148374383,2017-04-30,2960295,Maureen,"We had a family reunion with my hubby, 4 adult kids, daughter in law, son in-law & 2 young grandkids. The house has plenty of space, and we were comfortable! The location is a block from the ocean-great to walk down there and soak in the beauty! The weather was lovely so taking the kids walking and playing by the ocean was such fun. We even saw whales! The house is not toddler proof but w a watchful eye doable. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. We did yoga on the back porch w a great view and had a big fun family dinner one night in the kitchen area. Movie night in the lounge room another night. They have a reg coffee pot as well as Keurig. (Bring your own coffees and teas bc they have just a little)   We had to go buy olive oil, butter etc to cook with-some other Airbnbs stock those. I don't think anyone lives here full time so it's not filled w a bunch of daily dailies per se. Good part of that is that you don't feel intrusive. The master bedroom upstairs is the best room in the place! Weren't as many towels or little amenities as we are used to but we didn't contact the host either to inquire. We had no problem checking in or out. Overall a thumbs up! "
7622828,150329590,2017-05-07,95138764,Dave,"Veterans Charity Ride, a non-profit veterans program needed a place in Monterey for a veterans weekend retreat. This house and location was absolutely perfect! Happy the owner really made our stay a great one. The house is very upscale with all the amenities and furnishings needed. You can watch the whales swim by from the backyard!!"
7622828,151054842,2017-05-10,3959777,Michael,Nkce place to stay for a small group of golfers.
7622828,151636195,2017-05-13,11169408,Parsha,This house is excellent. Closer to the water then it appears in photos.

7622828,157759988,2017-06-04,10449197,Courtney,This house was perfect for a small group stay! Plenty of space and amenities were exactly as described. Would definitely recommend and stay there again. 
7622828,159846609,2017-06-11,28357453,Neil,Happy was easy to work with and made our getaway weekend a success.  The house is perfect for a big group and the deck is an absolute delight when the weather is nice.  We played cards on the big dining room table and had a wonderful time.  
7622828,166867826,2017-07-04,5952655,Eric,Happy is very respectful and a great communicator. Property is as described and 2 minute walk to the ocean. Highly recommend property and host. Thanks Happy!
7622828,173719032,2017-07-23,657541,Kathy,This was a great stay. We had a wonderful time and Happy's home is in a great location! We had a girls' wellness weekend and couldn't have imagined a better stay.
7622828,179119240,2017-08-06,93225156,Stephanie,"Wonderful home, wonderful host and wonderful location!"
7622828,180586452,2017-08-10,137730396,Bruce,"We had a very nice stay at Happy's house which is a very short walk from the shore.  Happy was quite easy to work with and we had no issues at all.  The house is quite attractively laid out, there's plenty of room and the beds were quite comfortable.  It's just a few finishing touches away from a 5-star rating (for instance, an upstairs sink faucet that turns but does nothing, unfinished steps and a sharp drop off from the back deck, lack of room darkening window coverings in the master bedroom, mirrors leaning against walls instead of being rehung (after a recent inside painting?)).  In any case it was more than fine for the three of us staying there and it would have been comfortable for many more guests."
7622828,182088536,2017-08-13,30174248,Simona,Beautiful home with gorgeous views!   Highly recommended!
7622828,191195519,2017-09-06,101984841,Rory,"Excellent house with lots of indoor space, a brilliant cinema / music room and a super decking and BBQ area. Lots to do and see in Pacific Grove, Monterey and Carmel. 
A few minor hiccups; light bulbs missing, not quite enough crockery for the eight of us, a few extra towel rails and hanging space would be welcome. Also there was only one shower downstairs for six people.
We enjoyed super weather and the memory of watching whales from our deck while sipping delightful Californian wine will live long."
7622828,197149270,2017-09-24,23127789,Scott,"Great home! Absolutely perfect location for our family gathering. Just steps from the beach, beautiful view from the upstairs master, great back deck, and plenty of space for a large group. Our host was easy to communicate with and we had a wonderful time. Definitely would recommend it, should you find yourself in the area!"
7622828,201655759,2017-10-08,61483737,Merav,Beautiful house at a stunning location
7622828,202332039,2017-10-10,50534772,Josh,"Unfortunately this property did not live up to the listing - Happy was great to deal with but the property itself was a let down.  We were a group of 9 and thought we were booking a 5 bedroom property but we found out on arrival there were only 5 bedrooms plus a pull out couch with no linen on it.  The laundry was full of dirty linen in both the washing machine and dryer, the kitchen was not clean enough and the deck area of the house was not clean enough to sit on.  The BBQ was absolutely filthy and was so rusted we were too scared to use it.  The gardens look like no-one has tended to them forever.  Overall not worth what we paid for it."
7622828,213540917,2017-11-21,152839455,Paul,Only about 50 steps to the beach. Well kept and clean. Worked great for our family gathering.
7622828,214876529,2017-11-26,5543095,Marie,"Beautiful house, very comfortable and well located."
7622828,221513181,2017-12-26,8270475,Jill,"The 5th bedroom is not a comfortable bed, and would not accommodate 2 people for sleeping. 
Lacking amenities for the price. 4 bedrooms on main floor must share 1 and 1/2 Bath. Kitchen is lacking in utensils, dishes, and no extra paper products as was stated. 
Wonderful location, and the master bedroom is nice."
7622828,224308572,2018-01-02,53975086,Kimberly A.,Beautiful views in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of space for a big group!
7622828,227709594,2018-01-15,14073272,Beth,"To corroborate or refute other reviews I saw... the fifth room is really small and has a bed only a bit larger than a twin. It would be okay for one adult or two kids but not any more than that. Also the house had lots of towels, sheets, and blankets. I saw a review saying there weren't enough towels so I brought extra and that was not necessary. The kitchen had lots of staples like oil, spices, etc. There is a separate family room and living room which was perfect for our group with kids - the kids could watch tv in the separate family room and the adults got some quiet time. The four bedrooms on the first floor share 1 full and 1 half bath but our large group didn't find it challenging. The location is amazing! You can see the ocean from both floors and beach is about 100 yard walk away. Great spot for sunset walks along the water or morning runs to Lover's Point - we did both!"
7622828,232675294,2018-02-05,37081116,Panteha,"Beautiful home, perfect for large groups of friends or family.  We had 9 people here for the Super Bowl (8 couples + 1), BBQ'd, cooked, and watched the game on a large flat-screen in a comfortable TV room.  One block from the shore and a running trail along the beach.  Everyone was comfortable and had a great time -- we may even return for our next friends' outing.  

Happy is incredibly responsive and accommodating.  No confusion or missteps along the way.  Very relaxing weekend."
7622828,245088695,2018-03-20,19232046,Bryan,Very relaxing getaway for our Family .
7622828,246574126,2018-03-25,1218753,Jeannie,"Happy's place is great and is located right on the water. In the morning, we took a nice walk along the water, which was very scenic. Check in was easy, and the rooms were all nicely furnished. The pictures were very accurate. The kitchen had high end appliances and was well stocked. It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway with a group of friends."
7622828,250968676,2018-04-06,148998814,Kip,"Happy’s place has an incredible, beautiful location. So close to Pacific Grove town, Monterey, and just so close to the shoreline you can crack your window and hear the waves crashing. 

For us, the general upkeep of the home needed attention. I feel like Happy can easily fix a small list I have given him and make improvements. I feel like sharing specific things on this review is unfair to him because they are small and I don’t want to give him an unfair review that would dissuade others from checking out the house. The location and large size of the home make it worth the look if that’s what you’re into."
7689901,49944247,2015-10-07,1132882,S,"Our stay at this ocean front property for our wedding anniversary was idyllic!! It was all we had anticipated and more. Our hosts were helpful, courteous, generous, and very personable.  We were greeted with a ""Happy Anniversary"" card and a bottle of champagne, which we promptly enjoyed on the patio sitting around the fire pit listening to the lulling sounds of the bay just steps away.

The property is beautifully decorated and maintained. It's roomy with views of the bay through the French doors that open onto the patio. The kitchen and bathroom were immaculate and well equipped. 

The location is ideal. Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row are a short and lovely walk from the property, yet far enough away to avoid the crowds. In the opposite direction is the ocean shore, with its rocky coast and crashing waves. Several great restaurants are also within walking distance...even a movie theater showing first-run movies.

For anyone who loves sea life and wants to relax in the most comfortable surroundings, this place is for you. The only drawback for us is that we had to check-out!!"
7689901,51629462,2015-10-22,35158003,Dennis,"We had an amazing time here. Great house, great neighborhood. Kelly  made us feel very welcome. I would recommend this location to anyone traveling to Monterey. "
7689901,55015799,2015-11-27,40471232,Liping,"The house was great. We called William Hemmer to assist us for taking us a look at the house. The house was small but warm. We faced a bad weather during the day, and as we arrived I was surprised that this place has a heater that warm up quickly. The fire place in the house did not help that much but it adds a lot of atmosphere to our dinner during the night. For the fire pit outside, during cold weather it is really just a decoration than an actual practical fire pit. The fire was too small for us to go outside during the cold to keep warm and look at the moon. 
The location of this house I have to say it is brilliant. Right beside the ocean, the Ocean Front house gave you a great view during the sunrise and sunset. It is also near a shopping mall by walking distance if you wanted to go there. The house have all the silverware and china you need to cook your own food. The light however went out during our stay in one of the rooms, but William did came over to fix it quickly. Thumb up to the service!

Unfortunately we didn't got the chance to say hello to the host. 

I personally think this is a great house and worth the price to stay at all times. If you are thinking about getting it, please don't hesitate as it is the right choice to make. "
7689901,59225120,2016-01-08,7351661,Mou,Had a wonderful time staying at this lovely property right on the water! The kitchen was gorgeous and really nice to cook in. The fire pit outside was great for chilly mornings and evenings. The house is located centrally and is a 5 minute walk from the Monterey Bay Aquarium! This was a great place for a family vacation!
7689901,59574878,2016-01-12,49664444,Rita,Our long weekend in the Monterey area was awesome. The condo was everything we expected and some. There was not any thing we wanted extra. The ability to walk every where was so nice. Couldn't of asked for a better location. 
7689901,61051318,2016-01-31,42337305,Wiley,"From the moment we got there we loved the place. It's obvious the view from the house is what sells the place. The bonus is the walkability. You can easily walk to Cannery Row, Lovers Point, Downtown PG within minutes. The best spot at the house is the outside patio with the gas/lava rock fire pit! Super warm and we even sat outside when it rained and it kept us dry. Friends and Family had coffee and adult beverages there every morning and night during our stay. If you enjoy people watching, this will be your haven with all the folks and animals walking by on the trail. Plenty of wildlife, we saw whales, otters, seals, and many different types of seabirds. Bonus is the house offers two guest passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Has all the amenities you need to do all your own cooking. Has two at least king size beds (one in each room) which could easily fit three adults if needed. The inflatable mattress had the best view in the house when we set it up in the living room in front of the main door which overlooked the ocean and next to the indoor gas fireplace. The price was right for the location, you just can't beat it. We will definitely coming back in the future!"
7689901,64528786,2016-03-05,5833122,Dunyelle,"Great place, beautiful views, and very comfortable accommodations.  We will be back for sure!!"
7689901,64967698,2016-03-09,60421088,Bethany,"Our stay here was an out-of-this-world experience for our family. Booking online is a little tense, but when we arrived we knew we had chosen perfectly! The view out the front was over-the-top gorgeous with seals, rock formations, and crashing waves. It was easy to walk to the aquarium (a must see) and we were thrilled to receive two free passes. The entire family loved the two nights we stayed here more than the other nights of our Cali vacation, and that's saying a lot because we were in Muir Woods during the other part of our stay! The home is immaculate, gorgeously restored, and every attention to detail made us feel very pampered. Everything -- from the wine glasses and dinnerware to the heated floor in the bath and super-comfy mattresses -- shows that the owners take their roles as hosts very seriously. We cooked dinner in the kitchen both nights by choice -- we wanted to be in the home every minute we could and a great little grocery is right around the corner.  We will forever remember our time around the awesome fire pit (now we want one, too!). I was nervous about staying in a ""duplex"" since we have children and we can be pretty picky about noise and intrusion while on vacay. But this worked out fantastically! The hosts are super friendly and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. We absolutely loved it and will recommend this to all of our friends. The only mistake we made was not booking an entire week because we really didn't want to leave. Book without hesitation!!! We can't wait to come back."
7689901,65152363,2016-03-11,54516332,Gin,"Kelly and Bill greeted us upon our arrival, showed us around the space, and were easy to get in touch with when/if needed. The space was a little smaller than I thought it would be but for the 3 of us it was fine. I think it would be a little tight for 6 people. I liked the size of the bedrooms and the bathrooms were nice. We enjoyed the neighborhood with the walking path right out front, amazing views of the ocean, and easy walks to restaurants or grocery stores."
7689901,65817823,2016-03-17,13246324,Faviola,Our host and the house was great! She responded to our emails promptly and when we had an issue with the Wi-Fi she made a special trip to the house to take care of it. The house came with two tickets to the aquarium which is walking distance. We were traveling with our 9 month baby and he had a great time at the house and can't wait to visit again. 
7689901,67596896,2016-03-30,855147,Beck,"The location and amenities were perfect for my mom and my stay for the weekend. The view was incredible, the location was great for all sorts of activities and sights (the aquarium was just a five minute walk away--so fantastic!) We thoroughly enjoyed the firepit outside and the fireplace inside. We saw so many otters and seals, just out the front door. What a special place! Kelly and Bill introduced us to the space, even though it was late when we arrived, and made us feel welcome and cared for. "
7689901,71467026,2016-04-25,4730926,Kobey,"This is the best Air BnB that we have experienced to date. 
If you think the pictures look good, wait until you see it in person!
The location is perfect and within walking distance to anything you need in Pacific Grove.

The only down side is having to leave...
Looking forward to returning soon!!

Only wished stayed longer. Went whale watching saw a Blue Whale, three Humpbacks and many Dolphins, sea lions, sun fish etc etc. had a great stay. Totally recommend. Really comfortable beds."
7689901,81535267,2016-06-23,34652587,Ashley,"We had such a great stay! The house was in the perfect location, right across from the ocean where there are paved walkways great for taking in the amazing views! It is a few blocks from everything going on down on Cannery Row and so convenient! The house itself is beautiful! We will be requesting to stay here again and again! We were so sad to leave and can't wait to return!"
7689901,82804152,2016-06-29,78676374,Phil,"Great place. Exactly as advertised. Comfortable beds, including the air mattress. Common space a little tight for 6, but you're going to be out exploring most of the day anyway. Very nice kitchen and baths. Owner super easy to deal with.  Right across the street from the harbor seals.  Highly recommended. 5 stars. The Monterey Peninsula is beautiful."

Sitting around the fire pit, watching the whales with family and friends was the absolute best.  Thank you so very much for opening your spectacular home to us.  We will definitely be back!!!"
7689901,93861877,2016-08-14,72918877,Clare,This house is an absolute gem. Great location for the aquarium and restaurants. Spectacular views across the ocean and we really enjoyed a glass of wine by the firepit. Kelly and Bill were really helpful. Wish we could have stayed longer!
7689901,96336065,2016-08-22,74718677,Matt,"This place is fantastic.  Great location and amazing view. Kelly was there to greet us, walk us through the house, recommended some great near-by restaurants and left us with a book containing all the pertinent info - like Wi-Fi login :)  I would definitely recommend this place.

7689901,98496863,2016-08-31,25154105,Alex,"Beautiful home, perfect location, and clean! We had a great stay in Pacific Grove and enjoyed everything about the place...from the firepit to the nice TV setups and even the aquarium passes. A great little getaway for a small group of friends. Everything was in excellent condition and super clean! Only one quick note: the picture represents the entire home, so be advised you are only renting the lower floor (during our stay a family lived above us - they were nice and quiet, but just a head's up!). Everything was fantastic though and as advertised!"
7689901,99702813,2016-09-05,3867618,Jones,Very fast communication and the location was wonderful--we walked to everything from the Aquarium to the grocery store.  Everything was clean and pristine.
7689901,110216834,2016-10-24,48621190,Shane,"We were extremely surprised and delighted to have the opportunity to stay at such a gorgeous home for a long stay weekend.  Not only was the home beautiful on the inside, throughout each room, but outside which included a fire pit that we used every night while listening to the waves crash against the shore directly across the street!

We had the good fortune to meet Kelly Edwards of Peninsula Realty Group who, along with her contractor and co-property management husband, showed us through the home which was recently remodeled by his firm.  This home was built in the late 1920's and has made a beautiful transformation with quality work being done.

"

7689901,121504188,2016-12-17,3609916,Brandon,"This place was great for our family of 5.  

The location is really ideal, it's a short walk to the aquarium, Cannery Row and New Monterey and about a 15 minute walk to downtown Pacific Grove.  There are tons of restaurants, shops, and stores all in walking distance.  Across the street, the bike/walking path provides great views of the beach and all sorts of wildlife.  We saw harbor seals and otters from the apartment.

The listing photos portray the apartment and surrounding area very well.  It was super clean and very well equipped.  The owner lives upstairs and greeted us when we arrived, showed us around, and let us know if we needed anything to just knock.  They were also very quiet during our stay.

My only (small) gripe - the wifi generally worked great but was spotty in the front bedroom.

We would absolutely stay here again.  Thanks!"
7689901,124667770,2017-01-02,12269733,Damian,Beautiful home in an exceptional location with gracious hosts. Couldn't ask for more. A perfect spot for a visit to the Monterey peninsula.

7689901,130373732,2017-02-05,1571861,Tad,"We had an amazing weekend for our family with two kids (ages 2 and 5). The Aquarium is a short walk away. As our numerous restaurants (like Zum Sushi) that aren't as touristy as the spots right next to the Aquarium. But, the best thing is the ocean view every morning. The coastal trail is just out the door and ideal for morning runs. Will stay there again!"
7689901,140260196,2017-03-28,68054577,Yu,"Amazing place! You have to stay here when in Monterey. It is across the street from the seals and they are pupping. You can walk everywhere including great restaurants, bakeries, aquarium, and grocery stores. Our family loved it. It's a great place for adults and kids and the place was immaculate! Great to have everything there including laundry, paper towels, etc. We are definitely coming back again if ever in Monterey. "
7689901,140967609,2017-04-01,31292530,Michelle,"Amazing! The apartment is absolutely lovely. Everything is high end and is exactly as pictured. We cooked quite a lot and had everything we needed in the kitchen and more. The view is incredible. In fact, we had one day of bad weather and were completely content to stay inside and just watch the ocean. Nice walking path in front and easy to get to the aquarium, shops and restaurants. Highly recommended. "
7689901,143614760,2017-04-12,20091059,Jennifer,"Kelly was lovely to work with. The check-in process was very easy and we were able to reach her with any questions very easily. The home was just what we were looking for size wise and had great amenities. Both fireplaces were easy to operate and really added to the ambiance of the home, The location is superb and the outdoor area was the icing on the cake!"
7689901,144815963,2017-04-16,16576580,Albert,"Kelly and Bill were very responsive before our visit answering all our questions as they came up. They met us when we checked in and were very professional and courteous. 

The house itself was beautiful and located right across from the Bay. It was also a plus that it was seal pupping season and we could watch the action right from the living room! The Aquarium is located 0.3 miles from the house so it really was just a five minute walk. It was so nice not having to worry about where to park the car. 

We didn't know this when booking the house, but it also came with two passes to the Aquarium. That was a nice bonus. "

Pros:
There are many delicious walkable restaurants
The aquarium is just a few minutes away (walking on a recreational trail)
There were seal pups just across the street!   

Cons:
Parking is on the street with two permits.  Easy after 6 on busy weekends and any other time. 
You can definitely hear the apartment above.

7689901,159300398,2017-06-10,112268154,David,"I booked this property for the final three nights of a two week family holiday to California - looking for the big finish (!) and it delivered. We'd been on a real run around trying to do and see everything so to wind up here to unwind was perfect. The property is lovely (but just to be clear its not the whole house you see in the picture, just the downstairs), was v clean and well maintained, very well equipped (inc Film channels on the TV that was great for kids in evening), comfy beds and a view to kill for. We finished our last night toasting marshmallows at the fire pit - perfect. Its fantastically located for the Aquarium / Cannery Row if you turn right (and a great supermarket a couple of blocks up) out of the front door, turn left, go round the headland and you're on 17 mile drive to Carmel / Pebble Beach etc. Not cheap, but as we found on this trip you get what you pay for and this was lovely. The worst I could say is that a couple of the hinges on the kitchen cabinets were slightly dodgy!! Oh, and two aquarium passes come with, which was a blessing as that place is ridiculously expensive (eg 30 bucks for the 7 year old)."
7689901,162846066,2017-06-22,31115160,Dana,"You can't find a better spot in Pacific Grove! The setting is just beautiful, with amazing views of the waves crashing on the rocks, seals and otters playing in the water, and fishing boats doing their things further out to sea. The fire pit on the front patio makes for an awesome time staying warm by the fire while admiring the incredible view and listening t the waves. The house is steps away from the aquarium, and the host provides 2 passes, which is worth $100 in admission fees. The place is well stocked with all the kitchen necessities (cutlery, utensils, tools, etc), and a lot of spices, oil/vinegar, etc, so don't buy anything like that until you see what's there. Two bedrooms, each with king beds and their own bathrooms. Perfect for 2 couples. "

The view is spectacular as the house is right across the street from the ocean so you can see and hear the seals as they are frolicking and sleeping. The walking path is right there so you can walk to the beach or get your morning run in. In addition, the house is perfectly located near golf courses, great restaurants, Carmel, Monterey so really easy to get wherever you want to go.   The beds are very comfortable, the kitchen very well stocked, fire pit outside and fireplace inside which makes for really cozy and fun nights. We really had a great time"

The house is well equipped for cooking. Kitchen, beds, furniture, and bath rooms are all top notch."
7689901,172030718,2017-07-19,7433447,Nicole,5-stars and 5 thrilled guests... we loved everything about the first-floor unit. Location is amazing because of its convenience and beauty. The sea otters and sea lions visible from the fire pit put this gem over the top for everyone in our group (aged 17 to 53). We all slept great in this quiet and charming home. I slept on the inflatable mattress which was shockingly comfortable. There is nothing I would change; this place has it all. Hospitality and cleanliness were perfect as well.
7689901,187871954,2017-08-27,2089511,Vanessa,Beautiful location!  It was great to have the access to the Aquarium and being so close to Cannery Row made the experience so easy with the kids.

7689901,204374127,2017-10-17,16325634,Allen,"Kelly’s place in Pacific Grove was in an amazing location right near the beach & within walking distance to Cannery Row & all of the shopping, restaurants and bars in the area. We loved it and would highly recommend it! We hope to come back and stay there again in the future!"
7689901,205030996,2017-10-20,30383309,Nick,"This place was amazing. We found it last minute after we decided to change our trip from Sonoma to Monterrey. The hosts were extremely responsive and gave our group some great recommendations. The view was outstanding looking out to the ocean, and the outside fire pit and seating was great for the evening and mornings. The location was close to everything, either a walk or a short drive, to everything worth while in the area. The amenities were everything you'd need; we cooked a couple of meals and had no problem whatsoever. Both bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and welcoming, and the common area was enough to comfortably fit two couples. I highly recommend and would definitely do again if in the area."
7689901,206110677,2017-10-23,55119428,Joanne,"What a house!!!  Beautiful location, perfectly located to see all the sites, 17 mile drive, Big Sur, Carmel, walk to Cannery Row.  We can't wait to return!"
7689901,209729154,2017-11-05,12457028,EurJean,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home as clean and well appointed, with plenty of blankets, beach towels, a well stocked kitchen, cable tv, and wifi. Parking permits and passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium were also provided. The fire place in the living room and fire pit on the patio were really great in the evenings. We even cooked dinner, breakfast, and chocolate chip cookies in the kitchen. It was wonderful to wake up in the morning and see the sun over the ocean out the window. We'd definitely stay here again."
7689901,210694087,2017-11-10,388373,O.Lidia,"Location was better than picture perfect and the house was luxurious with extremely comfortable beds, finest sheets and other  fine amenities (washer/dryer too). The home was spotless and very accommodating for two couples.  Having my morning coffee by the fire pit and making s’mores in the evening was an added bonus. Kelly’s team was easy to work with and communication was just perfect too. Planning on coming back every year😉."
7689901,211651217,2017-11-13,15082686,Corinne,"Bring good binoculars, we saw lots of whales. You can walk everywhere. Has all the basics for cooking. If your a light sleeper you may hear the guests upstairs? Blow up bed is fast an easy. But will be in the main living area so no privacy. Great location! Outdoor fire pit & fireplace add atmosphere and warmth. Enjoy! We’ll be back. Kelly makes it an easy experience."
7689901,212031607,2017-11-15,59834945,Hamid,Beautiful home in a perfect location with amazing views! Great and friendly host!
7689901,212405580,2017-11-17,50463103,Kyoonhee,Location is great. Outside sitting area is really enjoyable and peaceful.
7689901,215611783,2017-11-30,151816664,Jerry,Great house with a great view!
7689901,216386970,2017-12-03,153928864,Ed,"Incredible view of Monterey Bay and very comfortable accommodations for 2  Senior couples.  Extraordinarily Clean and pleasant environment.  Street parking  was not a challenge.  Kelly and team were very responsive to all of our needs.  We used as home base for exploring Monterey Peninsula  and area.  It was great after exploring most of the day to kick back around the fire pit and enjoy the sunset.  We highly recommend, and would definitely return to Kelly's place."
7689901,218270330,2017-12-11,4659579,Alexa,The view was lovely. The fire pit outside and the fire place inside was so cozy and perfect for a nice getaway!
7689901,218942693,2017-12-15,2134597,Diane & Steve,Wonderful place. Beautiful ocean front. Great fireplace. Comfortable furniture. Clean.
7689901,219543192,2017-12-17,68296617,Marian,Stayed here with a group of 6 girls for a bachelorette. The location was perfect as it was walking distance to everything! The space itself was so clean and the beds were extremely comfy. The outdoor fire place was perfect and the view of the ocean was incredible. Highly recommend!!
7689901,221809850,2017-12-27,127424904,Kirsty,"We loved Kelly’s place. It was beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. Great location, we could walk to everywhere we wanted to go. It was so beautiful to stay across from the water."
7689901,222402552,2017-12-29,62671020,Sarah,"Fantastic accommodations and a perfect location to explore Monterey, Carmel and Big Sur! We loved the outdoor fire pit and could hear the seals from the beach across the street at night as we enjoyed the fire! Also, a 5 minute walk to Monterey Bay aquarium and Cannery Row. We highly recommend staying at Casa Gran Vista!"
7689901,227695166,2018-01-15,2038247,Michael,"The place was awesome. Incredible location, unbeatable views, and amazing space. Couldn't be happier with our stay there!"
7689901,229462653,2018-01-23,67711287,Pamela,Great location with spectacular view of the ocean.  Outdoor seating with firepit to watch the breathtaking sunsets!  Perfect space for two couples.  Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home.
7689901,230718040,2018-01-28,3696992,Susan,"The place was perfect!  This is our third weekend trip to Pacific Grove and this is by far the best accommodations we have had.  The property manager was responsive and easy to work with.   

The location is fantastic!  Still a short walking distance from the aquarium but far enough to not have the touristy feel.  The place was wonderful.  The kitchen was well stocked with spices/olive oil in the cabinet.  We brought our own but thought I would note that for future renters of the property.   The entire place was renovated not too long ago.  They did an excellent job with furnishing the unit and not blatantly looking like it was only used as a rental and sterile looking.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.  

Thanks for the great mini vacation."
7689901,231350350,2018-01-31,49563964,Shaun,Great location! The fireplace gave us so much fun!
7689901,233052581,2018-02-07,116663866,Shaun,"Great location near Monterey Aquarium. Great view from the porch. House is  very modern inside. Can tell it has recently been updated. Bed near front of house was comfortable, cannot comment on bed in back of house as we did not use it. House had everything needed kitchen wise. Parking was no problem with the included parking passes. Instructions for the house were great. A couple negative things are you can hear the people up stairs walk around if its booked while your there. Also the shower/tub in the front most room is a little weird and will get the floor very wet if it is used as a shower."
7689901,234463610,2018-02-12,301973,Angie,"We had a wonderful stay while attending the Pebble Beach Pro-Am.  The location is fabulous with so many things within walking distance.  The ocean is literally a few feet away and Cannery Row just down the street.  The fireplace inside and fire pit outside were particular favorites.  So relaxing to sit by the fire pit enjoying a nice bottle of wine and great conversation with the relaxing sounds of the ocean just a few feet away.  The accommodation itself was very roomy, comfortable and equipped with everything we needed.  Check-in and check-out were both a breeze.  If you're in the Pacific Grove area and in search of a wonderful accommodation with an unbelievable view and fabulous location you can't go wrong choosing this property."
7689901,234928278,2018-02-14,92359713,Chao,Beautiful house and great location. Kelly was a very helpful host and respond to our query quickly. Highly recommended!
7689901,237375388,2018-02-22,130765174,Christa,Such a spectacular place. Beautifully updated and location can’t be beat. Enjoyed perfect mornings runs every day catching the trail just 20’ away. Kids rode bikes and scooters to the aquarium daily which was a five minute walk. The beds are SO comfy with gorgeous bathrooms. We had so much fun and can’t wait to return in a few months!!!
7689901,237939069,2018-02-24,105122794,Diana,"My mother, my young daughter and I stayed in this great apartment.  The view was amazing, and the location was very convenient but removed enough from the rowdy tourist scene in Monterey.  It was perfect for us because my mom and I each had our own space on opposite ends of the house.  Kelly gave us a great suggestion for dinner and quickly responded to our questions.  The apartment itself was clean and stylish.  We had a wonderful weekend and I would book the place again."
7689901,239667206,2018-03-02,6335332,Katie,"What a wonderful place to stay while in Pacific Grove. Oceanfront trail just steps from the front door and the views were fantastic. Walking distance to coffee, shops, restaurants, Cannery Row, Fishermans Wharf, and Lighthouse Ave. Kelly was super responsive and the process of a piece of cake. Would stay again in a heart beat."
7689901,240394105,2018-03-04,76847074,Charmaine,"THIS HOUSE IS AMAZING! It truly lives up to the pictures on the website. It's so warm and cozy. That view of the ocean is everything! 

Kelly had everything we needed. Towels, few basic kitchen/food items (coffee/filters), blankets to sit out by the firepit etc.. The fireplace inside was the first thing we got going once we arrived. The binder with all the directions, welcome, and menus.The kitchen is fully stocked with everything will needs for their home away from home. It truly was like being at home. It was the perfect get away for some R&R and a girls trip. All the girls had an amazing time. We loved getting up to see the view of the ocean and we got up each morning to go walk and enjoy nature. 

The only issue we had is that we could hear everything above us. The above unit was rented out as well and it was hard to get to sleep the first night. I actually had to put on sleep sounds to drown out the walking around. But once i was sleep I was sleep lol! The bed is really comfy. 

We can't wait to come back. Thank you so much!!"
7689901,241591650,2018-03-09,173429052,Louis,Great property.  Wonderful view and gr at amenities.   Love the fire pit and view on a a sunny afternoon.
7689901,245817695,2018-03-23,28716355,James,"Kelly's place was perfect and the location was simply amazing! Walking distance from the Aquarium and the shops/restaurants in Cannery Row and Pacific Grove. Stunning view from the apartment with harbour seals on the beach right outside! Fire pit was a great bonus too, perfect for sharing a few drinks on a spring evening. Slightly over our normal travel budget but certainly well worth the extra :)"
7689901,246566756,2018-03-25,33991618,Nicholas,Kelly’s place cannot accurately be described with words!  When you first arrive you just know and feel like you’re going to have a magical time!
7689901,249149912,2018-04-01,16065774,Lloyd,Loved the house  - location is fantastic and you can't beat the seals right across the street. The house has been very well updated and is top-notch inside. We would definitely stay there again.
7689901,250971921,2018-04-06,28192996,Tanya,"Kelly's place was lovely. The house itself was very clean, spacious and beautifully renovated. There were many thoughtful touches such as the blankets for out by the fire pit. We loved sitting out by the fire looking across the bay in the evenings.  The location is outstanding with gorgeous views across the harbour and the beach (with seals and pups!) just across the road. Kelly was a great host and responded immediately to every query and was very helpful. We couldn't have asked for a better place for our few days in Monterey Bay. We highly recommend it."
7689901,251905746,2018-04-08,108640814,Kevin,"This is a very beautiful home in a great location. The ocean is right across the street, and the waves crashing on the rocks sounds amazing. Near by food and brews."
7689901,252481761,2018-04-10,174747973,Denis,"Great place to stay! Beautiful clean house, very responsive owners and an excellent location!"
7698728,96377253,2016-08-22,17313686,Casey,Jonathan called me to make sure I knew where they were located and my arrival was going as planned. Nice couple and very welcoming.  The room is very private and nice location.
7698728,184436340,2017-08-19,42527409,Paul,Everything with the room was as advertised and there is a fantastic view of the bay from the back patio.  It was fabulous! The Roeloffs are wonderful hosts and they both greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the property and the room. Very nice and friendly people. We would be very pleased to stay there again.
7842731,43191279,2015-08-17,1871917,Vasan,"We had a great time at Eddie and Miko's lovely, clean and neat home,  located in the picturesque town of Pacific Grove. Our party of 6 - two couples and two kids, were warmly welcomed by Miko and her daughter, who graciously gave us a tour of the home, and made us feel comfortable. The home is set in a quiet and serene neighborhood, with close access to Highway 68 and Highway 1.   Everything was perfect! We highly recommend it."
7842731,43573093,2015-08-20,41333291,Laura,"This ""simple getaway"" is just as promised!  The hosts personally met us at the property (we actually had to change our arrival time several times as PCH 1, while gorgeous, can be a slow route) and were so gracious about our changing arrival times. They acquainted us to the house and amenities. And they provided written material about the area - attractions, restaurants, etc.

The house was wonderfully nestled in a very nice, quiet, walk-able neighborhood.  The drive into Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel was easy and very navigable.  Local eateries were nearby and very good.

The location of the home also made exploring on foot quite easy (well, leaving was easy - it was all down hill!  Getting back home was definitely a great uphill workout!).  Forests and parks seem to weave throughout this area very nonchalantly.  

This was our first experience with Airbnb and we will definitely use this service again!  We enjoyed our stay at this listing and would definitely stay here again.  So much nicer than a sterile hotel and we felt more like we were part of the area instead of just visitors!"
7842731,44039790,2015-08-23,13873460,Lynne,"Eddie, Miko, and their daughter, Kanoa, were extremely gracious and conscientious hosts. They responded quickly to questions and were very open and flexible to our requests. They met us when we arrived to give us a good orientation of their home. Their home was the perfect size for our party of five and well-stocked with everything we needed like cooking essentials, coffee, tea, and milk. The Tempurpedic bed was very comfortable. They provided many extras that made us feel welcomed and appreciated. We couldn't have asked for better or more thoughtful hosts!"
7842731,44991303,2015-08-30,5211190,Dan,everything was what they said it was. nice cozy home. soaking tub! 10 minute drive to Aquarium. 2 min drive to Trader Joes. Very nice time. 
7842731,45834114,2015-09-06,232761,Alejandra,"We had the most lovely time at Eddie and Miko's home. It was very cozy, clean, and perfect for our family of 4. Miko even brought us food for the kids and our dog! We originally had only planned to stay two nights, but decided to stay an extra night because we were enjoying our stay so much. There was a payment issue with airbnb but they did all they could to fix it! They are lovely people and SUPER talented too! We saw Eddie play at the aquarium. We definitely will be back!

Ps- If you have a dog, they do have a bit of poison oak in the backyard, so just check it out first before letting kids/dogs run out there. They warn guests about it in their house book, but we read it too late!"
7842731,46537216,2015-09-11,16425417,Adam,"Eddie and Miko's place was awesome! They were there to greet us, gave us recommendations about the area, and even had a birthday card with a $20 Trader Joes gift certificate for us because I had told them my girlfriend and I were coming to the area for my birthday. Super nice people and a great spot!"
7842731,47275731,2015-09-17,37304188,Ashley,"Miko was a great host and she was so sweet, meeting us in person to show us the house and go over amenities and the area with us. She made sure we had everything we needed and even had some welcome snacks for us (these came in handy)! She also let us use their 2 guest passes to the aquarium which helped save some money! The location was great and home had everything we needed. Very clean and comfortable for the 6 of us."
7842731,47727588,2015-09-21,4515068,Christine,"Never had a host so generous. Grapes, coffee and creamer was the least they did for us! The place was a great size for a family and had such a great view and patio. They were super flexible with checkin and all was wonderful! "
7842731,48158374,2015-09-23,44899127,Diva,The host canceled this reservation 64 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7842731,48540855,2015-09-27,4144680,Andrew,"Eddie and Miko were wonderful hosts. We rented their home for a relaxing weekend getaway and got exactly what we were looking for. We were greeted at the door, given a tour and advice about the surrounding area, and we found the area to have terrific attractions to enjoy. I recommend their home to all visitors!"
7842731,49347656,2015-10-03,43132715,Jeremy And Mariko,"Eddie and Miko were a delightful in welcoming our group of 6. 

The deep tub and hot bath was wonderful while thinking about the crisp air outside. We looked forward each night to coming home and soaking in it. 

You can see and hear (I think) the ocean from the deck. Tall pines spot the block of homes, which makes for a cabin-like setting. The two back rooms are very quite and private, and has a wonderful view of their private oak tree dotted hillside.

Eddie and Miko followed up with us to make sure we knew where to eat and get needed amenities. 
"
7842731,49620315,2015-10-05,40740125,Michael,"My family and I (six in total) stayed in Eddie & Miko's house during our travel in Monterey. We really loved their house: artistic design, tidy and comfortable bed, short but clear guide to use their kitchen stuff, and yummy snacks and chocolate for guests! We will definitely come back, and refer their house to whom want to stay in Monterey area!"
7842731,50294790,2015-10-11,9566583,Brooke & Rich,Great home in a great area. Great value and willing to accommodate. Will definitely look to stay again when in the area. 
7842731,50782796,2015-10-14,44859135,Jonathan,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Eddie+Miko's house. They were very friendly and gave us the tour of the house. The house was big enough for 7 of the family members that stayed there. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. 2 mins from Trader Joes, resturants, grocery store and 10 mins from cannery row area. If we find ourselves staying in Monterey, we will see if this house is available again. Thanks Eddie+Miko for being GREAT hosts!"
7842731,51535657,2015-10-21,2911059,Amy,"We really enjoyed our vacation to the coast and it was a much needed one for my mom who used to come here often.  She really enjoyed being able to have her own room and it was so nice to have a place for my kids to sleep separately as well.  Miles better than a hotel!  The neighborhood is quiet, and the enclosed patio in the front was great for our little doggy.  I appreciated that all of the basic amenities were present and I loved the shower!  Very relaxing and tall enough for me.  Miko and Eddie were very sweet and helpful.  They even installed blinds before our arrival as I mentioned that it's hard for my kids to sleep upon the arrival of light!  All the mommies know what I'm talking about.  Overall a very nice experience, thank you for sharing your home with us!"
7842731,51920846,2015-10-25,44049064,Diana,Eddie and Mike were fantastic hosts - they were super friendly and generous with their home.  They thoughtfully provided dining recommendations and park recommendations and were flexible about the check-in time.  Their house was lovely and well-equipped - we had everything we needed and then some!  And we loved the soaking tub!
7842731,52740113,2015-11-01,32866029,Ronald,Miko was very helpful in getting us situated.  The is house is in a quiet residential neighborhood and is as described in the listing.  You will need a car to get to the downtown.  All in all it is very pleasant.
7842731,53458663,2015-11-09,7785642,Amy,"Eddie and Miko are a delightful couple who greeted us upon our arrival. We could tell they really cared about the enjoyment of our experience and made us feel very at home. The cozy space was perfect for the four of us. We appreciated the abundance of coffee (a must for waking up before dawn to run a half marathon!), and we loved the wood burning stove at night while we relaxed after the race.  The location was on a pretty, forested hill overlooking the ocean. It was quite convenient to get to dinner in Pacific Grove and to the starting line in Monterey. We would recommend Eddie and MIko's space to anyone! Thanks!"
7842731,54027358,2015-11-15,47788337,Elaine,"Eddie and Miko were great hosts to work with.  They responded very promptly to any questions I had, provided helpful information, and accommodating of my late check-in. Although unfortunately I never had the opportunity to meet them in person, they were very friendly, welcoming, and courteous in their correspondences. The house is very clean, comfortable, and contained all the amenities to make our visit a very pleasant one.  Appreciated the Aquarium guest passes and the clear notes and instructions throughout the home to help us find things.  I would stay in their home again in the future! "
7842731,54584427,2015-11-22,10837678,David,They met us when we arrived and answered all of our questions.  I felt like I was talking to dear friends.  The neighborhood was quiet and close to the Bay and Aquarium as well as a neighborhood school with a play ground which we used the first afternoon for our two year old grand daughter.  The location had easy access to going to restaurants in the area.  
7842731,55201390,2015-11-29,13241409,Felix,"Eddie and Miko are awesome hosts.  They are very considerate and the house was well stocked.  We particularly enjoyed the aquarium guest passes, the wood stove and the yard that allowed our lab some room to roam.  Its also super close to Asilomar, Carmel and the aquarium as well."
7842731,57117909,2015-12-22,44520132,Natalia M.,Eddie and Miko were so lovely and welcoming. The house was perfect for our family vacation and comfortably accommodated the five of us (plus a small dog). The house was really nice and super clean. The beds were comfy and kitchen had everything we needed. It was a great getaway. I would definitely stay here again next time I make my way upto the area! Thanks for a great getaway! 
7842731,57440682,2015-12-26,48016024,Mark,"Eeddie and Miko's house is very nice with everything you need and close to all the attractions. The house is beautiful, clean and very well organized. The host are very friendly and helpful. We will certainly come back to their house if we get a chance to visit the Pacific Grove area in the future. Mark from Boston"
7842731,57885610,2015-12-30,27215610,Susie,We received a warm welcome from our hosts Eddie & Miko.  Their house was 100% as described-charming & cozy in a quiet residential neighborhood. A very comfortable spot and communication/keys/guest guides were all a breeze.
7842731,61687286,2016-02-07,39161232,Anastasia,"Staying at Eddie and Miko's place was such a joy. They were so friendly, and left us little notes and chocolates. The listing was very accurate. The house was within easy driving access to Pacific Grove the beach. Eddie and Miko made me feel very welcomed! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quiet, quaint space."
7842731,62487600,2016-02-15,46813785,Shelbi,Eddie and Miko were a delight. They were only out shined by the home itself. We needed a great place to stay for a group of six during the PGA tournament at Pebble Beach and the location and accommodations were perfect. The house was spotless and had everything we needed. There are great places to eat and restaurants VERY close by. The beds were so comfortable and the soaking tub was much appreciated after a long day on the course! I did not want to leave!
7842731,63193628,2016-02-21,50078155,Julie,"My sisters and I had a fun weekend at Eddie & Miko's home. It was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Would recommend you bring DVDs if you want to watch movies. They were both very friendly and accommodating. It is close to everything we wanted to see. We also used the two passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium - a nice touch. Great people - great home!"
7842731,64500819,2016-03-05,22906546,Roberta,They responded well and quickly to emails.  They were obliging when we needed to leave our dog their before the check-in time.  They provided 2 passes to the Monterey Aquarium.   The house was clean and neat.  The common spaces are relatively small and not that comfortable. 
7842731,64787119,2016-03-08,51932926,Kevin,"What an amazing property! But what was even better was how gracious and available our hosts were throughout our entire stay. We arrived extremely late, and we were given the opportunity to stay extra late on our check-out date. You cannot put a price on how gracious and available a host is for out-of-town guests. They couldn't have been better. To top it off, I asked them if they could get a BBQ grille for their amazing deck..... They did! Ocean View! Couple of miles from some of the best golf in the entire world! Would recommend to everybody staying in the area!"
7842731,66073947,2016-03-19,41067382,Timothy,"Eddie and Miko are wonderful hosts.  Miko greeted my two children and I at the door, answering all our questions and making us feel very welcome.  The cottage was very well appointed and tastefully decorated.  The Japanese soaking tube was a wonderful bonus."
7842731,66412563,2016-03-22,10437558,John,"Beautiful place!!! Had a wonderful time.
But best part is how amazing Eddie and Miko were... They are the greatest!!!"
7842731,67506138,2016-03-29,13063132,Anna,"My husband's family and I stayed at Eddie & Miko's for 4 days and had the most wonderful time. Miko was there to greet us, the house was in perfect condition and they were even kind enough to leave fresh flowers, Easter eggs and a birthday card and present for my mother-in-law! The beds were super comfy, the kitchen was great to cook in and we enjoyed hanging out in the open plan lounge/dining area. They left us loads of useful info and the use of 2 guest aquarium passes. We were so touched by their attentiveness, it was better than staying in any hotel I have ever been in. Thank you so much Eddie & Miko! Anna and family."
7842731,68163628,2016-04-02,61028825,Amy,"My family and I stayed at Eddie and Miko's for 2 nights.   Our hosts were very easy to communicate with and quickly addressed a plumbing problem. We loved their apartment! Good location, very clean and comfortable.  The aquarium passes are a plus. We hope to have a chance to stay here again in the future."
7842731,68911251,2016-04-07,63100741,Lynn Marie,Eddie and Miko are such wonderful hosts. They thought of everything. We had everything we needed and more. It was a beautiful house. Quiet neighborhood. Even got to hear 'Taps' at 10pm sharp every night. We walked to the aquarium it was so close. You won't find better then this. 
7842731,69232011,2016-04-10,1356992,Michael,"Eddie and Miko's place was clean, affordable, and in a great location. I would certainly stay there again in the future."
7842731,71382508,2016-04-25,2249719,Justin & Lyndi,Thank you both for the amazing hospitality!! Your house was so beautiful and just what we needed during our stay. Loved that you all knew what we were there for and made the trip even more special! Can't wait to return for the Big Sur Marathon next years! Until then! 
7842731,72414519,2016-05-02,8130346,Ellen,"Miko and Eddie were there when we arrived a little early, putting the finishing touches on the housecleaning, so we were able to meet them. They are lovely: very welcoming and helpful. They gave us some information about the area, but the house also had written info and resources. House rules were clear and reasonable. The house itself is very sweet and met our needs perfectly. It had 3 comfortable bedrooms, which provided enough space for us and our friends. The outdoor sitting areas--a deck in front and little tables in back---were adorable. We sat on the front deck (pictured in the listing) and looked out over the neighborhood. The neighborhood is great--small houses, families, dogs-- and we enjoyed some hilly morning walks. The only disadvantage to the neighborhood, as Eddie had told us, is that visitors do need a car to get in to town to explore. This was not a big issue for us, but might be for visitors prefer not to have to drive to town or who prefer the in-town Pacific grove experience."
7842731,77238120,2016-05-30,54189091,Cesar,"Everything was like the photos, super clean and nice, the house is in a perfect area and Eddie was a great host, one of the best airbnb's spots so far"
7842731,78172350,2016-06-05,61721641,Anna,"Eddie and Miko are wonderful hosts with a wonderful home in a wonderful location. We (two families) came here with 4 adults, a 4-year old, a 2-year old, and a 1.5-year old. Although I definitely wouldn't describe the home as child-friendly (neither do they!), it was very practically furnished and I wasn't constantly worried about things being broken. Eddie and Miko were both so kind and gracious. I'm hoping to be back in the Monterey area in the not-to-distant future and will definitely look for their home as the first option to stay."
7842731,79011776,2016-06-10,7281478,Ingrid,The house was lovely and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was great and close to the quaint town of Pacific Grove. There was a pretty garden in front. They had flowers in a vase and let us eat their leftover food. Beds were comfortable. Great place.
7842731,79317534,2016-06-12,55604043,Grace,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Miko and Eddie's home did not disappoint.  It was such a cozy home, and perfect for the family of 3 adults, a teen and our two Shih Tzu puppies.  Miko was there to greet us upon arrival, and answered all questions we had.  She also left us a nice card which was truly thoughtful. We love the patio, and enjoyed a couple of meals there.  The photos are accurate, and home in a very nice location.  I highly recommend this home, and would come back to stay."
7842731,83001815,2016-06-30,14422865,Heidi,Eddie & Miko were great hosts!  They we're very accommodating and let us pick up the aquarium  passes early so we could spend the afternoon there before checking in.  Their place was comfortable  and clean just like the pictures.  They made sure we had no issues getting in.  Definitely a wonderful place to stay.
7842731,84015698,2016-07-05,2318127,Irene,"We loved staying at Eddie and Miko's home.  It was super comfortable, clean and fully stocked with coffee, basic food items (i.e. steelcut oatmeal and rice) and cooking supplies.  We also loved the Monterey Aquarium passes and used them two days in a row. And Miko is a super sweet host.  We'd definitely stay here again if we were to return to Monterey."
7842731,86027834,2016-07-14,55156208,Ian,"Eddie & Miko were excellent hosts. Their house was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 2 teenage boys. Their house was exactly as described and shown in the pictures and is ideally located for Monterey, Carmel and of course, downtown Pacific Grove. I don't think we could have chosen a better location for our stay."
7842731,88274251,2016-07-23,1039776,Frederick,"We had a wonderful time at Eddie's & Miko's place in Pacific Grove. Both hosts welcomed us in person even if we were late due to heavy traffic. They gave us and extensive tour of the property and plenty of good tips to explore the surroundings. The area is amazing. We loved Pacific Grove (great dining spots), Monterey (the aquarium & whales spotting cruise from Old Fisherman's Wharf), Carmel By The Sea, Point Lobos State Park, Big Sur,... 4 days to remember! "
7842731,89990037,2016-07-30,14671075,Jo,Eddie and Miko were great hosts who were keen to ensure that we had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.
7842731,92125366,2016-08-07,60801931,Gabriele,"The house is pretty and comfortable, spotlessly clean and in a great location. The hosts are wonderful and took really good care of us. Perfect lodging if you are visiting the Carmel area. "
7842731,94449414,2016-08-15,8159398,Morag,"We arrived at Eddie and Miko’s place after a long day’s drive and found a wonderful welcome – a note on their blackboard, some fruit and chocolate and a Trader Joe’s gift card.  Not only that, they were very understanding of our delay and told us where to find the key.  Had we arrived earlier they would have met us in person.  We were fortunate to meet Miko the next day and she was a delight to talk to.  The house itself was perfect for our group of three - myself and my two teenage children.  It was lovely to have a room each, all the bedrooms were comfortable, and the living room, dining area and kitchen were wonderfully laid out and thoughtfully equipped.  Outside at the front there is a little terrace that looks great for warm weather.  Eddie and Miko have an information folder which tells you the most important things to know about the house – so helpful when you have  a question and want a quick answer, and if we didn’t find it there, we knew we could contact Miko or Eddie.  We have no hesitation in recommending this place wholeheartedly."
7842731,96139061,2016-08-21,47668970,Glenn,GREAT experience! Eddie and Miko did everything ensure a great stay for my family and friends. 
7842731,99399732,2016-09-04,49752469,Anna,"We love Eddie and Miko's cozy house! We love to stay here again:) We went to the hotel for wedding rehearsal in the afternoon on the checkin day, so we were not able to meet the host personally. Our guest had to stay in the house for a while before we were back. He said the hosts are super friendly and he felt like staying at home.  "
7842731,100309065,2016-09-08,31943183,Rick,Eddie and Miko's place was perfect for our group of 6 - it was such a cozy house with careful decorations that it really feels like a family place. The location is also perfect for our day trips to 17 miles and big sur. Eddie and Miko even prepared cookie and champaigne when we arrive which was such a wonderful surprise! I would recommend Eddie&Miko's place to anyone.
7842731,101029508,2016-09-11,69669814,James,"Miko was there to greet us when we arrived and could not have been more welcoming! She was lovely. There was fresh fruit for us, coffee, toiletries... The guidebook was clear with what was expected and also had helpful information. "
7842731,103462787,2016-09-22,48377025,Sabine,"Miko & Eddie`s Haus ist ein wirklich wundervoller Ort. Das Haus befindet sich in einer angenehmen, ruhigen Umgebung. Es ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, mit viel Aufmerksamkeit zum Detail, sehr sauber und hat uns vom ersten Augenblick an ein Gefühl des Wohlbefindens vermittelt. Der Blumenstrauss und die Obstschale auf dem Tisch, alle so angenehmen Basics eines Haushaltes, sowie die Eintrittskarte zum Aquarium - es war wirklich bezaubernd. Auf jeden Fall ist eine Buchung bei Miko und Eddie zu empfehlen!"
7842731,105873257,2016-10-03,79162861,Holly,"There's always that uncertainty of how a hotel or home you view online will be when you arrive, pictures and descriptions can only do so much, but we were so happy with the place when we arrived. It was even better than expected. We have a 2 year old and brought along grandma and grandpa as well so there were a total of 5 people staying there. The neighborhood was very conveniently located, and quiet. Eddie and Miko were so nice and we will definitely stay there again!"
7842731,109149160,2016-10-19,2911059,Amy,"We totally enjoyed our second stay here, wonderful hosts and location. "
7842731,111306502,2016-10-30,93762750,Gloria,"The home was clean and welcoming. Miko and Eddie did a great job having some fruits, milk and juice for us.  The $20 gift certificate to Trader Joe's was an unexpected pleasant surprise! This is my first Airbnb booking and I've always been somewhat skeptical. However, Miko has changed that with her prompt response and willingness to accommodate an additional well-behaved dog. The home is very comfortable, location is excellent, and price is very reasonable. I will book this listing again and I highly recommend this location! "
7842731,112594648,2016-11-06,5136247,Kelvin,"Very cute and clean home, conveniently located near everything one might need. Eddie and Miko were both very kind and hospitable. Would look forward to another stay in the future when in the area!! THANK YOU!!"
7842731,113964729,2016-11-14,10837678,David,"Eddie and Miko were at the home as expected  and had left us a message on my husbands phone as well.  My daughter and husband got there before us and received information from there.  We had stayed there also a year before and knew what to expect.  The house was very, very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The area is quiet and being on a slope you have a view of the area."
7842731,114914222,2016-11-20,39356702,Kelly,Great house! Very well equipped with anything you would need. They even had a high chair for us to use! They allowed us to use guest aquarium passes which was awesome ($100 value). Had a great stay. Would definitely stay there again/recommend. 
7842731,116046509,2016-11-27,19003136,Josh,Very cozy comfortable stay. Beds were super comfortable the bathroom with this shower and soaking tub were awesome the soaking tub looks like its to small but its deep and very comfortable for one person everything else you can possibly need is there!

7842731,123114750,2016-12-27,53896613,Fei,"Eddie and Miko's place is my best experience at airbnb by far. They kindly accomodated us during the holidays. The place is very cozy and clean, with a quiet and scenic neighbourhood. Very close to 17 Mile Drive and downtown monterey. The house is well docorated with music elements, we share their love for music. My friends got a chance to play the their piano, great experience. 

I will definite come again and recommend my friends to stay at Eddie & Miko's place. "

7842731,127219581,2017-01-16,7558727,Amy,"As advertised - a small, comfortable place for a relaxing long weekend. Communication was prompt, Eddie and Miko were on-site to give us a tour of the place, and I liked that the house felt lived-in."

The hosts Eddie and Miko were very friendly, accomodating and within easy reach via text.  They included two aquarium guest passes,  which we made use of (it was a very nice experience)  and a trader joe's gift card.  Would recommend! "
7842731,131530027,2017-02-12,876263,Tyler,Great place adjacent to Monterey and golf courses. A short 10 minute drive to downtown Carmel. Safeway and Trader Joe's all within a short drive to house. We were greeted by Miko who made sure we were settled before she left. She offered suggestions and made sure we knew where everything was. 
7842731,135162999,2017-03-03,57784590,Beverly,"We all felt that the place was very good value for expensive Pacific Grove.  It's really convenient to the Aquarium, Carmel shopping, Point Lobos, and so many other local attractions.  The kitchen is well enough equipped that it's easy to actually cook a meal, and we also made use of the handy gas barbeque.  Eddie was very communicative and gave us some good suggestions.  We appreciated the aquarium passes too!"
7842731,135704056,2017-03-05,657090,Neha,"Eddie and Miko were responsive, accommodating, sweet and the place is beautiful! Thank you so much for everything :)"

7842731,141321198,2017-04-02,30619278,Chester,"Eddie and Miko have a great place for a quiet getaway. It's quaint, with a mix of old and new. The updated spaces are nicely done, including a very nice Japanese-style garden in front, a nicely appointed full bathroom, and a tastefully furnished living room. It's very comfortable, with thoughtful touches throughout the house. Everything worked as advertised and/or was self-explanatory. The hosts also went out of their way to make us feel taken care of, including a Trader Joe's gift card. And when we accidentally left an important personal item behind, they were kind enough to coordinate to get it back to us."
7842731,144845238,2017-04-16,119712836,Elizabeth,We enjoyed our stay and Eddie and Miko's home.  It was just as expected and very cozy.  They met us at the house and were so nice and helpful.

7842731,148406320,2017-04-30,66206754,Kendra,"Eddie and Miko truly went out of their way to make my family and me feel welcomed and comfortable. We arrived to fresh fruit, a gift card to Trader Joe's, and two aquarium passes that we were able to use! The house was clean and just as lovely as it appears in their photos. We stayed for 3 nights and the location allowed us quick access to dog beaches in Carmel, Fisherman's wharf and Cannary Row in Monterey, and all the quaintness that PG has to offer. It was also just as lovely to stay at the house and take advantage of the beautiful patio. When we left, we forgot a baby blanket, and Eddie and Miko were so gracious as it to mail it to us! I would highly recommend staying here on any trip to PG!"
7842731,151952366,2017-05-14,22962846,Courtney,"Eddie and Miko are amazing hosts. The house comfortably slept 6 adults and 3 babies, and we could have easily had another person on the couch bed. It's a 4 minute drive to the grocery store and 5 minute drive from Spanish Bay, which is a huge plus! Just off the 17 mile drive and ocean view from the front porch. The cleanliness of the house exceeded expectations and the communication with our hosts was awesome--they are so nice and friendly.  "
7842731,153661216,2017-05-21,8005534,Amy,"We had a great time staying at Eddie and Miko's!

7842731,155190548,2017-05-27,33600713,Jane,"Your home was fantastic! It was close to Carmel and Big Sur where we spent much time at. The three bedrooms with comfortable beds were so appreciated by my family. The piano was great for my daughter who loved to play for us. We had everything we needed in the kitchen. Thank you for the Trader Joe's gift card! We love that store. We would have gone to the Aquarium but we didn't have enough time. Your house was perfect for us! I sure loved the Japanese tub!
"
7842731,156092119,2017-05-29,16455173,Stephanie,"Amazing, comfortable house very clean and close to all the Monterey and Pacific Grove activities. Our group loved the living room - sunlight couches, large table for board games, and piano, the bedrooms with super comfy beds, and the huge, clean bathroom. We also loved the personal touches around the house and the notes left on how to use things. Hosts and houses like these are the reason AirBnB is awesome. I would definitely come back again. "
7842731,157850448,2017-06-04,52481510,Alicia,Thank you Eddie and Miko for having us stay at your beautiful home.

7842731,192673524,2017-09-10,2339903,Dana And Sky,"Two moms and two daughters stayed at the house for the weekend and it was great. Comfortable, clean, plenty of room for us to be together but having three bedrooms meant we had some privacy too.
Neighborhood was totally quiet. Miko and Eddie were lovely to communicate with. 
Location to aquarium and Cannery Row was excellent (a short drive).
A great trip!"
7842731,193740640,2017-09-14,79578947,Leonel,Really wonderful home!! Three spacious bedrooms. Very lovely neighborhood. Close to Monterey shops and restaurants.

There was  enough space for our family of five and the drive to Cannery Row was about 10 mins away. Loved the quiet neighborhood! Such a gracious host and would highly recommend this house to stay in. She even gave us a $15 Trader Joe's gift card for food and drink. Such hospitality!
7842731,199373562,2017-10-01,13162202,Jessie,"Eddie and Miko’s place was delightful. Not only are they wonderful hosts, but the house itself was comfortable, centrally located, and well furnished.

Thank you, Eddie and Miko for being so wonderful!"
7842731,200801179,2017-10-06,23230437,Anna,Eddie and Miko were very kind and helpful during our stay. They have a beautiful home with many accommodations to make it feel like home away from home. It's easy to get to and close to many things in the area. I would recommend the place to anyone!
7842731,202078196,2017-10-09,25629574,Carol,A very comfortable and centrally located home. Located in a very quiet and charming area. We enjoyed the beaches the nature park and the proximity to Carmel-by-the-sea.
7842731,203825485,2017-10-15,1597209,Anthony,"Eddie & Miko were responsive and easy to communicate with from the start.  Eddie greeted us upon check-in/arrival which totally wasn't needed but always a nice touch. House is located on quiet street and pretty close to Monterey and not too far from Carmel. Cozy, but more than enough room for 6 adults. We had some meals out on the front deck soaking in that CA sun and used the fireplace one of the colder nights. And, the $15 Trade Joe's gift card is a very nice gesture."
7842731,205740876,2017-10-22,2088091,Robin,Eddie and Miko's home is in a fabulous location and we had a wonderful time.

7842731,213120624,2017-11-19,50990425,Christopher,"Thanks for the great stay. Eddie was a GREAT host! Excellent communication, house was clean and very comfy, and the place had a very quaint but awesome outdoor patio. Would definitely recommend this place to those who are looking for a nice, cozy, comfortable and quiet place to stay with friends and/or family. 

Also, Eddie and Miko were extremely thoughtful and left me a gift card as I was there for my birthday. So sweet!"
7842731,214120171,2017-11-24,29242572,Tamara,"Thanks Eddie & Miko!  We enjoyed staying at your ""Matcha"" house in Pacific Grove.  There was plenty of room, and the beds were comfortable, and the expandable sofa too.  Loved the deep soaking tub and bathroom, and all the thoughtful accommodations.  The large deck was a great place to relax and enjoy the view.  It was fun to explore the area too.  We liked walking through nearby hiking trails off Congress Rd. that you suggested.   Very happy your place was available for our semi-annual visit with our parents.  We definitely will consider renting from you again in the future.  Also, thank you for the Trader Joe's gift card, and for the use of your guitar strap Eddie.  Next time we're out we'd love to attend one of your performances.  Warmly, Tamara & Chris & Gabe Lauren"
7842731,220984974,2017-12-24,71393098,David,"The Matcha House is a cute little spot that somehow manages to feel secluded (in a good way) while being 5-10 minutes from everywhere. The house itself has lots of nice perks including a well-equipped kitchen which my wife used to bake scones, an upright piano, and best of all, a Japanese style soaking bathtub. Eddie and Miko’s hospitality was top notch, and they were very responsive to messages. I definitely hope to stay there again!"
7842731,221776151,2017-12-27,21956432,Elaine,"We loved staying at Eddie and Miko's house.  It was spotless and comfortable, and very conveniently located for the aquarium, walking on the coast, and getting up to Elkhorn slough for kayaking with sea otters!  

The beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen nicely equipped for a family that likes to cook together--although it was challenging to put more than one person in there at a time as it was very small.  

There were lovely touches such as fresh flowers and some fruit on our arrival.  

While we had no difficulties or issues to resolve, a text message let us know that if anything were to arise it would have been handled quickly.  

We highly reccommend this lovely small house for anyone who wants to enjoy Monterey and the coast."
7842731,232426128,2018-02-04,13218608,Simone,"This was our first weekend away with our 9 weeks little one and it was great to spend this time at Eddie and Miko's place. The house is perfect, Eddie is super nice and the location is just second to none to enjoy the area. Definitely recommend and I hope we'll be back soon."
7842731,234467785,2018-02-12,4956534,Mark,"Loved the place.  Pacific grove is our favorite stop of the year.  Such a cute place with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Communication was great and check in was super easy.  Place is just as advertised, plenty of room for 3,  and a lovely renovated bathroom as a bonus."
7842731,236259879,2018-02-18,521854,Joelle,Eddie and Miko’s Home was perfect for us.  Great quiet location.  It was exactly what we were looking for!
7842731,236892197,2018-02-20,1356992,Michael,Stayed at Eddie & Miko's place again and love it again. Highly recommended!
7842731,238965257,2018-02-27,24618724,Kristina,Eddie and Mike were great hosts! The Matcha House is in a great location and it was so cute! Definitely recommend!
7842731,243101962,2018-03-14,3208612,Nelson,"Convenient location and good local tips. Tickets and gift cards were good. Small rooms but big beds. Quiet, we slept well. TV was too complicated to control."
7842731,246574389,2018-03-25,32543752,Cecelia,"Everything about Eddie and Miko's home was fantastic. They made sure every detail was taken care of and given thought. My girlfriends and I came in for our high school reunion--which was fraught with so much excitement. This home offered extreme comfort and solitude, and incredible amenities. A perfect spot with perfect hosts. We would absolutely stay again!"
7842731,247474965,2018-03-28,157267505,Robin,"Many nice amenities made this a comfortable, welcoming place.  Three good beds, an attractive master bath, and eminently comfortable living room sofas for kids' sleeping were perfect for us.  Fresh flowers, coffee, spices, good kitchen appointments, were all appreciated.  Nice residential neighborhood.  We were very happy with our visit."
7842731,249169488,2018-04-01,98101949,Megan,"Eddie & Miko were great and very responsive. The place was perfect for a weekend away with my parents and my boyfriend (and our little dog!). There was enough space that we weren't on top of each other. Clean and had nice touches like a Trader Joe's gift card, aquarium tickets, and fresh flowers on the table. Overall a great airbnb experience!"
7842731,250308835,2018-04-04,96200386,Scott,"I would highly recommend The Macha House!  It is clean, quiet, and spacious.  Eddie and Miko decorated the space well and had multiple amenities.  We comfortably slept 4 people."
8035008,66460084,2016-03-22,1223074,Dinah,Rebecca is a very welcoming host providing useful information about the area.  She also generously provided welcome amenities.
8035008,71518717,2016-04-25,5924059,Fabiana,Rebecca was a great host. She sent information before the trip. Offered to help in case we needed more information. When we got in her place she came to welcome us. Made a tour in her house and explained every detail we needed. We recommended it for sure. The jacuzzi was great and one big plus to the place. We didn't use the sauna but it was available for us too. The place is located in a peaceful place and plenty space in the street to park.  
8035008,77239241,2016-05-30,9542162,Sarah,"Our overall experience was below our expectations, primarily driven by inaccurate photos and the high price point.

There were several positive aspects worth mentioning.  Rebecca was a friendly host that communicated clearly and promptly via email and things were clearly labeled in the home.  She also respected our privacy during our stay.  The location was fantastic and street parking was plentiful.  Finally the beds and bedding were very nice and included memory foam.  

The biggest issues with our stay were that the home and yard area were both extremely cluttered, somewhat unclean, and not completely ready for visitors.  

There was excessive furniture (e.g., 3 armoires and a couple of benches in the main area of the house not shown in pictures) and décor throughout the house, including things from the holiday season 5 months prior and a rotten pumpkin out front.  Also, there was cat fur on a couple of rugs.  The bathroom sink handle was broken as was the fan which was very dirty.  While the sleeping arrangements worked for the three of us, the description on the page for the main room seems to be inaccurate as there was no couch to sleep on in the bedroom.

We had a hard time finding room for our limited luggage and the kitchen did not allow for easy prep.  There were ants on the counter crawling to an ant trap, the freezer was full, and nearly all condiments offered for use were expired.   We had planned to cook at the house for 4 adults and ended up going to a restaurant and cooking at our friend's place instead.

While the pictures of the yard and garden are very pretty, when we visited there was an old bike out there and shrubs were overgrown, so we did not end up spending time in the yard area.

Finally, we were told the home was child friendly for our 3 year old, but that was not the case.  There were objects everywhere within her reach that were not suitable for her, which led to challenges throughout our stay.

Ultimately, the home was very expensive given we changed our plans due to a lack of space and comfort."
8035008,78285621,2016-06-06,46438793,Mano,"Rebecca is a kind, responsive, understanding person.

However, the pictures do not accurately reflect the living space. It is a very cluttered house filled with lots, and lots, and lots of knick knacks. There is a lot of cat hair all around the house and floors which was off-putting. The design aesthetic is kinda creepy. The fridge and freezer were filled with food that we had a hard time fitting out groceries. Also, the trash can in the kitchen had trash in it when we arrived. 

There are lots of signs that forbid access to lots of dishes and cups in the kitchen. The house manual was excessively long and somewhat oppressive. We never truly felt comfortable to enjoy the home because we were too afraid to violate one of the many obscure rules. 

Also, cats lurk around the premises and try wandering into the house when the front door is open even for a moment. We were also woken up my squirrels seemingly stuck inside the roof or walls. 

On top of everything, it was very expensive to stay here. It's overpriced for sure. 

Can't recommend this one. Even though Rebecca is a wonderful person with a huge heart. "
8035008,79596899,2016-06-13,9028009,Cathy,"Rebecca bent over backwards to make us feel welcome - asking if she could get any food in as she had thought we were coming straight from a transatlantic flight, hunting out DVDs and toys for my daughter and showing us around personally. There's no getting away from the fact there's a lot of furniture and ornaments on every surface, and I did feel nervous that my three-year-old might break something by accident. For a short break, it was fine though. It's a lovely quiet street and a great spot to explore Monterey and over to 17 miles drive and down to Carmel as well."
8035008,86590442,2016-07-17,65234813,Stephanie,"Beautiful eclectic home with gorgeous pieces of art and furniture. Rebecca made us feel so welcome, even leaving us eggs, veggies, and condiments because she knows it is hard to cook while traveling. The location was amazing, a short walk from the beach and Lighthouse Ave. Would definitely recommend to a friend."
8035008,87038627,2016-07-18,2350910,Lisa,"Rebecca was 10 mins late to our planned meeting time to get us access to the house.  The number she provided through the reservation confirmation was an office line and no one was reachable.  She had fresh flowers and some kids books (knowing that we were traveling with our 3 young children), which was a gesture we appreciated.  But this home is NOT KID FRIENDLY.  There is so much stuff everywhere (trinkets, crafts, candles, artisan wares, etc) and there is way more furniture in the main room than the picture on the listing shows.  It is a well-loved home but extremely crowded with her personal things.  There is no where to put anything in down in the bathroom, doors don't open all the way because of furniture behind them, the kitchen is cluttered and you can't open any windows in the house because all the window sills are lined with small objects like starfish and shells. Also the home has a very strong patchouli scent.
It is clean and location is great.  But for what ended up being $600(!) for our one night stay (with extra charge for 2 additional people and all service fees) we would have been way more comfortable in a hotel. Also, the hot tub was broken."
8035008,88448825,2016-07-24,11313125,John,Rebecca was great and really helped give us directions and recommendations. She is awesome!
8035008,89064704,2016-07-26,84570094,Archana,"BIG MISTAKE. Though Rebecca was a prompt communicator, and the home was in a walkable neighborhood, close to every interest, our stay was most inhospitable. Granted, we made a few mistakes: (1) after reading the previous negative reviews, we decided to give the place the benefit of the doubt. We should have heeded the warnings.(2) we misunderstood the 10% occupancy tax to be included in the total listed on the separate screen, which includes a line item for tax. We did end up paying it, minus $1.80. (3) our first night, we were exhausted and conked out on the sofa without putting linens on it. This is against the rules and Rebecca texted us the next day during our vacation to tell us so. Now, what we experienced for over $400/ night: During our initial walk through of the house, Rebecca spoke disparagingly of 3 previous guests, which made us uncomfortable right away. The house. Cluttered doesn't begin to describe it. There were so many layers of furniture and decoration - antique furniture and art and carpets and shells and breakable knickknacks- it was hard to negotiate a path through it. One of us bruised a knee on a table end, one of us stubbed her toe in the main room, one of us bumped her head in the bathroom. I felt like I was in the receiving area of a donation center. Dust on the furnishings. cobwebs on walls, grime on the old magazines. Mildew in bathroom. Old soap puddled in shower. Bathroom fan clogged with dust. Amenities? the bathrobes graciously provided were stained. The condiments in fridge were expired. Invited us to use the espresso machine, but could not provide 3 cups' worth coffee beans. She did later bring by a 32 oz bottle of water. The Thermostat was on 63 degrees. We asked to turn it up and she offered 64. (She did graciously offer me the use of her pashmina scarf, but I didn't wear it. wasn't going to risk a stain or a loose thread. ) No hot water in bath sink. Had to ask for bathroom tissue. No paper towels. Oppressive number of handwritten post it notes everywhere labeling what is private, what we are allowed to use. Even one on the front door to remove shoes...felt scolded before even entering the house. After our first night, Rebecca apparently went to the house while we were out, to see if we had followed her rules. That's when she texted us about the sofa and removing decorative throw pillows form the bed, and turning off the heat upon leaving. We felt watched. Overhead lights seemed to be 25 watt at most, Very hard to see. Plugged in some of the many decorative lamps. They either had no bulbs or 15 watts I guess. Dangerous spiny nails sticking out of bedroom door. Full length mirror just leaning against wall, unsecured,in cramped bedroom. Hardwood floor splintered in hallway. Splinter in barefoot. Doors could not open more than..."
8035008,91044200,2016-08-03,83983689,Terry,Rebecca was warm and friendly and took the time to show us around her home and share any necessary information as well as answer any questions we had. 
8035008,92046898,2016-08-07,36668378,Allison,"Our host, Rebecca, was courteous and accommodating making us feel welcomed in her beautiful home. She was responsive to our needs while giving us privacy. We would definitely recommend her and come back to this location in the future. "
8035008,93467071,2016-08-12,36481683,Sophia,"Rebecca is very nice and welcoming, and her house is really a warm and historic place for all kinds of travelers. She is so considerate and she gave us directions and called park in person to see whether it is still open since the wildfire might affect the area we will visit."
8035008,94004240,2016-08-14,3610844,Louise,"Quaint little cottage with eclectic decor. Super convenient location, close to everything, but in a quiet residential area. Nice hot tub."
8035008,96168003,2016-08-22,39384084,Aimee,Thank you for being so hospitable and having everything ready for us during a very busy car week! Much appreciated on all the little extras you did for us. House was cute and quaint. Thank you. 
8035008,99783486,2016-09-05,4184475,Bernadette,Rebecca was very welcoming. She arranged fresh flowers in living and dining rooms.
8035008,102599459,2016-09-18,40800316,Mark,"Rebecca was very welcoming and pleasant.  She was on time when we arrived and made the transition into her home very easy.  After meeting her upon arrival, we did not see her until we departed.  We felt that we had total privacy."
8035008,105368736,2016-10-01,95751993,Adam,Great place. Rebecca was very kind and welcoming. Cozy spot for sure!!
8035008,105995223,2016-10-03,68311919,Na,"很漂亮的房子!小巧精致,厨房用品齐全,我们甚至做了两餐中餐,在异国风情的房子里吃着中歺别有一番风味!房东非常热情!装饰品很多也很有意思!"
8035008,106895946,2016-10-08,40490257,Jim,Rebecca's advice on check in is invaluable. Talk to her about where to eat etc. This cottage is really cool. Eat at the Beach House before 5:30 for the sunset dinners. The house is located very close to the Aquarium and downtown. Awesome stay. Thanks    Rebecca. 
8035008,107501707,2016-10-10,30722878,Tanner,"L' Petite Chateau was located in a nice, quiet and quaint little neighborhood. The home almost feels like walking into an antique shop. Lot's and lots of cute little knick-knacks and decorations. Probably not a good place to bring small children as there are many small and breakable items located everywhere. But it's a nice place to be near the water and Cannery Row. "
8035008,110198232,2016-10-24,20954029,Paul,We had a lovely 4 day stay.  The house is very comfortable and the location and area are excellent. Very quiet. The aquarium is an easy walk as are shops etc in the downtown.  The host was very responsive to our needs.  Highly recommend.
8035008,111304518,2016-10-30,16918022,Tanya,"This house is in a good location.  After booking, within 24 hrs, we noticed in the listing she said she was a cat owner - I contacted her to find out if the cats lived inside, she said they were outdoor cats but had access to the house. Rebecca was responsive and made a nice effort to clean her home after we realized we would lose everything if we cancelled our reservation.   We attempted to cancel, and called Airbnb.  But due to the timing we could not cancel without losing everything and Airbnb does not answer their phones - multiple phone calls left us with over 2 hrs on hold.  So we decided to try it.  Upon arrival it was clear that cats lived in the home full time as the entire house smells strongly of cat urine.  She tried to clean but it is impossible to clean  a house that has cats living in it full time without major work.  The windows do not open and we could not attempt to air it out.  This house is very full of furniture and crowded, the twin bed in the second bedroom blocks access to the other bed. I know it would not be possible to clean this house enough to get rid of the allergens - there is too much stuff. The garden, which we relied on to be outside if our allergies bothered us was unusalbe, it was overgrown and had only one chair.  I let Rebecca know we were not going to stay and she said we should take our cat meds as her friend was able to be in the house while taking hers.  As allergy medicines are not able to handle the problems with sleeping in a house that is full of cat allergens and we could not stand the odor we chose to find other accommodations.  We stayed there for about 30 mins - and stood outside for 20 of the minutes.  Both members of the party who are allergic were itchy and experiencing sneezing, watering eyes and coughing. The third member of our party who is not allergic found this home to smell unbearably bad and refused to stay as well.  I would suggest Rebecca prominently display in the first line of her listing that cats live in her house and it is not suitable for people with allergies.  Additionally, I think AirBnb should have a prominent place to show this as well.  For people without cats it is very, very noticeable, if she continues to rent it out she should consider this or having the house and furniture professionally steam cleaned, and aired out.  I am unsure if it would be ok even then.  I wish Rebecca good luck, but this was not a place that should be rented."
8035008,113019578,2016-11-09,44314327,Nancy,"Rebecca's home is beautiful, very cozy, and extremely convenient for Asilomar/Monterey/Beach destinations. Parking was plentiful and convenient. We enjoyed our stay! "
8035008,115095433,2016-11-21,56361759,Wayne,"Rebecca was very accommodating, and great to work with. Her place was cozy, and the hot tub was a nice relaxing touch. "
8035008,115572820,2016-11-25,103384556,Letizia,"We had a great time at Rebecca's place. She was very helpful in recommending restaurants in the aerea. She also gave us a very nice tour of her place explaining in detail how to use the kitchen, jacuzzi, sauna etc. Rebecca's kitchen is just amazing and it was the best place where we could prepare and have our Thanksgiving dinner."
8035008,117082253,2016-12-04,58031720,Jackie,"Great value, close to sites, easy check in and everything you need"
8035008,120203191,2016-12-08,39466779,Jamilla,"Rebecca was very sweet and personally showed us around her home and gave us all the instructions we would need for staying there, as well as gave us good recommendations for food and activities to do. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet. The hot tub was one of the major reasons my boyfriend I chose to stay here. However, take extra caution to make sure the door is unlocked before you go out there! We unfortunately forgot to check and ended up locking ourselves on the private back deck! Thankfully, Rebecca heard our distress and came to unlock the door for us. Ha ha... The bed is really comfortable by the way. There are a lot of rules to respect, so make sure you read them all. We didn't realize there was an additional occupancy fee until we got the low down from Rebecca, so like I said, read all the rules before booking so you can be well-informed. "
8035008,123536050,2016-12-29,44798213,Felicity & Gordon,"Great last minute booking after Christmas. We arrived late and Rebecca greeted us with a plate of home made cookies before orienting us to her home. It was clean, comfortable and after turning off the hot tub, very quiet. Rebecca was very conscientious and considerate, and a friendly host."
8035008,126679900,2017-01-13,24591922,Gale,"Everything was as described. The cottage is comfortably provisioned, with an appealing and private side garden. The hot tub is a soothing extra. The cottage is convenient by a brief drive or a pleasant walk to shops and restaurants. Rebecca is a thoughtful responsive host."
8035008,132931919,2017-02-19,110519890,Arthur,Lovely place.  Very clean with beautiful furnishings and she even had some beautiful fresh cut flowers for us.  Great hot tub too. The only tiny issue for us is that the bed can be tricky for a couple since one person needs to navigate over the other to get out.  But the picture accurately shows this.   
8035008,133326485,2017-02-21,54078938,Ron,"We had a great time at Rebecca's place. Everything is very clean, labeled, and well organized. The hot tub is an excellent and relaxing bonus. Rebecca gave a great personal orientation to her home and the surrounding area for shopping and restaurants. The living room sofa is extra comfy and a great place to read or watch TV."
8035008,134309320,2017-02-26,57895758,Karen,"We had a wonderful stay at Rebecca's Air BnB. She is an amazing host, very thorough in orienting us to her home, gracious in all she supplied for us for breakfast and cooking comforts. The linens and towels were very nice. Her home is filled with beautiful family furnishings, was very clean and filled with beautiful fresh flowers. We had a little confusion with the heater and stove but Rebecca was easily available by text to resolve our questions.  She had a wealth of information about sights to visit, restaurants, walks and hikes. Her cats are wonderful too, if you happen to miss your pets while away from home. We would highly recommend L' Petite Chateau Beach Bungalow! "
8035008,139473970,2017-03-25,42927608,Andy,Great place and centrally located in Pacific Grove. Wonderful hospitality and we will return. Thank you Rebecca. 
8035008,143866471,2017-04-13,22109356,John,A creative cosy home. We enjoyed our brief stay. Our host was extremely welcoming. 
8035008,144136556,2017-04-14,125056539,Maksym,"It's comfortable nice house in very quite location. Just 3 mins drive to the downtown. Host is very friendly. No issues with check-in/check-out. Coffee, tea, towels.. everything necessary is available. Amenities are not new but everything works ok. There is old style espresso machine which makes really good espresso.
It's good place for 1-3 nights stay."
8035008,148887781,2017-05-01,20869559,Ian,Loved the place. Every creature comfort of home. Wonderful location. 
8035008,149304976,2017-05-03,16150035,Stephanie,Great little place close to everything.  Home was cozy and cute and had everything we needed

8035008,152085793,2017-05-14,14209937,Miranda,"Comfy bed, great spa tube, cozy and comfortable place. Conveniently close to town. Rebecca gave great recommendations for restaurants! "
8035008,152870022,2017-05-18,61027562,Steve,"The host is as charming as the cottage!  For those of you who have little girls and are kids at heart, this sweet Fairy Tale home is a must-stay."
8035008,153779307,2017-05-21,30226760,Shaileen,Rebecca was a very attentive hostess. The neighborhood was very quiet and felt very safe with cute little girls setting up a lemonade stand across the street. 25 cents a cup! The beds and pillows were super comfy and everything was easy. I inadvertently left my credit card and had to drive back a half hour after I left. She wasn't home but responded promptly to my text via the air B&B website and interrupted her breakfast out to come back and open the house. Thank you!
8035008,155802418,2017-05-28,33681923,Andrew,"We had a mixed experience staying at Rebecca's.  She is a pleasant and helpful host and the house is in a great location, within walking distance to nice restaurants and the beach.  It is also a very quiet location.  However, we found the house to be very cluttered.  Every room is packed with furniture and other stuff.  This reduced the functionality and our enjoyment of the space. "
8035008,157849988,2017-06-04,9033120,Cody Chance,"Rebecca is super friendly and accommodating! She provided great recommendations for dinner and even offered to make a reservation for us! Cozy and cute space with lots of character. The spa tub and sauna were a really nice perk to have, especially after our Spartan Race. "
8035008,160594541,2017-06-14,31867855,Adam,"Rebecca is extremely kind and her place is in a terrific location. That said, there were some cleanliness issues and her place is slightly more cluttered compared to the pictures. While the house is overall pleasant, for the same price, we could have afforded two nights at the hotel overlooking the beach down the road. "
8035008,161906679,2017-06-18,11654807,Ash,"While Rebecca's place was well located and generally comfortable, I can't recommend staying here unless you care to have your vacation time micromanaged by a stranger (see the overly verbose and nitpicky rules section for a flavor of the experience).

Case and point, although there were other issues as well, Rebecca entered the property unannounced after she saw me leave during the day to conduct what I can only imagine was an inspection? She then left a lengthy hand written note about all of the things my guest and I were doing wrong. Not only was this a serious invasion of privacy for her to enter the home unannounced when I had paid for a private home, but her complaints were absurd. 

She complained that I had left a light on (well within my right to do so as a customer paying for electricity), that I had left a towel over a chair instead of on the hooks in the bathroom (the towel was not wet or damaging anything), and that we had ""overused"" the hot tub (which she calls a therapy spa and says can only be used for 10 minutes at a time with no clothes...). She then proceeded to chemically treat the tub so that it could not be used for the remainder of the stay. PS This was the sole reason I booked this place and on top of that it gave me a rash.

Someone who is as particular about their things should not be renting out their space for money. I wasn't staying with a friend's mom for free; I paid (if I could underline this I would) for the use of a private space, and excessively I might add in part due to a relatively hidden 10% occupancy tax that is due in cash or check upon arrival. Within reason, provided I am not damaging anything, I should be able to use the rental as I see fit, and I should be able to do so in privacy. "
8035008,165723427,2017-07-02,66813592,Emily,"Beautiful home in a great location within walking distance to many shops and restaurants . Rebecca was very generous in giving us food for breakfast, coffee, and plenty of info about the surrounding area. Awesome to have a sauna and jacuzzi and I'd say the value of having an entire home was nice. Only downside was lots of items around the house that made it hard to fully relax, and a cat odor. We enjoyed our stay otherwise. "
8035008,171500655,2017-07-17,61729367,Karen,"Rebecca's home is absolutely charming. The location can't be beat for an easy walk to Lover's Point as well as lots of shopping and dining choices. Her collections of artwork and literature made for a unique experience inside the home, while the landscaping in the secluded outdoor spaces only added to the ambiance. Rebecca was very gracious, providing breakfast items and suggestions for attractions and dining in the area. 

My advice to anyone considering renting would be to read the extensive house rules and manual thoroughly prior to booking. Rebecca is very particular, as is her right as the owner of the space. The other suggestion would be to ask clarifying questions, (including whether the owner intends to enter the home daily during your stay) PRIOR to booking."
8035008,182053262,2017-08-13,1883745,Rudy,great place to stay in PG

Rebecca really made sure our stay was comfortable and pleasant. The property is walking distance to Restaurants, the local market, and the beach we barely made use of our car. We also loved the garden area and side yard (very charming) !

8035008,192659578,2017-09-10,28312546,Svetlana,"This property could be a real gem, but the abundance of personal items, windows that can't be opened, limited space and deferred maintenance keeps me from giving it a thumbs up rating, nor do I think it should try to accommodate more than 3 people.  I found the description of the amenities overstated, but the owner is responsive, accommodating and can provide you with lots of of local information.  You can't beat the location - close to restaurants, shops and tourist attractions.  At the end of the day, you just need to decide where you'd be most comfortable based on personal preferences."
8035008,195301950,2017-09-18,132529242,Laurel,"This is a very nice little house in a great location. You can walk to nice restaurants, to the beach, to parks. We really loved the location. The inside is clean, although a bit cluttered in its decorative style. I loved the bed, found it really comfortable and woke with no aches or pains at all. For my husband, it was a little too soft. The best part was the hot tub, which we loved, and the sauna, which I expected to use more but it was small.

Rebecca herself is very kind and thoughtful, even gifted us a bottle of very good organic wine as she remembered we were there for our anniversary. I very much appreciated that she doesn't use artificial air fresheners in her house, as I am allergic to many of them. Yet her house was clean and smelled good, naturally.

The only small downside was that Rebecca lives in the house when not airbnb'ing it and in a cottage in back when house is rented. Her presence is very much in the house whether she is there or not, so it is more like being a guest in someone else's home than other airbnb's I have experienced."
8035008,197135612,2017-09-24,7611753,Kristine,"We stayed at this quaint little home for a weekend visit to Monterey Bay specifically to visit the aquarium. We are a family of 3 (couple + our 8 month old son) and found the home a good size and location for us since we were out and about most of the day. It's very walkable to restaurants, parks, and the ocean in Pacific Grove, and a nice outing walk (~25 min) or 5 min drive to the aquarium.
Please be sure to read the house rules prior to booking to ensure you do not have any problems with the restrictions. 
We notified the host prior to our arrival that we needed room for the baby's pack & play and she moved some furniture around to accommodate this, had sheets on the guest bed in the second room to use as a changing area, and had children plates/cups available for use- definitely a nice set up for traveling with baby!
I would say this place is ideal for either a couple traveling together or a family of 3-4 (second bedroom has ability to sleep 2 but on separate beds/pull out) but not if you have crawling/toddling kids due to the presence of a lot of antique/breakable furniture and decor in the home.
Rebecca was a great host- communicated well with us before and during the visit, had some fresh fruit and tea available for the morning, and gave suggestions of family friendly places to visit and eat."
8035008,199388690,2017-10-01,37066040,Aaron,Great location and extremely easy to work with Rebecca. House was very cluttered
8035008,202092758,2017-10-09,151280307,Kenneth,"If you plan to rent this home I would strongly suggest to read the description and reviews thoroughly. The rental was beyond cluttered and left no space to put clothes and/or personal belongings. My family and I (3 adults) had no room to unpack anything from our suitcases. The house had a strange odor, which seemed to be the straw that broke the camel's back on this rental.
Once we checked in we all took a shower and realized that we could not stay here for the rest of the weekend. I decided it was a better idea to pay for a hotel than stay in this rental. In conclusion, we stayed for 45 minutes and ate the entire cost of the weekend plus paid for a hotel.
I will say that Rebecca was extremely responsive and easy to get a hold of.
Hopefully no one has the same experience that I did."
8035008,205031785,2017-10-20,27014683,Patti,Good location
8035008,206106334,2017-10-23,34231097,Happy Camper,"Rebecca is very accurate in her description of the cottage being her home and you are a guest.   She has a lovely cottage that is full of her many belongings.   That being said, the amount of personal items in the cottage was really unexpected.  The house is  full of her things leaving very little free surface area to unpack.  I was hoping to cook more but again surface space was limited.  The oven was full of heavy cooking dishes/pans which had to be placed on the stove-top when in use which meant that we couldn't use the range when baking.  The master bedroom had little to no space to unpack and we ended up leaving our bags in the living room.  My expectation was that we could make this our home for our 3 day visit with our daughter and that was hard to do in this environment.

That being said, if you don't have a lot of stuff, Rebecca's things are beautiful, the garden is really sweet, I love the hot tub and the location can't be beat."
8035008,206728102,2017-10-26,148580354,Colleen,"Location is convenient to restaurants, etc. There is an over-abundance of personal items resulting in crowded rooms. Read the rules which are overly restrictive and not designed with guest's comfort in mind. The host is friendly and helpful though very protective of her personal residence. Can't recommend it to others."
8035008,228974809,2018-01-21,45466888,Amy,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8035008,247520482,2018-03-28,28419199,Mel,"We had a terrible experience staying here due to Rebecca's demeanor and the space. The house is very cluttered and there are items in every corner possible. We felt claustrophobic and weary while navigating the area. There are also sticky notes all over the house telling you what to do. In regards to her demeanor, she was very anxious and stated many, many rules. Additionally, she made sexist comments alluding to the fact that men and women have different tastes and preferences and that I would be ""attacked"" by the guys I was with. 
Rebecca accused us of stealing items, drinking her bottle of vodka, and using outdoor facilities inappropriately. These are all things we did not do. We are a group of responsible graduate students from Stanford and find these accusations absurd. Save yourself a headache and don't book this house. Also, there isn't coffee in the house."
8104325,46071878,2015-09-07,3883437,Alex,"I've stayed at dozens of airbnbs, but Kristy's hospitality outmatches any of my former experiences. She was communicative and attentive before our arrival, and went above and beyond providing for us at the house itself (including a gluten-free muffins to accommodate my GF wife and son)! She waited for us to arrive to show us around the house, and provided us with a really informed welcome packet including everything from tips to recommendations. I truly cannot say enough as to Kristy and Ed's hospitality. 

The house itself is immaculate: a lovely little beach cottage 2 blocks from Asilomar State Reserve. Each bedroom has a king size bed, all shampoo/conditioner provided, cooking needs met, etc. By far the most put together home I've stayed at ever. It was turn-key. The home is also perfectly located. You could walk to Pacific Grove town (it's under a mile) or hop in the car and be there in 3 minutes. The peninsula surrounding the home is stunning.

While I've stayed at many airbnbs, this is the first I can say with 100% certainty we will be booking again and soon. Thanks for a tremendous stay, Kristy and Ed!"
8104325,47797771,2015-09-21,9952779,Julian,My group of 7 coworkers had a brief but wonderful stay at Kristy & Ed's beautiful and clean home. We were in town for a fundraiser event and needed a place to stay. Many of my coworkers were new to airbnb and were stunned by the charm of the property and the little details Kristy and Ed included in their home to make us comfortable and welcomed. They were kind enough to leave out homemade cookies and snacks and had a beautifully decorated house. Everything exceeded our expectations and we highly recommend this place to any group visiting the area. We already want to go back! 
8104325,48569499,2015-09-27,4175283,Hamza,"Perfect location, and very nice home. Thank you for all the special touches like leaving a little fruit in fridge. Beds were super soft and made us reluctant to get up LOL."

I have stayed at a zillion vacation rental homes, but I have never stayed at a rental home that was as well equipped, stocked and above board welcoming than this home!!!  Kristy and Ed have outdone themselves with this gorgeous beach cottage. It is beautifully decorated with a beach/sea theme and comes so well stocked that you do not need to bring anything.  Big bottles of shampoo/conditioner and body wash were available in the showers and it was the good stuff, not the cheap hotel samples.  The bath towels were so soft and fluffy.  Kristy and Ed welcomed us with a tray of cheese and crackers, a platter of grapes and a bottle of wine. We brought our lil' Westie, Winston, and there were dog beds and pet feeding stations available plus the backyard was securely fenced. The house has gorgeous decor with big screen tv and high speed wi-fi. The neighborhood is a small cul-de-sac, but at one pint we had 3 cars and there was plenty of parking. We were in Pacific Grove for a wedding so we did not hang out much in the house, but I would love to go back and just take some r&r moments and hide away at Kristy and Ed's beach cottage. THANK YOU for sharing it with us!

8104325,50309890,2015-10-11,42603683,Anne,"My husband, daughter, her boyfriend and I spent two nights at Kristy and Ed's lovely cottage. The home was very clean,  nicely decorated and had very comfortable king beds. There was a large table for outside eating as well as space for Bocce ball! The home is in walking distance to the beach and the Monarch Sanctuary. The owners provided detailed information about the house and things to do in the area. We had a nice welcome waiting for us. We definitely would come back to this place. We had a wonderful stay."
8104325,51150979,2015-10-18,43546918,Sreedevi,"We had a fabulous vacation at Kristy's lovely home ! Very clean , spacious  home with all amenities and King beds in all 3 bedrooms was a huge plus. Nice neighborhood and is 10 mts walking distance to beach . 
Kristy was an amazing hostess . Very prompt and clear in her communications . She had left us wine , cheese , fruits as welcome treats and toys for our children to play with which was a huge hit ! 
I would highly recommend Kristy& Ed's place to anyone who loves a clean spacious home within walking distance to beach and a perfect hostess. 
Thanks Kristy ! "
8104325,53464267,2015-11-09,42123570,Carolyn,"Our hosts were gracious and extremely responsive.  Everything was exactly, no, better than we thought it would be.  Kristy and Ed made sure that we were welcome in their home, which was beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable.  
The neighborhood was quaint and quiet.  We only wish would could have stayed longer."

They have even thought of a million special touches to make guests feel welcome and comfortable.  My husband and I, my parents and my toddler had an amazing holiday thanks to this accommodation.  I can't wait to go back!"
8104325,57292907,2015-12-24,10440617,Mihir,"Kristy and Ed's place was a really comfortable and very well laid out and welcoming for our whole family. When we got there the weather was really cold and the lovely fireplace was so very nice! The youngsters in our group also loved the xfinity system for the wide selection of movies!

As we were traveling with our elderly parents and our college age kids we needed a place that provided comfort, space and relaxation for all of us. Kristy and Ed's place hit the spot on all those accounts. The place was super clean, and exactly as in the pictures and appears fresh and renovated. All appliances were top end quality as you would have in your own home. As we were on a long trip, we appreciated the use of the washer/dryers! Kristy and Ed were responsive to all our queries and were prompt in suggesting how to fix minor issues like how to light the fireplace. While staying at the place we noticed a field mouse that must have found its way into the garage. Kristy and Ed made sure the local animal control dept was contacted and arrangements made to ensure we were not inconvenienced in any way and even went the extent to give us a $200 refund! We really appreciated the attention to ensuring our comfort and the service mentality they had!  We also appreciated the aquarium passes and the tips on local restaurants given our parents were vegetarian!  The best part of the place is that it is a five minute walk to the beach front and was really nice for walks with the entire family. If you want to be close to the water and be walking distance, this is the place to be.  Thank you guys we will certainly come back!"
8104325,58273589,2016-01-02,43003290,Barbara,"Hi there! We arrived back in Pasadena last night after dropping the kids at SFO then heading back south. We all want to thank you for sharing your peaceful and beautiful home with us. We were feeling so lucky to be just sitting in the secluded backyard reading in the sun, or awakening one by one to converge over breakfast and coffee, or making our way to sunset and whale spouts. Comfort and attention to detail.. You've created a wonderful accommodation.

Thanks! All the best in the New Year!

8104325,59687460,2016-01-14,26558505,Spencer,"Wow! That's all I can say. This was easily one of my top AirBnB experience so far. The home was even better than described. It was clear that Kristy and Ed have spared now expense in setting up this house. Beds and linens were top notch, as were furnishings and appliances throughout. We had absolutely everything we needed, including some wonderful snacks upon arrival. The location was also perfect. We were attending a conference at nearby Asilomar and were very pleased with the proximity of the home to Asilomar and town. 

Access to the home was easy and convenient. We didn't have the chance to meet Kristy and Ed in person, but they were very kind in their correspondence and quick to respond to any needs or questions that came up before and during our trip. 

Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our trip. Worlds better than any hotel experience you could have in the area. "
8104325,60380021,2016-01-23,1471378,Sarah,"Kristy made our group feel welcomed from the start with easy communication and follow-up until our visit.  The house is really comfortable, with great beds in each room. Everything we needed for the stay was available, plus some wonderful and appreciated little extras. :) Thanks Kristy and Ed! We'd love to stay at your place again next time we visit Pacific Grove. "

I want to say this Kristy's house is awesome and so professional!! I can recommend this lovely home to anybody wants to stay at Monterey area.  There are lots of parking spaces, so many towels, shampoo/conditioner, all kitchen appliances, cable tvs, bbq grills and so forth. 
Our family can give 5 stars out if 5!! "
8104325,62333594,2016-02-14,13199777,Cathie,"We had a great time!  Five of us came for AT&T golf tournament and the place was perfect.  Comfy King beds in all three bedrooms, and the house had everything we could possibly need.  We were there three nights, but could have stayed much longer without any complaints.  House is in a quiet residential neighborhood, close to beach and with good walking paths.  Beautifully put together with nice homey touches and neat and clean as could be.  Our only regret is that we didn't have long enough to enjoy the back patio or a dinner at home.  Otherwise, we were totally comfortable and at home.  We want to return for a much longer stay!"
8104325,62798459,2016-02-17,41771236,Megan,This place was fabulous! It looked exactly like the photos and was a great spot for a family getaway of 6 adults (and a dog). Kristy was very accommodating and even left us a treat upon our arrival! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing beach vacation.
8104325,63182630,2016-02-21,12426226,Michelle,"We had the greatest weekend staying at ed and kristy's place! The house was just the right size, nicely furnished and had all the amenities for our group of 6 and two infants.  Kristy was great at communicating with us leading up to our visit letting us know what expect.  The house is in the perfect location allowing for easy access to monterey, Carmel and a short walk to the seaside at asilomar. We enjoyed playing bocce ball in the backyard and taking in the sunshine. The house is fully stocked with linens, blankets, board games and kitchen basics. I don't think we would have changed a thing.  We are already talking about the next time we should do this. Thank you for such a great time and good memories."
8104325,65943919,2016-03-18,5849600,Brigitte,"Kristy and Ed are the perfect hosts.  We received timely communications in the days leading up to our arrival.  We then found a bottle of wine and some St Patrick's Day treats up on our arrival at the exquisitely appointed vacation home.  The place was ideal for our 5-person staff retreat.  The kitchen had every utensil we needed, the beds were super comfy, the sheets and towels were of luxurious quality, and the whole house was in tip top shape.  "

The decor of the house is super cute and the beds were very comfortable. The kitchen had everything you would want to cook up a nice meal. The location was also great for checking out the Central California Coast, close to Monterey, Pebble Beach, Carmel and Big Sur. Pacific Grove is an adorable town with lots of cute shops and restaurants. My family really enjoyed our stay. Our best Airbnb experience so far. "

Kristy and Ed are such thoughtful and accommodating hosts and we very much appreciated their kindness and lovely home!  We look forward to our next visit and will definitely stay here again!!!
Thank you!!!!"

Im so glad we were able to book this very popular house out house though Air BnB.  Im very picky on the places I stay and I would definitely re-book this place in the future.  The beds were so comfortable and everything was organized and CLEAN. They have done a lot of work to their home and it shows :)  It was a quick walk down to the beach. Kristy and Ed provided a book full of fun tips to do in Monterey. Places to eat, grab a cocktail, sits to visit.  We are so glad to have been able to stay in your home and fully enjoy our vacation to California.  Our family gives this place a 5 out 5 stars :)"
8104325,69210206,2016-04-10,1415332,Sean,"Great Hosts / Great Place!   
The house is great if you have 1-2 young kids.  They have toys (which were a godsend), and there's a room toward the back that the kids can sleep in which is more separate from the house, so if they wake up they won't bother everyone as much.   Also great location - walking distance to Asilomar Beach tide pools.  Hosts were very responsive and helpful!"
8104325,69790189,2016-04-13,1304148,Amy,"This was my very first time using airbnb and my experience was outstanding. Here's why:

-The space was exceptionally comfortable. I was traveling with my parents and two young children, Traveling with young children is never easy, yet this house made it significantly easier! The layout allowed my parents to stay on one end of the house with their own bathroom and bedroom. The kids and I utilized the two bedrooms and bathroom on the other end of the house. There was ample privacy, yet an inviting community space to visit. The backyard space was perfect for the kids to safely play. Also, there was a pack-n-play in each bedroom.

-The service was top-notch! Kristy contacted me in advance to see if I wanted her to leave out a high chair and Thomas Trains. When we arrived there were coloring books and other goodies. I found her communication to be responsive and friendly!

I would love to stay here again! I can't believe that my first experience with airbnb was so positive!

Thanks for a great vacation!

The location and house were beautiful but our host went the extra mile with a tray of cheese, crackers, and strawberries, along with a bottle of wine, upon our arrival. It was a welcome site after the heavy traffic driving from SF. The beds, comforters, and towels were similar to a 5 star resort and the kitchen and bathrooms  were fully stocked with everything we needed and more. She thought of everything, including make-up remover towelettes that my daughter forgot. I highly recommend this place to anyone. "

From the quality of beds, bed linens and towels to the excellence in house decor and kitchenware. We were travelling with children and toddlers and Kristy provided new pak and plays with comfy mattresses, left toys, books, paints and snacks for the kiddies, as well as a welcome cheese and wine for the adults. :) The house was spacious yet cozy, with the backyard perfect for relaxing and for kids to play safely. We used the 2 guest aquarium passes provided and had a great day, thank you! Kristy was always very responsive and went above and beyond when we needed help with our little sick one.

There is everything you need (and more) for your stay.  I was really impressed with how well-stocked the kitchen is.  A lot of work has gone into making this a home to call home while you are away.  The neighbourhood is very quiet and only a short stroll away from a beautiful coastal walk . It is in within easy driving distance from downtown Pacific Grove/Monterey.
Kristy kept in touch with us both before and during our stay to let us  know to contact her if we needed anything, and responded quickly to any questions.  There was a gift of wine, cheese, crackers, etc. waiting for us when we arrived.  Thank you!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to stay here again!"

Our group consisting of six adults and one baby loved staying at this house. Everything we needed was provided, from a closet full of towels to charcoal for the barbecue grill, to glass tupperware containers, fancy pots and pans, detergent, all sorts of toiletries, board games, high chair and wooden train set for the baby. The only thing missing are clothes, but of course, you provide that yourself. =)

Pros
-clean and spotless, meticulously maintained property
-quick and friendly communication from the owner
-Safeway and Trader Joes located nearby
-quiet and friendly neighborhood
-ocean and beach are a quick 5 minute walk
-two Monterey Bay Aquarium guest passes provided, such a treat!

Cons
-the mattress was a tad too soft for me

Gorgeous House!
I love everything in this house. I had such a nice and comfortable time during stay. I felt at home and didn't miss my home my bed at all. Kristy let us use everything in the house and of course, they are nice stuffs. She reply promptly and very helpful when we asked for early check in or late check out. She is very kind and helpful. We couldn't ask for more!
Thanks again and again!!

Starting with the prompt and easy communication through to the booklet in the house explaining all the procedures in detail, it was a lovely home and relaxing stay.  The house is in a very quiet neighborhood and was impeccably clean when we arrived to find a welcoming basket of snacks and such- the kids were super happy about that!.  The beds are comfortable, and the pillows were plentiful and linens were all top notch.  The kitchen was well stocked and organized to make preparing meals easy. The bathroom had shampoo and conditioner and such available, there were games to play in the evenings and beach towels available for going to the shore. There was plenty of seating for our family of five both in the living room and around the table. The backyard made a perfect place to sit an enjoy a glass of wine in the evenings while the kids played bocce.  It was a nice, easy walk of 10 minutes or so down to the most beautiful rocky beaches of Asilomar. We have already decided we would love to return ---many thanks Kristy and Ed!"

The home was not only well-maintained and decorated, but also very comfortable and well-stocked for our stay.  Usually, vacation rental properties tend to fall short when it comes to beds, but that is certainly NOT the case here.   Not only were there 3 king size beds, but they were comfortable, quality beds.   This is something that is much appreciated after long days hiking and/or shopping.  We were fortunate enough to meet our host (Kristy) and were very appreciative of the welcoming gifts that were left for us to enjoy during our stay.   As a frequent vacation home renter, I would highly recommend this property.   A real gem!"

We were particularly touched at your thoughtfulness in providing the toy trains for my son, who spent hours playing with them.

I highly recommend their house for future visitors. The kitchen was delightful for cooking foodies. The beds were cozy and comfortable. The backyard was welcoming and relaxing. It was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the surrounding spenders of Monterey.

Kristy's Coastal Getaway is exactly what is promised and more. The home is set-up with everything we needed and fit our family perfectly. Kristy has thought of literally everything. I can not think of how to exactly exclaim my happiness for this property, the owner and the amenities. We were thrilled with our stay and want to come back soon and often!"
8104325,97557737,2016-08-27,75452912,Joanna,"We had a fantastic experience! The home worked perfectly for our two families, including 3 kids under the age of 4! Kristy and Ed provided everything we needed, including a high chair, toys and a pack n play. The home was immaculate and there was plenty of everything - towels, kitchen supplies like pots and pans and even toiletries in the bathrooms! They truly have thought of everything that would make this space accommodating and convenient for renters. Kristy was very prompt in responding if we had any questions regarding the house and was such a gracious host. Highly recommend! "
8104325,101440888,2016-09-13,2432978,German,"La casa es genial, dos amplios dormitorios, con camas king y sabanas muy buenas, otro mas pequeño pero también con cama King, el barrio muy tranquilo y accesible a todas las atracciones ya sea en automóvil o caminando. La cocina equipada full, el jardín trasero con barbacoa pequeña pero suficiente para nosotros. Toda la casa ambientada con buen gusto, la chimenea funciona a gas perfectamente. Todo sinceramente genial, nos quedamos 7 días, ojala hubieran sido mas. Esperemos volver pronto, muy recomendable!"
8104325,103674362,2016-09-23,27361931,Emily,"Kristy and Ed's house is a special place. They have created a peaceful and relaxing space that is well equipped and comfortable. Communication was easy, and Kristy was kind and very accommodating. The house is located close to the Main Street and the beach which made it a perfect location. The house is laid out well. Kristy left toys out for our kids and goodies upon arrival. Overall, you could tell that Kristy and Ed not only take pride in their place but also in ensuring their guests feel well taken care of and welcome. If you are wondering whether to book, do it! You won't be sorry! "
8104325,109952630,2016-10-23,84489849,Maaja,"Kristy and Ed's house was perfect for us and our three kids. After staying in a cramped hotel room in San Fran, this house and the three king sized beds were a treat. So comfortable!  Everything was lovely including the welcoming treats Kristy left out, the high quality towels and bedding, and the bocce ball that our boys enjoyed. I have family in the area and there was plenty of room to host the four of them for dinner. We had everything we needed (besides groceries)  to serve some chili, warm bread and a nice salad.  It is a nice walk, or a very quick drive, to town. Thank you for your attention to detail!  We would gladly come back to enjoy this house!

8104325,113139442,2016-11-10,11923421,Stefán,Beautiful house with great comfort and lots of small perks and details that are really thoughtful. Kristy responds very quickly to all messages and we couldn't recommend them more.
8104325,115741344,2016-11-26,75275319,Heidi,Wonderful home.  Clean and updated and a 5 minute walk to Asilomar State Park!   Kristy and Ed went out of their way to welcome us.

8104325,123121057,2016-12-27,3677108,Charles & Cheryl,"Kristy and Ed's home and welcome was absolutely wonderful.  The house is a short few blocks to gorgeous Asilomar Beach Park, and our adult kids often walked the mile or so to downtown Pacific Grove for coffee shop time.  Lovely furnishings, comfortable beds, and a welcome basket of wine and assorted yummy foods made for a great stay.  And thanks to them, our family is now addicted to backyard bocce!  They were quickly responsive to any questions, and have created a home away from home for visitors - a superb stay!"
8104325,123843894,2016-12-30,15413232,Raquel,The best place we stayed so far.

8104325,130384817,2017-02-05,1427083,David,"Such an absolutely marvelous place to stay! We've never been so well provided for in an airbnb -- the house was beautiful and spacious, the backyard was gorgeous and inviting, the neighborhood (and quick walk to the ocean) was lovely, and the amenities were fantastic. The kitchen was incredibly well stocked for cooking meals, the beds were soft and cozy, and Kristy was responsive and helpful in all aspects (including mailing back a beloved stuffed animal that got left behind). Very, very highly recommended! "

8104325,134542015,2017-02-27,23784580,Deborah,"What a perfect house! The house was well-equipped, from the fully stocked kitchen to bathrooms with ample towels. The house was roomy for our group of 5 and the floor plan of the house perfect - the separate bedroom and bathroom away from the other rooms is ideal for groups with different sleep schedules. All bedrooms have king beds which are VERY comfortable. Kristy provided us with a lovely basket of snacks and a bottle of local wine upon our arrival. She responded quickly to questions about local dining spots and activities. The house information book was detailed and contained useful information. The location of the house affords easy access to the beach, Carmel, and Monterey. Nearby Asilomar beach is great for kids with tide pools to explore and calm waves. You won't regret a stay in this house!"
8104325,140068067,2017-03-27,20865223,Bill,"Kristy and Ed's place is excellent. A great location close to the beach and minutes to the quaint downtown. Immaculate and well provisioned with cooking equipment and spices etc. The backyard is a great place to unwind and have a glass of wine. Beds were super comfortable and the décor was very nice. Its a great base to hike at Point Lobos, play golf or explore Monterey. Highly recommended.  "
8104325,141354076,2017-04-02,118214461,Elizabeth,Kristy was a pleasure to communicate with - very responsive and friendly.

Highly recommended!
8104325,142318451,2017-04-07,107943445,Joyce,"The place was small but the space was used so well.  The kitchen was well appointed.  I brought several things in case, but didn't need them. Backyard was great.  Walked to the beach every day, just 3 blocks away.  Kristy was always responsive and available.  Dogs loved the beach walks and the backyard.  We all loved this house!"

They have thought of everything and spared nothing in making Coastal Cottage a  comfortable, enjoyable, and homey place to stay! This is the second time we have stayed here, the location is great and we can't wait to return! "

Kristy and Ed have been very thorough and thoughtful when furnishing and outfitting their home.  Every need their guests might need is there and available.  It's as if you left home to go on vacation, but end up at a warm and inviting home to have your vacation.  Kitchen is well appointed with all you need to have a family meal.

8104325,150312357,2017-05-07,119139276,Kathann,Beautiful home. Perfect in every way! 
8104325,153264434,2017-05-20,13408203,Regina,"Excellent choice! Kristy and Ed where the perfect hosts. Their listing is accurate and the home is cozy, clean and comfortable. There were 4 of us adults and we had plenty of space to relax and enjoy our stay. The home is fully furnished. We only had to purchase the food we needed (when not enjoying one of the many restaurants in the area). This was a great vacation! We even took the 3hr ride to the Hearst Castle, which is a must do! Thanks Kristy and Ed for sharing your home with us and providing tips on where we should visit as well as 2 passes to the Aquarium, which we thoroughly enjoyed!"
8104325,156697585,2017-05-31,80478562,Matthew,Just perfect. Kristy and Ed's place was pristine and well stocked for our visit. They communicated well for check-in and had a lovely gift basket waiting for us in the fridge. Our family couldn't have had a better time!
8104325,174323157,2017-07-25,39871744,Kelly,"As many of the other reviews demonstrate, Kristy and Ed have a lovely home that we were privileged to use.  My husband and I stayed with our 16-year old son (and 5 year old Bulldog) for an extended trip away from Minnesota.  I was a little nervous the pictures wouldn't do the place justice, but everything you see on line is accurate and even better in person.

This house was perfect.  The kitchen was well appointed and the bedding was sooooo comfortable.  The kitchen was very nice and had everything we needed, we cooked quite a bit and between the gas stove/oven and the small grill outside we didn't have to worry about a thing.

The house is 3 blocks from the ocean and we walked almost daily.  The house is also about a mile from the main shops in Pacific Grove, so easy to walk to.  We enjoyed the small Farmer's Market on Mondays.  It is also walking distance to Lover's Point beach and the path to Monterey.  We were thankful that Kristy and Ed left their guest passes to the Aquarium, it was easy to go multiple times for a couple hours right when they opened to avoid the crowds and see everything.

We highly recommend Kristy and Ed's place.  Great space, great location and great hosts."
8104325,178470879,2017-08-05,11185133,Roberta,"Beautiful, quiet, comfortable, well appointed home.  Gorgeous gardens too.  Walkable to Asilomar State Beach and Marine Reserve.  Walkable to Pacific Grove shops and restaurants"
8104325,181862644,2017-08-13,64369559,Jessica,"We had a wonderful stay. This house was beautiful and equipped with everything we needed and more. It was the perfect set up for me, my husband, 6 year old, 3 year old, and mom.

When we arrived we got to enjoy yummy treats (and wine) that they left in the fridge for us. Our girls loved the thoughtful coloring books they put out for them and their train set and children's books. We also really appreciated them leaving their aquarium passes for us to use. We enjoyed biking to pacific grove and asilomar beach and hanging out in their back yard.

We hope to return next year and highly recommend this house."
8104325,185543235,2017-08-22,80921343,Daniel,"Very nice home. As good as advertised. Very clean. Good location. Would stay there again, for sure."
8104325,190127129,2017-09-03,54633796,Winnie,Great family vacation home. Had a basket of yummies waiting for us upon arrival after a long day of traveling - we devoured it! Had stuff for the kids to play with (4 and 6 years olds) which came in handy. Kitchen well provisioned and we cooked several meals there. Would highly recommend!
8104325,191233446,2017-09-06,537723,Michael,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kristy and Ed's place.  Pleasantly surprised at the amenities for a preschooler, like toys, books, the bocce ball court, and even the height of the toilets!  Location is ideal and close to beaches, restaurants, etc but also very quiet at night."
8104325,201618751,2017-10-08,48971382,Elise,"Kristy and Ed are wonderful hosts! Their communication was excellent and they made sure we were taken care of. Their house is in a quiet cul-de-sac but close to the beach and shops. The beds were so comfortable and everything was very clean. I loved being able to do laundry (a must if you have kids) and not bring home suitcases full of sand! We also cooked dinner most nights and found the kitchen to meet all of our needs. It was nice to have the comforts of a house on this vacation, and Ed and Kristy really put a lot of thought into making their house extra comfortable."
8104325,205011458,2017-10-20,19711657,Michelle,"Peaceful location, lots of extra individual touches catered to your specific stay, spacious home beautifully decorated, fantastic beds, pet friendly with prior ok, close to the coast, downtown, restaurants, golf courses and the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary, just to name a few. Free passes to the aquarium too. Awesome backyard with relaxing seating and eating areas and a two person glider swing on the front porch. Large tv in the living room the men love!  Beautiful kitchen fully equipped.  Large basket of snacks upon arrival and even a chilled bottle of wine. Excellent quick wifi too. Very awesome hosts/owners. Cannot wait to spend another week in this home. Til then, I will be dreaming of our return."
8104325,206973692,2017-10-27,91551457,Jayne,"This cottage in Pacific Grove was perfect for our stay.  It had everything we needed and many other things we never expected to find but enjoyed.  The kitchen and bathrooms are well equipped and the whole house was clean and tidy.  It was a great location; a quiet street, great for walking and biking to the beach or nearby shops and restaurants.   Kristy and Ed have gone above and beyond to make the cottage inviting and comfortable.  We would love to stay there again."
8104325,211688804,2017-11-13,71528186,Jeff,"Fantastic place to stay. Six of us stayed for three nights and had plenty of room and were very comfortable. Great layout, great location and exceptional hosts. Walking distance from the beach. Will absolutely return. Plenty of space inside and outside. Very private backyard. 100% satisfaction!"
8104325,215804547,2017-12-01,19793358,Whitney,"This was the best rental we've ever had!!!! It waa a great location, very close to the aquarium and the beach. The beds were comfy. Best of all there was this amazing train set. It was so great we had trouble getting my son to leave the house. The hosts are clearly thoughtful people, everything was perfect!"
8104325,221487963,2017-12-26,12932555,James,"
The perfect home to spend our family Christmas holiday! Would give this home more than 5 stars if I could. We had 6 adults and were very comfortable with sleeping, sitting and dinning. Kristy and Ed's home is the most well equipped home we have ever stayed in. We were able to cook a roasted turkey holiday meal with all the trimmings without lacking any kitchen tools. All the other extras are too numerous to mention in this review. They even put some holiday decorations inside and out which certainly added to our holiday cheer. They are very responsive to all communications. The home is in a very quiet small neighborhood and a 5 minute walk to the coast. Highly recommended."
8104325,223770046,2018-01-01,122740696,Nickalee,"Coastal Getaway was a charming cottage with just about everything we ended up needing already there. Many breakfast places nearby, the Aquarium was just 8 minutes away and beautiful Asilomar Beach only a 5 minute drive. Any questions we had were promptly answered."
8104325,229054329,2018-01-21,167843965,Kenneth,"The home setup is well thought out for guests whom will be enjoying PG and Monterrey.  PG retains the old town coastal cottage charm and this home is right on the edge of downtown but still near enough to the shore to hear the surf.  Walkers or trail bikers will be pleased with immediate access to trails, the short distance to tidal pools and beach, and low density traffic streets in this area.  Passes to the ""Worlds Best"" Aquarium are a very nice touch!"
8104325,230962226,2018-01-29,38854198,Jeff,"Charming house, fabulous big beds, perfect location, wonderful hosts. What more could you ask? Thanks, Kristy and Ed. "
8104325,237120500,2018-02-21,170794625,Margaret,"We enjoy our stay so much.  Perfect for two kids and a dog.  There were lots of toys and a fenced in back yard.  We were close to the beach, restaurants, and shopping.  The house is very comfortable."
8104325,239421700,2018-03-01,130742619,Don And Ardi,"The responsiveness every step of the way!
The extra thoughtful touches! 
Great hosts and a great home/location!
Will be returning for sure."
8104325,244515702,2018-03-18,62705102,Christine,"A lovely family friendly home base with comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen and thoughtful hosts. They made traveling with children easy with so many considerate details.
We enjoyed the easy few blocks walk to the ocean and close proximity (a quick drive or a 30 minute scenic walk) to the aquarium and other in town destinations."
8104325,248120590,2018-03-30,22825999,Lloyd,"The home is amazingly clean, comfortable and a perfect location to enjoy the stunning coastline scenery of Asilomar State Beach. They welcomed our family with delicious snacks in the refrigerator and a wonderful train set for my son to build his imagination with his cousin. 

The beds were incredibly soft and we slept like we were at home. We enjoyed the quiet back yard for reading books and soaking up some sunshine. On our last night we got to do some amazing star gazing with an almost full moon. 

If you love nature and the ocean and a lovely getaway for your family...this is the perfect spot!"
9012578,53291206,2015-11-07,2403193,Anisha,"We had a very comfortable stay at Barry's. The space was nice and had everything we needed, not to mention a great location. We were right by the beach, close to the aquarium, ect. I highly recommend and can't wait to come back."
9012578,53631059,2015-11-10,26820040,Nora,"Location, location, location. Barry's place is walking distance to lots of great amenities. We walked to coffee shops, a bookstore, a lighthouse, and of course the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see the ocean as soon as you step outside the front door. Inside, the space was clean and tidy. There were space heaters in the living room and bedroom for the cold evenings. "
9012578,53908502,2015-11-14,26701619,Victor,"Overall, the house is great and I would highly recommend this place for 2-3 people. Lots of windows for natural light in the mornings and afternoons. Location was perfect as it was close [driving] to Monterrey Bay, Cannery Row, Pebble Beach, 17-Mile Dr, and Carmel-by-the-Sea. Neighborhood seemed safe, easily walkable. Ocean View Blvd and Monterey Bay Coastal [walk/bike] Trail are 1 block away, perfect for a morning or afternoon walk. Patio furnished with a table and chairs. No problems with finding parking near the house. Safeway, Trader Joe's, and CVS are close by. Cable and wifi worked well. Kitchen (with coffee maker, gas stove and microwave) was well stocked with plates, mugs, and glasses. I would highly recommend this house. "
9012578,54154134,2015-11-16,31313959,Katrina,Beautiful and charming home with a great location and lovely amenities. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back! 
9012578,54749189,2015-11-23,1881412,Ali,"We had a marvelous time. The location really can't be beat. We walked both to the aquarium and the restaurants of downtown Pacific Grove. The neighborhood is very cute and felt safe. Plenty of street parking available. The sounds of the ocean and seagulls filled the air. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare daily breakfast and lunch. The TV was modern with cable and was great to use the ""smart"" feature and link to netflix. There were plenty of towels, nice water pressure, lots of extra blankets and pillows, a comfortable couch and nice dining nook with a little peek at the ocean from one of the seats. One of my favorite features was the back patio, which got great sun in the morning and was great to relax and have some coffee. All in all, it was a fantastic stay. They were great hosts!"
9012578,54953588,2015-11-25,49508357,Kevin,John was incredibly welcoming and helpful. The location was a block away from the beach and lovers point and a short walk to the shops and restaurants in pacific grove and cannery row in Monterrey. He provided everything that we needed in a very clean and comfortable space. I would definitely recommend staying here and I will try to  book this place again when I'm in the area
9012578,55227596,2015-11-29,39298844,Chloe,"The description on the listing page was 100% accurate, and Barry answered questions promptly. Barry and his wife Corazon welcomed us warmly and showed us the house. The cabin was very clean, comfortable and perfect for our needs.

I highly recommend this place!"
9012578,55451638,2015-12-01,36875817,Keri,"John and Corazon’s house was perfect for our stay!  We had 3 people and the pull-out futon was comfortable for the 2-night stay and plenty of extra blankets were available.  The home looks just like pictures shown in the listing and was very clean and cozy!  The location is amazing - a quick walk to an incredible coastline view, walking distance to PG spots and a quick drive to the Monterey Cannary Row area and beautiful 17-mile drive.  You can enjoy a nice walk or ride on the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail and then come back to the house to relax in the great back patio area!  The hosts also added an extra welcoming touch with chocolates on the pillows and dining area.  It was lovely meeting them both and John was very prompt with his responses throughout the whole process.  We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend this house!"
9012578,55646728,2015-12-03,35343270,Anne,"This place is a real gem!  It's super cozy and well kept, in a beautiful neighborhood minutes away from everything we wanted to experience in the Pacific Grove/Monterey area.  Our hosts were super accommodating and friendly.  The photos do not do it justice; super beautiful!"
9012578,55935428,2015-12-07,6171012,Gil,"John was a wonderful host- he met us at the door showed us around his home- we had everything we needed. He went out of his way to make sure we felt comfortable. Fantastic location, walking distance from restaurants, walking trails etc. When we return, we are definitely staying here."

We would come back again for sure."
9012578,59233669,2016-01-08,20136068,Melanie,"John greeted us and showed us his lovely house. The house is well equipped and the recreational trail is close. We saw harbor seals by the trail on the way to the aquarium.

"

The house was well stoked with pots and pans, towels, blankets, etc. The bed was also super comfortable! All in all, a great weekend getaway in a nice house. "
9012578,60966702,2016-01-30,1210741,Trudi,"We so enjoyed our 5 days in John's wonderful house. What a superb location----a block to the ocean and a short walk into town. We felt completely at home with great internet, tv, perfectly outfitted kitchen and comfortable bed. Although we spent most of our time outdoors, the house was so nice to come home to. The shower was great, choice of free coffees a nice touch and everything was just spotless. What a cool vacation we had...thanks and we will be back!"
9012578,61154333,2016-02-01,42718426,Patris,John made us feel very welcome.   
9012578,62245470,2016-02-13,51534538,Gary,"Ours was a homecoming of sorts as we use to live in PG.  This was a continuation of where we left off.  The accommodations were exactly what we were looking for...convenience to everything within walking distance.  The lovely adobe building was in a quite neighborhood, pleasant neighbors.  I would easily recommend this comfortable abode to anyone.  "

9012578,64761610,2016-03-08,23035879,Kathryn,"How can I possibly tell you how much we love this place? A small but efficient house in a charming setting just a city block from the ocean. The house is well appointed, clean, cozy - and did I already say a block from the ocean? Also just a few blocks from ""downtown"" Pacific Grove, which has first-class reataurants, coffee and wine bars, a movie theater and a good food market with a great deli counter. In the other direction, the house is a longer walk to Monterey, specifically Cannery Row and the glorious Monterey Aquarium. The back yard is fenced and has glorious flowers but - after all the house was a block from the ocean so we did not sit there as often as we had planned.
John and Corazon are wonderful hosts and tend this little gem with care. If you need them, they are right there. But this is a well-cared for house,  and the only time we needed them was to explain their high tech television. We ended up not watching it much, but it is there. 
I do hope we can come back again next year!"
9012578,65791103,2016-03-17,55018095,Margaret,The description was very accurate and the house was actually nicer than the photos showed - they must have been old. The house had everything we needed and was in a perfect location. We would definitely visit again.
9012578,66030463,2016-03-19,28194421,Rebecca,A lovely warm and relaxing small home in a great neighbourhood. Well situated to walk to the aquarium and lovely coastal walk. Everything we needed!
9012578,66422032,2016-03-22,49443181,Hollie,The home was tidy and clean upon arrival with a lot of brochures and lists of things to do in the area. Such a beautiful location!! We were able to walk to Lover's Pointe and to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in a matter of minutes. Quality rental in a historic part of town with a spacious layout and lovely back yard. We will stay again!! Thank you!!
9012578,66672324,2016-03-24,23654319,Joanie,"John's darling  home fit our needs to a ""T"". The home is one block from the coastal recreation path and a quick 3-minute walk to Lover's Point. In the other direction, we were only 5 minutes walking distance from the quaint old town of Pacific Grove with its surprising selection of excellent dining, thrift stores and specialty shops. To boot, PG's Monday farmers' market is one block away. And the Monterey Bay Aquarium is only 20  minutes by foot on the path. The home itself is perfect for a couple and has a very nice collection of pottery for dining."
9012578,67833842,2016-03-31,13426505,Lovelyn,We had a wonderful time in Monetrey. John's place is like a home far away from home. The house is clean and perfect for a small family. It has everything we needed to make our stay comvenient especially we have a 6-year old boy. Its close to 17-mile drive scenic Peeble Beach. Walkable distance to Cannery Row and The Monterey Aquarium. We visited the Carmel Mission Basilica and it took us only 10-15minutes drive from John's place. I absolutely recommend this place. 
9012578,68697892,2016-04-06,55046679,Chelsea,"This house was the perfect spot for my family!  The location couldn't be better.  We walked a few short blocks to downtown Pacific Grove to check out the shops and get coffee and dinner.  We walked a few short blocks in the other direction to get to Lover's Point.  We were able to go to the aquarium everyday, and the house was a great spot to come back to for lunch.  It was especially nice to have the back patio to add a little more space.  What a great spot!"
9012578,68867618,2016-04-07,52042153,Deborah,We loved John's house.  It was clean and had everything you could want.  A short walk to the aquarium and cannery row.  Would definitely come back!  Thanks John for the perfect experience!!!

9012578,71402571,2016-04-25,1563628,Colleen,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights at John's home in Pacific Grove.  When we arrived the home was so cute and cozy and we had chocolates on our pillows.  During our trip we participated in the Big Sur Marathon.  After the race it was wonderful to come back to the house and have the comforts of home. The home was on a quiet street close to the ocean and each night we had a peaceful, restful sleep.  During the day we visited the trail along the ocean and spent time on Lover's Point watching the waves crash against the rocks.  It was such a relaxing time.  Thanks for everything John, we will definitely be back the next time we travel through Pacific Grove."
9012578,71701899,2016-04-27,46800211,Chris,We loved staying here! great location and super clean ! Thank you for the chocolates on the pillows 
9012578,72300144,2016-05-01,21024816,Heather,"The house was exactly as expected. It was very quaint and in the perfect location for our needs. John left an assortment of guide books as well as chocolate on the pillows, which was a nice treat. We walked to breakfast and dinner from the house and also did a nice oceanside walk one morning. The perfect perch if you plan to spend a weekend in PG or Monterey."
9012578,72822403,2016-05-04,8955852,Jean,"This bungalow was perfectly located in a quiet Pacific Grove  neighborhood between the seaside walking/bike trail and the fun and funky Lighthouse Drive shopping district.  The Aquarium, Cannery Row, great little cafes, and bike rentals were within easily walkable distance. Spotlessly clean inside the cottage, the bed was comfortable, the kitchen well-equipped, and the backyard patio warm and sunny.  The small bathroom was functional and only lacked a hair dryer that may have been hiding in a drawer somewhere.  Thank you, John, for sharing your delightful little cottage in Pacific Grove with me. "
9012578,73138626,2016-05-07,35916925,Robin,"We had a wonderful few days at this place. It is an absolutely perfect location, walking distance to the ocean and both Pacific Grove and Monterey. The house is cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed. The bed in the master is super comfortable! Heads up that the bathroom is super tiny (1 person can fit at a time) and there's virtually no counter space, but that's just a tiny detail. We didn't meet the host but the check in/out process was very smooth and easy. I definitely recommend this place!"
9012578,73719682,2016-05-09,67964511,Scott,"The home and location are excellent. Within walking distance to everything; ocean, food, and a quick 2 minute drive to cannery row. We will without a doubt stay again. Thanks again, John."

9012578,79009433,2016-06-10,49424622,Alison,This was a great little house just a short walk to Cannery Row. We'd never been to the area before and this was perfect- far enough out that you have no trouble parking on the street but close enough you can just hop on the bike path or walk right to shops and restaurants. This was the perfect place for our stay- A+
9012578,79628879,2016-06-13,715393,Randy,"John is a responsive host. Any question I had, he was quick to reply. The house is fabulous, with a comfortable family room, dining room, well-equipped kitchen, and bedroom. The bathroom is small, but worked fine for us. The home is located on a quiet street with friendly neighbors...and is very close to local shops, restaurants and (Website hidden by Airbnb) well as Lover's Point. We hope to come back soon!"
9012578,81032217,2016-06-20,38411340,Rose,"My family of 4 stayed at this place for 2 nights and we never used our car the whole time we were there. It was wonderful and we had a great time. The location is truly a short walk from the beach and an even shorter walk to Lighthouse Ave., the main road with restaurants and shops. The house has a nice backyard/patio that we used a lot to eat meals and where the kids played. The owner is very responsive and professional. I already booked this place for two more times this summer and I look forward to going back.  "
9012578,81556387,2016-06-23,77883899,Amy,"John was fast to respond to my inquiries! The house did not disappoint! I have to be (Website hidden by Airbnb) was so close to the ocean, beach and trails I did not spend a great deal of time at the home but when I did,
It was quite comfortable. Everything is within walking distance (Aquarium, Cannery Tow, restaurants and such). I loved every minute of it and will return! Thank you for your hospitality! "
9012578,81928379,2016-06-25,5958195,Debra,"We loved staying at John's place, it was as cute as could be and so close to everything.

9012578,82714299,2016-06-29,71399975,Jane,This house was adorable and in a prime Pacific Grove location.  We were able to walk to restaurants and to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  The host was very welcoming and made himself easy to contact if needed (we didn't need to).  Everything in the house was handy and well explained.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
9012578,83924318,2016-07-04,11828356,Elaina,We had a wonderful time in Pacific Grove at John's place. It was so comfortable and accommodating. We especially enjoyed the full size kitchen and the amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. The neighbors on both sides of the house were very kind to us. 
9012578,84338517,2016-07-06,37231639,Tanner,"The house was great. The location was perfect for us, and we were very comfortable. We were also able to make breakfast one morning to avoid eating out "

9012578,86877938,2016-07-17,54520002,Ewan,Great little rental in Pacific Grove/Monterey. Everything you need for a few days in a beautiful part of the world. Clean with good bathroom and shower it is small but 4 can manage. Was slightly worried about the fold down bed but turned out to be perfectly comfortable and we slept soundly in it. Kitchen has a good fridge and everything else you need including a decent coffee maker. 2 minute walk to the sea and near Cannery Row. Lots of interesting wildlife to see and restaurants and supermarkets are good. Recommended.
9012578,87323663,2016-07-19,82910129,John-Cole,Didn't meet the host and no big deal to me. The place was cute and nice neighborhood. Great location to everything and if you don't mind walking it's not a bad walk to everything. Super close to the water. If you're a light sleeper I don't recommend it since you will definitely hear seagulls! Only downside was floor was dirty left everyone's feet/socks black on the bottoms and bathroom was cramped. Other then that was a cute and nice place to stay. 
9012578,88173518,2016-07-23,57542135,Dana,"Wonderful!    We absolutely loved everything!    So clean, organized, quiet and friendly neighborhood;  it offered everything we needed for a perfect vacation.   I got up early each morning, brewed some coffee then sat out on the beautiful patio to take in all the fresh crisp air and listen to the sea gulls (being a North Texan I found this to be a novelty).    We parked our car (initially thought someone had parked in our parking space in front of the home until we found out that you can park anywhere along the road) and walked to all the points of interest.    I was able to spend time with a few local residents and found everyone so likeable;  also love that this area is dog friendly.    Thank you so much John for responding immediately to every question that I had and allowing us to stay in your wonderful beach home."

9012578,93892538,2016-08-14,23719705,Ji-Hyun,We stayed at this place for three nights with two toddlers. We all really liked the place. Just a two minute walk to the seaside and ten minute walk to a beach. We experienced power outage probably because we used the oven. John was very responsive: he came within 15 minutes and fixed the circuit breaker. And he provided useful information about the area. Highly recommended! 
9012578,97245049,2016-08-26,87594107,Hlaing,It was a quick get away for my family and we enjoyed the short stay. Close to the seaside park area and bike trail. Also really close to Aquarium. Very cozy and quiet neighborhood.

It is walking distance to Cannery Row and Pacific Grove, with tons of delicious food and coffee places within minutes. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a wedding in Carmel, and were more than pleased with everything. We walked down by the water in the morning and saw an array of birds, seals and even otters. We felt right at home, and everything was very clean, organized and spacious. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway or if anything brings you to the area!"
9012578,101300693,2016-09-12,92899817,Ian,"We thought this was a great spot for a couple looking to explore Monterrey.  The simple one bedroom home was comfortable (including the bed), clean and situated in a charming and quiet neighborhood.  The house is just blocks from the coast, and a few more to quaint downtown Pacific Grove.  It's also just a few minutes by car to the aquarium and historic cannery row in Monterrey.  The host was responsive, and the process was simple and straight-forward.  Great place to stay in the area."

9012578,105931807,2016-10-03,81701535,Carolyn,John was very nice and accommodating over the phone.  The space was as described.  The master bedroom bed was very comfortable with nice linens.  The living room was cute and cozy.  The bathroom was a bit tight in terms of space and only accommodated 1 person at a time.  The kitchen was adequate but needs a few more wine glasses and plates.  Loved the location and biking on the beach bike paths!  Also enjoyed the short walk uptown for coffee and breakfast at Crema.
9012578,105977805,2016-10-03,28439834,Adam,Nice homestay.Everything is fine in the house.And it is very close to 17 miles Dr. Road.We had a wonderful stay.

9012578,108888688,2016-10-17,31936350,Sarah,"This charming house is located just two blocks from the beach, and is a short drive away from historic downtown Monterey. We had a wonderful time enjoying the scenery in the neighborhood-- the 10 minute walk to Lover's Point Park is a must! The house is also conveniently located near the Pacific Grove entry gate for the 17-mile drive (very scenic, with great views of the ocean and wildlife). The house was clean and well taken care of, and our host was very kind, attentive, and left detailed instructions-- he thought of everything! We absolutely recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in the Monterey area."

9012578,112178298,2016-11-04,3683265,Lisa,"The LOCATION was wonderful - one block from Lover's Point in a quiet neighborhood. The clean, cozy home reminded me of my grandmother's, with a comfortable bed and cooking capabilities being most important for our stay. Single person bathroom was not an issue since there were only two of us. Communication with our host was very good, with every needed detail explained. 
We had a relaxing getaway at John's cottage ~"
9012578,112820271,2016-11-07,30016473,Kolbi,"We liked everything about this place, except for the kitchen, which was unfortunately why we booked this house. 

The pros: location, location, location! This house is located near the ocean (walking distance; about 5 min), downtown Pacific Grove (5 min walk to a wonderful Greek restaurant called Petra), and the Monterey Bay Aquarium (5 min drive). Additionally, the house is adorable and located in a safe area.

The cons: the kitchen really isn't functional for cooking. The house does not have any ventilation (and the windows are non-functional as described), which is problematic because there is a gas stove that needs ventilation when being used. We tried cooking with the back door open, but even then the two smoke detectors in the kitchen began beeping almost immediately. This was really a bummer because we had planned on cooking half of our meals."

But it was wonderful.  A block from the beach, which is breathtaking, within walking distance to shops and, as it turned out, two blocks away from my best friend from elementary school.  Who knew?  A beautiful little house with everything you could want.  Great feng shui, quiet neighborhood, plenty of parking (but don't try to park in the driveway, even if you have a small car, and I do).  And a very comfortable bed.  And my little dog, Alice, loved it, too, with plenty of places to walk and take her as well.  Close to everything you'd want to see and go to on the Peninsula.  I highly recommend this house as long as you're not there when I want to visit!"
9012578,113835041,2016-11-13,51675468,Mandy And Dave,"This is a charming house in a perfect location.  Very quiet, short walk to the beach with plenty of easy street parking. We would definitely stay there again. "

It's a great spot. "

9012578,120771791,2016-12-11,100440148,Rick,"The place was exactly as described, except the location was even better.  You have terrific views of the bay as soon as you step outside, and are a short walk to the Aquarium and related shopping.  

John was a great host, giving excellent details regarding the place and it's amenities.  It had everything we could have needed and was very clean and organized.  It will be the first place we look for when we make future trips out that way."

Only stayed one night so didn't use much, but we had everything we needed. Close to Il Vecchio, our favorite restaurant, and to the butterfly sanctuary. We had a great stay. :)"
9012578,121755401,2016-12-18,4895435,Sterling,"A great home base for exploring Pacific Grove on foot, this compact, clean and efficient house is centrally located on a quiet residential street which ends at the sparkling Monterey Bay in one direction (Lovers Point and MBA/Cannery Row walkable by path), and the charming Lighthouse Avenue in the other. John's communications were very thorough, responsive and detailed. We look forward to staying here again. "

9012578,130118460,2017-02-04,40502219,Jill,This cottage was the perfect place to stay in Pacific Grove for our family. It had everything we needed and is just a block from the ocean and also from restaurants. There was a miscommunication with the cleaners so it wasn't ready for us when we arrived after our check in time but John was very accommodating and took care of it right away. We would love to stay here again.
9012578,130375459,2017-02-05,74154923,TzuJung,Very efficient house from whose front door can see the ocean. Smooth check-in and check-out. Easy and relaxing stay!

Accommodations were perfect for our needs and it was a great place to stay.  Would definitely stay there again and recommend John's place to anyone going to the PG area.

9012578,140258747,2017-03-28,1575922,Charla,We enjoyed our stay.
9012578,140973061,2017-04-01,2687748,William,"John's home is a great launchpad to explore the peninsula, about halfway between downtown Pacific Grove and the start of Cannery Row. It's a comfortable house with a great back patio and dining area (with a little ocean view from the bay window). The kitchen was better appointed than expected and we were able to cook just fine. We're looking forward to coming back!"
9012578,141299328,2017-04-02,106435964,Janet,"Very good location; not the fanciest, but ok for an overnight stay.  Very helpful host."

9012578,142562830,2017-04-08,29146701,Jack,Johns house is beautiful and exactly as described and pictures. He remembered all of the details and the location is hard to beat. I walked five blocks to the annual Pacific Grove street festival and had a blast. Thanks!
9012578,142912828,2017-04-09,63428473,Jenni,"John's place is incredibly convenient, we really enjoyed being able to walk wherever we wanted to go!"
9012578,145719248,2017-04-19,42781318,Norbert,"Super emplacement, lits et canapé-lit confortables, cuisine bien équipé, super terrasse pour l'été, mais malheureusement mauvaises odeurs, entretient négligé et manque d'aération. "
9012578,146173087,2017-04-21,103929384,Heidi,"We really enjoyed our stay at John's place! It was a quaint little place with all the necessities that we needed. Check-in and check-out was a breeze and directions were clear and to the point. We loved the location of John's place - it was walkable distance to so many great places including a strip with local restaurants and shops as well as the monterey aquarium. If we are every in the area again, we would definitely be looking to see if this place is available!"
9012578,147016080,2017-04-24,74484073,Ryan,"Great house right by the water. For what we paid, it's hard to imagine getting a better deal. The house is one block from the bike path next to the ocean. As soon as you come out the front door, the ocean is right there staring at you. There are some great places to eat very close by and the property is an easy walk to the Aquarium, Cannery Row, and tons more great places to eat and shop. I would have chosen a different place for any reason. The attractions in the area are all easily accessible but the location of the house is in a nice quiet spot right by the ocean. Also, there's a beach within ten blocks that has a great restaurant next to it. Couldn't have asked for more. I will definitely stay here again."
9012578,147274522,2017-04-25,19265757,Spencer,John's place was perfect for our long weekend. A very clean little cottage within a 5 minute walk to downtown Pacific Grove. Would definitely stay here again!

9012578,149136324,2017-05-02,848363,Suzanne," This 1920s bungalow located one block from Monterey Bay is a little slice of heaven . We stayed here for the Big Sur Marathon last week. It's cozy, and quaint with a darling court yard to sit in and enjoy your coffee/tea in the AM and  wine/ in the PM.  The kitchen is well equipt for a couple, a family with one child or three friend exploring Monterey/Pacific Grove. Area. Both the bed and surprisingly enough the sleeper sofa are sooo comfortable!!! We walked and biked along the 15 mile sea wall, laid in the sand on the beach, watched the seals and even spotted a whale. Take your own beach towel, yoga Matt or beach chair!!  The restaurants, museums, Cannery Row,and Fishetmans Warf are all a short walk or drive. It's located close to the  infamous 17 mile drive  and the 101 highway to Big Sur national park !!! I recommend Gianni's for pizza and Italian, The Fisher'sWife for Seafood and the Victorian Cafe for breakfast! We will be back next year for sure!!! "

9012578,149943573,2017-05-06,570491,Kenny,"Cigarette odors and strong air freshener smell ruined the great location and house. Also, decorations are dated and dingy"
9012578,150394296,2017-05-07,36381780,Yang,"The room was smaller than expected, a little distance from the sea. The neighborhood is quiet. The parking is convenient, our family is a little crowded."
9012578,150706881,2017-05-08,2632532,Christopher,Close to everything! Perfect for my girlfriend and I!
9012578,150892373,2017-05-09,127446172,Marta,Quaint home in a very quiet neighborhood and near the ocean ~ very nice combination. Thank you John

We three girls live in the house and we love it very much! The lovely house has everything we need! I love everything in the house, especially the soft blue blanket in restroom. I hope to live there if I have chance to visit this place."

The church on the corner had a choir that day, and it was lovely to hear! Pac grove is a beautiful little town, and John's place is a beautiful little cottage !!! "
9012578,153071446,2017-05-19,130723875,Paul,very nice house
9012578,153332557,2017-05-20,12974419,Mandy,This cozy home is located just a few blocks from the movie theater and nice restaurants. We ate at Jenini's kitchen. I recommend the steak coulotte (and I'm not s steak person!) Walking through this sleepy town on Friday night was relaxing.
9012578,153686788,2017-05-21,42637629,晴,Great 
9012578,154012982,2017-05-22,671156,Elisa,"The location of this cottage cannot be beat!  The stay was worth it for that reason alone.  You step out the front door and can see the ocean!  Cottage is clean, comfortable and has everything you need for your stay.  I'd say it is smaller than the pictures make it look but otherwise lives up to expectations.  Would definitely stay here again."
9012578,154944749,2017-05-26,127268252,Sue,Close to bay and to downtown
9012578,155177923,2017-05-27,6017305,Niki,"John's place is super cute and is an absolutely perfect spot for two people. It's a 1 block walk to a beautiful view  / park on the Pacific. It's certainly walkable to downtown Monterey, but Lyfts are plenty in the area.

I'd highly recommend this place. Probably tight for more than 2 people, but it's perfect for a 2 person get away. I will be back!"
9012578,156071973,2017-05-29,41406314,Jackie,Johns place was perfect for our small family to have a weekend trip. The location was fabulous. We were able to walk to the beach and to dinner as well. 
9012578,156735818,2017-05-31,42298080,Pete,"This is a cute, well-maintained place in a fantastic location for people looking to be within walking distance of both the beach and many great restaurants/shops.  It was very clean and the bed was comfortable. There isn't a ton of space, but its efficiently laid out and was perfect for us as a couple in town for a short stay.  You'll want to be outside in this area anyway!  It felt like our private vacation home, which is what we look for."
9012578,157714915,2017-06-04,69992,Lauren,John's place was the perfect size and location for our long weekend in town. Everything was clean and comfortable. Communication beforehand and instructions in the house made things extremely easy. We had a wonderful time!
9012578,158650881,2017-06-07,34491254,Kelly,Awesome little house for a couple or even 2 couples with the pullout couch in the living room. I even locked myself out and John was on top of it pronto. All in all great house in the perfect place in Monterey a block away from lovers point and walking distance to a lot of restaurants and other nightlife
9012578,158868800,2017-06-08,20262574,Peter,"This place is a clean charming house, two blocks from the bay (where you can see otters play!), and a 15 minute walk to cannery row. Two thumbs up!"

9012578,160838939,2017-06-15,20237097,Robert,"John's place is ideally located for a visit to the beautiful Pacific Grove area. The house is very compact but has a backyard patio area.

Furniture, fixtures and furnishings are in need of updating while still functional.

Cost is steep but not out of line for this area. Beautiful neighborhood with two interesting 100+ year old churches within a couple of hundred feet. Bay is a couple of blocks...very close. "
9012578,161358668,2017-06-17,85866722,Tiffani,Thank you so much! Such a cute quiet little place. We brought our two boxers and it was perfect walking distance from down town & Lovers point..Highly recommemade

9012578,166765467,2017-07-04,119453003,Richard,"Short walking to seal beach, downtown, Lover's Point, even the golf course.  We love walking the neighborhoods and wondering at the Victorian, craftsman and various other architecture.  Enjoyed the wi-fi and patio."
9012578,167743701,2017-07-07,18103,Emily,Adorable little house in a perfect location in beautiful PG! Very comfy and had everything we needed. 
9012578,168899930,2017-07-10,3286315,Gustav,"Good things first: the house is centrally located and has just about everything you need. John is super easy to communicate with and very very helpful - even when things doesn't work out as planned. 

However, the house wasn't clean at all at check in. And future renters should be aware that it's a very old house and much of the furniture/facilities is pretty worn as a result. Especially the bed is not very comfortable - tilted.   Also a window cracked when we tried opening it."
9012578,170496033,2017-07-15,131210841,Charlotte,"Nice location with a lot of oppitunities nearby. The house had everything we needed meanwhile it was simple and easy. 
"
9012578,170962049,2017-07-16,104357433,Alexandra,"This is going to be a mixed review. Positives: location is great, walking distance from the beach walk, a few restaurants/cafes and Monterey seafront. There is tons of free street parking outside if your car doesn't fit on the drive. The bedroom was nice and cosy. Even though the house is small, there are separate areas where you can sit when other member of your party is sleeping.
Negatives: old noisy boiler, dirty windows and blinds. Blinds are also broken in a few places. Old musty smell in the living room."
9012578,172394757,2017-07-20,81354903,Jacqueline,"Great location! It's small, yet efficient. I wouldn't suggest it for more than a 2 adults, and maybe 2 young kids. "
9012578,173049435,2017-07-22,116589548,Richard,Situated in beautiful Pacific Grove and close to attractions and dining in Monterey.
9012578,175290601,2017-07-28,30847144,Antonia,"We are frequent visitors to PG. This was our first time renting a house and could not be more pleased. John's place is perfectly located for all our favorite PG/Monterey places. Walkable to Lovers Pt, Downtown PG, Happy Girl Cafe and an easy bike ride to the aquarium. The house is darling and equipped for what you will need. We spent a full week with our son and dog.  Thanks John. We had a great time."

Une étape agréable."
9012578,181444132,2017-08-12,19515645,Joan,"The place is a block from the ocean. The location is not only scenic but it's within easy walking distance of restaurants, shops and cinema. It's also within close proximity to the Monterey Aquarium."
9012578,182005525,2017-08-13,138653779,Jessica,"Cute little place in a quiet neighborhood. Pricey but that is Pacific Grove for you, and it was nice to get the whole place to ourselves. Great for a couple or small family weekend getaway. "

9012578,186505168,2017-08-24,9464682,Heather And Bob,"Awesome location!    We walked one block to the beach from the house and jogged along the ocean. We saw seals and otters.   It was perfect.

It was nice that our 13 year old son  could sleep on the pullout sofa which he said was comfortable.

 We would stay here again."
9012578,186862377,2017-08-25,81558228,Heather,Lovely clean home! It was a great base for exploring the Monterey and Carmel area.  Super close to food and entertainment and John made it so easy to check in and out. We would definitely stay here again!
9012578,187245925,2017-08-26,6155392,Elaine,"John's place is as described in his write up and others' post. Easy access, centrally located, close to shore; very pleasant."
9012578,187870626,2017-08-27,6047887,Eric,We absolutely loved staying at John's house. It was clean and comfortable and everything was accurately described. John gave us a very detailed description of everything we needed to know at the time of booking. We loved the neighborhood and enjoyed walking around. The ocean was just a block away and downtown Pacific Grove was just a few blocks away. We fell in love with little Pacific Grove while we were there. We would definitely stay here again.
9012578,190215074,2017-09-03,1281327,Logan,"Very cute little place. Despite the heat, we had a nice time walking around the area and going to the aquarium over the weekend."
9012578,191004118,2017-09-05,17762409,Christopher,Check in was a breeze and the place was very comfortable for 4 of us while we are in the Monterey area. My wife and I will definitely stay here again when we go back.
9012578,191775471,2017-09-08,79871736,Victoria,"Nice, cozy house near the sea in Pacific Grove. Great place to explore Monterrey and Carmel. Thank you !"
9012578,192068753,2017-09-09,6743756,Bridget,"We had a great, one-night stay here! The place is cute and very clean. It was super easy to park, get in, and all the details were laid out very clearly. It's in a wonderful location, too!"
9012578,192951954,2017-09-11,50397447,Jack,Good apartment and in an excellent location
9012578,193498846,2017-09-13,23834088,Alexis,A fantastic location! Pacific Grove is a wonderful place to stay with lots to see and do.
9012578,195263959,2017-09-18,134274415,Dave,"Wow, this house was wonderful and we completely fell in love with Monterey! Perfectly located between Lighthouse Avenue and the Ocean Blvd walk and just a 10 minute walk to Cannery Row and the Aquarium (with stunning views and wildlife along the way!) The house has a lovely backyard where you can chill out and catch some sun and the bed was very comfortable. John was easy to reach, responsive and very helpful throughout our stay. I would highly recommend this house if you're visiting Monterey, just a shame we couldn't stay longer!"
9012578,196025556,2017-09-21,24141937,Julia,"Really enjoyed our stay here. The town of Pacific grove was beautiful, easy walk to wine bars, supermarket etc. The highlight was walking down the end of the street to the beach and seeing sea otters fishing off the rocks everyday"
9012578,197212153,2017-09-24,16299823,Jackie,Beautiful house with the perfect location. Thank you for having us!
9012578,197525565,2017-09-25,100936613,Jared,"My feeling is location is great and kitchen is the best stocked ive seen. Decor wasn't our style (Website hidden by Airbnb) Bed wasn't fluffy but there were a lot of pillows available. Tub didn't drain, but overall a good place to stay, just not our cup of tea. A lot of space available for those who enjoy that. Did not go into garage, so can not speak to that. Large cemented backyard with high fences for complete privacy. Host had a large amount of information available for anything you might need."
9012578,198834440,2017-09-30,138976443,Yolette,"Had a wonderful 5 night stay in the most adorable, spacious, and clean one bdrm home with an EXCELLENT location in Pacific Grove. It was an even shorter walk to the ocean in one direction, and to shops in the other, than I expected (less than 5 min). The neighborhood is peaceful and we enjoyed morning coffee sitting in the lovely back patio. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen well stocked for simple cooking. We highly recommend and hope to return some day! 5 out of 5 stars for sure. Thank you John!"
9012578,201139594,2017-10-07,133587704,Simon,This is a great rental with everything you need. Ideally situated to chill out and relax in Pacific Grove. Lovers Point and Cannery Row are a short walk away.
9012578,202326548,2017-10-10,5489523,Ala,"The apartment and location are phenomenal, walking distance from the beach, coffee shops, restaurants, amazing views that you'd have to drive to see otherwise. We wouldn't think twice about going there again"
9012578,202763348,2017-10-12,10834607,Stephanie,"My husband and I plus our two small dogs enjoyed a relaxing two night stay at John’s home in beautiful Pacific Grove. The location was perfect for what we wanted, which was walkability to the coastal trails, parks, restaurants and shops. The fully fenced backyard in a quiet residential neighborhood was a nice place to relax in the evenings with the dogs. The kitchen was well equipped with all the tools needed to enjoy a meal in. We had an excellent stay and would definitely return and recommend."
9012578,203021701,2017-10-13,10705708,Dana,"Cute, cozy and quiet home, located a block from the ocean and biking/walking trail, a few blocks from the quaint downtown area and a few minutes drive from the aquarium and Cannery Row. We had everything we needed and John was friendly, accommodating, and easily accessible. Thanks for a great stay!"
9012578,204169291,2017-10-16,77779935,Beki,"We had a great time in Pacific Grove and loved the location of the house. We were walking distance (under half mile) to the water and also to ""Downtown."" Great place to be!
Upon arrival we had a fun sighting of a buck hanging out across the street, which we began keeping our eyes open for. 
Thank you for everything!"
9012578,204570898,2017-10-18,36280415,Lisa,"Location is awesome, walking distance to downtown and the ocean. Place is clean and comfortable."
9012578,206949362,2017-10-27,29066205,Jan,Location location location-six houses from Bay and a couple blocks from downtown. Great mattress and bedding. Plenty of private outside space for enjoying the weather. We will stay again
9012578,207768786,2017-10-29,88538257,Annette,"John's place was quite charming and the perfect location for those who want to spend time right near the ocean and close to Cannery Row.  We could hear the sea lions barking from the front porch, so cool!  We brought our bikes and rode along the coast for several miles enjoying the beautiful views.  The back yard is private and the neighborhood very quite. We even saw two deer slowly walking down the street Sunday morning! 

Keep in mind the Pacific Grove climate dose not require central heat or air so if you are staying on a chillier night you will need the space heater provided."
9012578,208711763,2017-11-02,131669014,Ciara,"The location was perfect! A quick, lovely stroll into the town of pacific grove right along the water. The bed was very comfortable and the heaters heated the whole house in a few minutes! Lovely hot shower! The house is in perfect condition, and was super clean on arrival! Perfect cottage for a few nights away."
9012578,210139020,2017-11-07,8955852,Jean,"Sweet little cottage in my favorite California seaside town. Very clean, very convenient location for walking to Lighthouse Avenue shops and cafes as well as ocean walk, comfy bed, and well-equipped kitchen. Bathroom is compact but not a big problem."
9012578,210492635,2017-11-09,100423085,Ruth,"Awesome place, close to walking trails, beach and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again."
9012578,210898920,2017-11-11,131656559,Steven,"The summary of John's home was exactly as it was in person.  It is a very nice, quaint house.  1930's style with older appliances with a great location."
9012578,211690873,2017-11-13,1742410,Sanjay,"Nice compact place, a short walk to many nice restaurants, and a few blocks from the beach. Had a pleasant stay. We saw deer at night!"

9012578,214382951,2017-11-25,16442521,Parlee,"Such a sweet and clean little cottage. Stayed with my two adult children.  The queen bed was so comfortable and so was the sleeping couch.  Location couldn't really be better, and is postured in a pure neighborhood-y area so close to the water.  I only wish we could have stayed longer."
9012578,215273774,2017-11-28,101522945,Pinkee,We love this place
9012578,215793473,2017-12-01,32721667,Christa,"We had a really lovely stay at John's place in charming Pacific Grove. The house is very comfortable, clean and efficient, just as he described. It is also charmingly cozy and in a wonderful location! We'd definitely choose to stay again at John's place. Thank you for a wonderful place to stay during our romantic & fun getaway."
9012578,216403775,2017-12-03,22164644,Jody,"This place is very true to the description and it was a wonderful experience—easy to do the self check-in, beautiful home, great location, cozy bed and pillows and a comfortable pull-out bed. The backyard is peaceful and neighborhood is quiet. John was very quick on communication. Thanks, John!"

9012578,219939372,2017-12-19,25824887,Gary,House was awesome. Very clean and you could see the bay from the front door.
9012578,220496851,2017-12-22,55366045,Ashley,"Sweet home, near great shops and coffee, and blocks from beautiful ocean! John was very hospitable and helpful!"
9012578,221203371,2017-12-25,69838428,Kathryn,Fantastic location. Cozy bungalow. Met our expectations.
9012578,221518425,2017-12-26,131802450,Emma,We only stayed for one night but it was a great space. The location is close to everything so we walked to have dinner and walked to get coffee the next morning. A very nice house with a great patio space. Definitely would love to stay here again.
9012578,221808506,2017-12-27,70492070,Nene,Enjoyed the stay. Very close to the beach. John is a great host.
9012578,222786562,2017-12-30,103609665,Carol,"John's Pacific Grove home was absolutely perfect for our family of 3. The house is charming, small but fully functional, and perfectly located: very short walk to the shore, Lover's Point, and all the shops and restaurants in PG.  The sofa in the living room folds out to a full size platform-style bed (not the saggy sofa bed with a bar in your back that you may have experienced) where our teen daughter slept comfortably. I always wonder when staying in vintage houses, but the shower in John's home had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. We were grateful to be able to bring our dog on vacation with us and appreciated the lovely but dog-proof (secure perimeter fence) back yard).  We had a great stay and hope to return."
9012578,223721642,2018-01-01,65132978,Lisa,We loved the location.  We were only a block or so from a major beach area and the bike/walking path.  We actually walked bike and walked all the way into Fisherman's warf on the trail without any trouble.
9012578,224638460,2018-01-03,154251474,Sarah,"Great spot, one block from the beach, charming house!"
9012578,225225948,2018-01-05,5849942,Amy,The house is in a great location. A block from the ocean and two blocks from downtown where there are several restaurants and interesting shops. Also it's on a quiet street with several charming older Pacific Grove homes. The house is sparely furnished but has everything you need for a comfortable stay and the wi-fi works well. We didn't meet John but his instructions were very clear and complete and his response time was immediate.
9012578,225501736,2018-01-06,52173770,Gary & Heather,"Great location, very cute cottage near to the Monterey Bay shoreline.  Enjoyed our short stay here, would love to come again."
9012578,225854947,2018-01-07,51006349,Medina,"Driving in from NY to SF we were looking for a place to stay so we can get some rest in between our long drive. We found Johns place and booked immediately. He was extremely responsive and accommodating. Also gave great recommendations.

His home is super cozy, clean and central to everything. I would highly recommend his place. 

Thank you again for everything! Will definitely book again in the future :)"
9012578,226450114,2018-01-10,8945393,Trevor,"This little house has all that you would need for a great stay. The location is perfect - just a block from the waterfront and a couple of blocks from the Pacific Grove downtown area that has a movie theater, restaurants, cafes and grocery stores. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a 15 minute walk!"
9012578,227052320,2018-01-13,124757733,Scott,"We enjoyed having a place to call home for a couple of days while our hardwood floors were being refinished.  John’s responses were amazingly quick.  The house is 1 block from the walking trail that runs along the ocean and right around the corner from some beautiful old churches.  The ease of check-in and check-out with the key lock box is fantastic.   The bed and bedding are super comfortable, and the kitchen & bathroom are very well appointed.  It was nice having a kitchen so we didn’t have to eat out.  The downsides were the light not working for the back patio (with two small dogs it would have been nice to have that light),  the couch is not comfortable for (Website hidden by Airbnb) least not for very long (we didn’t have to use it for sleeping...), the noise level from traffic during “rush hours”, and a very small bathroom."
9012578,227718837,2018-01-15,72009223,Julia,Wondeful location to stay
9012578,228058124,2018-01-17,165226613,Vicki,"My husband and I loved the convenience to the ocean, restaurants and shops. We could see the ocean out the front door and just a very short walk. Everything in the home was clean and supplied very well.  We loved the house and location. We are sure to be back again. "
9012578,228420414,2018-01-19,24844489,William,"Great stay at John’s little house, walking distance to some good restaurants, shopping, groceries and of course the amazing Pavel’s Bakery - get there early for the best selection. Just down the street from the beach and walking path, we enjoyed our short time there and would visit again."
9012578,229040869,2018-01-21,11697725,Alex,"Exactly as pictured - a clean, nice little cottage. Just a block off the beach and a couple of blocks out of downtown. Easy walking distance from Monterey and a short drive to Carmel. Definitely a great value for the price. "
9012578,229472784,2018-01-23,817194,Anna,The little blue house is in a quiet neighborhood just a block or two from the walking/bike path that goes all along the ocean front for miles. It's close to good restaurants and a movie theatre. Pacific Grove is such a peaceful little town. The house is comfortable and clean. There is an outdoor area to sit in the backyard on those sunny days. Thank you! We will be back.
9012578,229635759,2018-01-24,4730607,Havilah,"This place is very close to the beach, an amazing trail, the Aquarium, and Cannery Row. Nice, quiet, and private. We’d stay here again!"
9012578,230240656,2018-01-27,134917443,Bradley,"Make no mistake, the house is small, but it's plenty big for two.  It exudes charm, and the location can't be beat, in a lovely neighborhood just a block from the Monterey Bay waterfront.  Lots of shops and restaurants on nearby Lighthouse Avenue, and little more than a stone's throw from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Asilomar State Beach, and a delightful sanctuary for overwintering Monarch butterflies.  Pacific Grove and nearby Point Lobos State Reserve have some of the most spectacular rocky shoreline on the Pacific coast.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and only regret that it wasn't longer."
9012578,230737036,2018-01-28,51079195,Dan,"Great spot that’s walking distance to lovely pacific grove, and just steps from the waterfront walking trail. It’s perfect for a night or two to get away."
9012578,231545484,2018-02-01,33576627,Elaine,"This place is adorable. Vintage California architecture, but updated enough to be super functional. This blue little house, the color of the sky over Pacific Grove and the ocean, is just PERFECT for a stay of any length. Step out the door and the ocean is definitely only steps away. What a lovely view as you head out for your day! The neighborhood is near all services, but quiet and peaceful. The house is tidy, comfortable and fully equipped. We traveled with our dog, and felt totally welcome with a safe, fenced and gated backyard. 
This is a really lovely place from which to explore Central California's coast. We saw whales, otters and so much beautiful sea shore. The house was a gem of a place to come home to every night!!"
9012578,232404540,2018-02-04,36056028,Staci,Perfect location and cozy back patio :) We would stay again.
9012578,233457957,2018-02-09,7536623,Pat,"This cute little beach cottage is in a perfect location:  just a block and a half from the beautiful Monterey Bay, and, in the other direction, two blocks from a very nice shopping, cafe and restaurant street.  You can walk on the coastal trail to the Aquarium in just 20 minutes or so, or further into downtown Monterey.  (Public transportation exists, but the bus runs only once an hour.)  A bike will get you all the way to the Dunes Park on the same trail.  The house is compact and efficient; everything functions well, including wifi, TV and heating (it can be cool at night).  The bathroom is a bit cramped, but water pressure is good.  And it's nice to have a real stove, with plenty of pots and pans to cook with.  I would be happy to stay there again."
9012578,234167569,2018-02-11,27474779,Natalie,"The house was small and quaint but had everything we needed. John was quick to reply and keeps the home in excellent condition. You can't beat the location.  We were able to walk to shops, restaurants, and beach every day. I definitely recommend staying here!"
9012578,234690723,2018-02-13,22330728,William,Great location! Instructions were extensive and helpful. The place was full of light and very comfortable. I would stay there again! Thank you.
9012578,234947897,2018-02-14,21461024,Pierre,"We stayed just one night. The place is a little small for 4 people and a baby (which it was advertised as ok for), but it worked! We had a great time, and John’s house location is perfect!"
9012578,235191011,2018-02-15,17223803,Yolenda,"虽然在街边,但是也很安静,该有的都有,性价比高。"

9012578,249170981,2018-04-01,4201769,Tanya,John's place is really cute and in a great area - would definitely stay here again. We didn't get to meet John but all his communication was really clear and we didn't need any help at all. The house itself was set up really well for guests - comfortable bed and sofa-bed. Thanks for letting us stay at your great place John!
9012578,250630485,2018-04-05,174701837,Andrea,Loved it
9012578,252248889,2018-04-09,17104909,Cynthia,Delightful cozy space in the heart of Pacific Grove. Close to everything marine as well as great restaurants and shops. The classic little bungalow really made us feel we were part of this fascinating historical/natural area. Many thanks!
9012578,252697045,2018-04-11,19005004,Elana,The house was quaint and comfortable and the location was walking distance to the beach and restaurants and shops. My husband and pup and I stayed here on our way to spend the day in Big Sur and it was the perfect set up. We woke up and went for a walk on the path along the beach and looked at seals in the ocean then walked into the small town for a yummy breakfast. Then we took off to Big Sur and it was a short and beautiful drive. The location is also perfect for going to the Aquarium! We would stay here again. :)
9012578,254435839,2018-04-16,137527456,Erwin,"Tidy, well outfitted."
9028761,73924407,2016-05-11,4591051,Dave & Lee,"We've stayed in dozens of airbnb homes ands have never had better host communication.  This is a very clean home in a very quiet Pacific Grove Neighborhood.  It is difficult to pinpoint what we liked the most about our experience.  Without a doubt, the dining area and gathering room off the kitchen was fabulous.  It is a light and bright space superb for entertaining.  And in fact we enjoyed a delightful meal with friends in this space which was likely the highlight of the trip.  The master bedroom suite is amazing.  Cozy and comfortable!  Quiet!  Made all the better by a private patio that walks out onto a delightful koi pond.  A perfect place to enjoy morning coffee or an evening glass of wine.  If you venture out into the garden, you will love it.  It's delightful.  A short stroll to Asilomar Beach is a must!  At sunset is even better!  We are delighted to recommend this home for your Pacific Grove visit.  And we hope you are fortunate enough to meet your host, Lily."
9028761,74158211,2016-05-13,59901654,Kimb,"The home is BETTER than the photos! The images simply can't really capture the true beauty and energy of this place. This home was utterly charming, a little slice of heaven. During our downtime in the house, we had a ball playing ping pong and hanging outside under the stars in the evening. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. We especially loved the little pond outside the master bedroom that lulled us to sleep.

We couldn't have enjoyed our stay at this property more if you paid us.  Everything was pristinely clean, the beds were super comfortable, the home itself was beautifully decorated. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed. Lily was great! She was welcoming and promptly got back to us with answers to the couple of questions we had. Her book of local suggestions knocked our trip out of the park. 

The house is perfectly located. Minutes to the waterfront, to the monarch butterfly area, to downtown Pacific Grove and to 17 mile drive. About 10 minutes to downtown Monterey or Carmel. There was grocery shopping nearby (Safeway and Trader Joe's). And, of course, the restaurant options were fantastic. The first thing you will want to do is head down the road to Pavel's bakery to pick up a loaf of their Farmer's Bread (what a great find, thanks to Lily's suggestions). 

Finally, when we wanted to take day trips, HWY 1 was also close by (easy access.) By far, one of the best Air Bnb experiences I've ever had."
9028761,79891427,2016-06-14,71399506,Li,"Love the spaces and the number of beds in the house that can offer my family of 7 to stay.  Each bathroom has plenty of towels we can use.  The decors in the house are nice.  They just put in a fire pit which makes it nice for us to hang out at night and look at the nightly sky.  We only stay here for one night, but if I know what this house and area was like, I would have booked an extra night.  There are also plenty of entertainment inside the house.  Lots of board games for the children when the adults are prepping to go out or preparing breakfast.  Lots of musical instruments (including an upright piano) my girls loved playing.  Table tennis in the garage.  The 17 miles drive is very close to this house and a very nice drive.  We were delighted to see seals on the way of the drive."
9028761,80884358,2016-06-20,16861042,Ryan,"Lily was an incredible host and took the time to personally show my family and I the house and all its amenities.  She was very welcoming and made the entire process easy through her informative and immediate communication.  The house could not have been more ideal as it easily hosted 6 people, which allowed us to enjoy the greater surrounding area of Pacific Grove.  "
9028761,81130636,2016-06-21,74015805,John,We had a wonderful time.  It's a very special place and my kids all want to go back.
9028761,82901892,2016-06-30,65388111,Lauren,"What a great stay in PG! The house exceeded any expectations I had, even after reading the positive reviews.  It's a great home, in a quiet neighborhood and within walking distance of both stunning shoreline and downtown Pacific Grove.  Hop in the car and you can be at the Monterey Bay Aquarium or Carmel in a matter of minutes.  We enjoyed and master bedroom with it's renovated bathroom and the patio/koi pond.  The kitchen was well appointed and the family room was a great place to relax, watch a movie or listen to music.  Loved the fact that there were games and puzzles and ping pong available.  Lily was so welcoming -- a truly helpful person who steered us to great local eateries like Julia's (veggie and vegan) and Taste.  Be sure to hit Pavel's bakery for breakfast pastry or for lunch sandwiches -- you will be glad you did.  We are already talking about coming back for a visit in the near future.  It was hard to leave and return to the real world after such a wonderful and memorable escape.  "

We found the home to be immaculate, well furnished and just perfect for a family with young children. Downtown is a short 15 minute walk and there are tons of awesome restaurants. Lily introduced one of these to us and it's now a favorite!

I highly recommend this place and will be going back more!"
9028761,84069457,2016-07-05,6230724,Daniel,"My friends and I stayed at this beautiful place during Independence Day Weekend to visit Big Sur. There is so much to do within this house that it was a temptation to stay in instead of going out (boardgames, bbq, chiminea, basketball hoop, ect) .

This house is simply amazing. It is full of character, cozy, warm and full of sunlight thanks to the wonderful skylights in the house. Bathrooms are nice, clean, spacious and well stocked with towels and all of the amenities one would need. 

Each of the rooms have their own motifs and were great in their own respect. The garden is also one of the greatest highlights in this house, as they have a plethora of fruits and veggies, herbs, and flowers all through out the property. You have to make sure to keep the gates closed in order to keep out the beautiful deer that frequently stroll around the neighborhood out! Our group saw a pack of deer with their young ones and that was a experience in and of itself!!! 

Everything is stocked and well equipped, and this home truly feels like a home away from home. We used the brand new chiminea that was available for us which made a great hangout and conversation area for our friends at nighttimes. 

Lastly but most definitely not least, Lily has to be one of the most amazing AirBNB hostesses around. Ive stayed in about 12 rentals in my blooming career as a traveller, and by far Lily has them all beat. She is warm, friendly, sweet, caring and super awesome! She is willing to hear your concerns and find ways to make sure things work out! 

We would love to stay at this property again when we come back to Monterey/Pacific Beach/ Big Sur. 

Thanks Lily for everything!!! 

--Daniel

The property is bright, tidy, quiet, and was very comfortable for our family.  I walked to the beach several times during our stay and it is only a little longer walk to the shops and restaurants and short drive to the Monterey Aquarium and Wharf.  Lily was there to meet us and made herself available for any needs during our stay.  I hope we can visit again in the future."

Lily was warm, sweet, and so helpful to us. The house was equipped with everything we needed- plenty of bathroom amenities, kitchenware for cooking, tons of living space for the large crowd, etc. The cool garage, pond, movies and games, basketball hoop, and fire pit just made the house even extra special! There were tons of instructions of the house and recommendations for the area around the house. Given our large group size and small kids, Lily went the extra mile to share with us more family-friendly restaurants in the area. She was communicative before, during, and after our stay. We truly appreciate the charming house and warm hospitality from Lily.   "

Helaas konden we maar 1 nacht blijven maar wat hadden we graag langer kunnen genieten van de omgeving en het huis. Je voelt je zo welkom! Aan alles is gedacht. Heerlijke ruimten, een echt gezellig familiehuis met alles erop en eraan. Basketballen, tafeltennissen, muziek maken, vuurtje stoken. Alles kan!
De host heeft er alles aan gedaan om het comfortabel te maken en je de weg te wijzen in de omgeving.

De 17 Mile Drive start letterlijk om de hoek. Echte aanrader!"

She was always available on the phone to answer our queries and gave us great suggestions of the view points and the beaches. The house is way better than the pictures and I would definitely come back here again. We really enjoyed the fire pit in the backyard, it has beautiful garden too. The house is very well furnished and we loved the decor as well. The house has plenty of parking space which is a very important factor as well."

I was staying with family for one night after proposing to my (now) fiancée and this was the perfect place for us all to celebrate the night.  As a host Lily was very responsive and went out of her way to call her contacts and make dinner reservations for us.  First time using airbnb, definitely won't be the last!  Won't be the last time staying here either!  Perfect!  "

The house is very charming and has a lot of fun elements - musical instruments, board games, movies to watch, basket ball hoop and a ping pong table! It was a home in its true sense. It was also very close to restaurants and other stores, very conveniently located, which is an absolutely necessity especially when you have little children in the group. Lily was an wonderful host, one of the best I have seen thus far! She was very warm, responsive and did everything she could to make our stay comfortable. She even gave us recommendations of things to do around, bars to hang out in, restaurants to eat at. The next time I am in the Monterey - Carmel - Pacific Grove area, I will definitely stay here again! I couldn't get to meet Lily this time though, I hope to meet her the next!"
9028761,107490293,2016-10-10,34775084,Jacquelyn,"Lily was amazing in her enthusiasm for our stay, and provided so many wonderful tips and insights to the area (don't miss the Scottish Piper).  Our party of four came together in this idyllic spot for a girl's getaway.  The first evening sitting on the patio with our wine set the pace for a wonderful time with good friends, in a beautiful home that has soul and love and caring in every corner."
9028761,109299002,2016-10-20,12014435,Glen,"Not just a house, but a real home. The perfect place for an overnight stay on a road trip with 4 young children. The kids especially loved the box of musical instruments!"
9028761,109983852,2016-10-23,43231722,Florencia,"House was great, it had all what a family house would have. Lot's of great music instruments. Our stay was great and host was very helpfull. The only negative for us as we went only for a weekend is that the check out time is way too early @11.00am. When you go for the weekend you expect to enjoy Sunday as well as a day in that beautiful spot. But rather than that it was great!

Scott had every single thing in the house meticulously prepared for our arrival and our group couldnt have been happier. The backyard is a heaven on its own : beautiful garden and a chimney to huddle around at night under the starry sky; plus the ping pong table in the garage with a record player just tops it off.
Our only regret was not booking an extra night :("

Everything was just as described and Scott was a great host - super responsive answering all of our questions and making sure we had everything we needed.

I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious and well-equipped the house was.  We arrived to a beautifully clean house, fresh-cut flowers from the garden, and a personal welcome note.  We didn't need to dash out for any supplies...  everything was there from olive oil and coffee to shampoo and toilet paper.  

Our extended family was staying at Asilomar.  It was a pleasant walk to join them.  Grocery stores were five minutes away and downtown Pacific Grove was a ten minute drive.   The neighborhood was quiet, the gardens are beautiful, and the ping-pong table was a big hit with our kids!  All around, we had a great stay at Scott's house."
9028761,176386879,2017-07-30,132560310,Lee,We are a family with four adult kids and it was ideal.  Very different from the typical rental because of all the special touches. Beautiful and homey beach - garden decor with indoor outdoor spaces.  Fun to sit outside around the fireplace and roast marshmallows. Closet full of board games - we loved Balderdash. Walk to beaches in two directions. Easy drive to Cannery Row.
9028761,178989917,2017-08-06,26293004,Mark,Charming family home. In a peaceful residential area ideal for accessing the whole peninsular. We hired bikes for or stay which was well worth it. Would definitely recommend to our friends.

The cottage itself was in great condition, had perfect decor for a stylish beach cottage, and was walking distance to all of the amenities in Pacific Grove (e.g., shops, restaurants and most importantly the ocean views!). We particularly enjoyed the gas fireplace. Our hosts Tom and Laurence were very responsive and a pleasure to deal with. Highly recommend and hope to be back soon!!!"

9217124,60087505,2016-01-18,1339383,Jared,"Kate's Beach Cottage is a great location! A hop skip and a jump from the beach, short peaceful walk to downtown, Monterey, very clean and warm/inviting home with a fire place, fire pit, and a healthy assortment of cooking utensils (if you're so inclined). The welcome basket and tickets to the Monterey Bay Aquarium were a very nice touch. I will be bookmarking this place for the next time I'm in the area."
9217124,61674232,2016-02-07,9095011,Patrick,"We really enjoyed staying at Tom and Laurence's place. The thing we liked the most about is its location. Within walking distance you will find many good restaurants, lover's point park and monterey bay aquarium. It could save you parking fee and aquarium entrance fee(up to 2 guests).  The house is clean, conformable and fits perfectly for up to 5 people. We will absolutely booked again if we come back to monterey. "
9217124,62393157,2016-02-14,55428956,Christopher,"The house was perfect Pacific Grove.  A couple blocks from the beach, the sound of the ocean and scent of salt air were always present.  Old and original and yet modern and new.  Freshly painted hardwood floors and comfortable furnishing and decorations were combined with completely updated electricals, bathroom, kitchen and even a gas grill and patio firepit.
I haven't been to the Monterey Peninsula for 25 years; I'll be back again soon.  
The house was perfect and more than I expected.  "

9217124,63622144,2016-02-25,19265678,Alexander,"Cozy beach cottage in the heart of Pacific Grove. A great community to stay in for trips to Monterey Bay. The place was perfect for our family trip, 4 adults and 2 toddlers. Clean and comfortable, with all the amenities. Felt very at home. Would defiantly stay here again."
9217124,63898282,2016-02-28,29600010,Sonia,"We had a great time at Kate's cottage.  It was comfortable for all of us,  and very well set up.  The location was perfect, a few minutes walk to restaurants and shops, and three short blocks to the ocean. Our hosts were very responsive when we had questions.  

We highly recommend Kate's cottage, and would book again if we are in the area."
9217124,64268848,2016-03-01,27786940,Sue,"Just perfect. Lovely house, much better than the pictures on he website in my opinion. Bikes to borrow, which we did, cozy gas fire.  Lovely kitchenware and good quality knives.  Would love to come back. "
9217124,64637788,2016-03-06,53859846,Meagan,"Kate's Beach Cottage was the perfect destination for our girls' weekend. It was the ideal location: just around the corner from cute restaurants and shops, walking distance from the beach and Cannery Row, a short drive away from Point Lobos and Carmel. It was a very cozy stay and extremely convenient. The kitchen had all the appliances we needed. It was fantastic to have the two Aquarium passes. Tom was incredibly accomodating and detail-oriented, including a welcome basket when we arrived. "
9217124,65804176,2016-03-17,16440056,Matthew,"This was a very nice cozy cottage.  Tom and Laurence had four bikes for our use, kayaks (which we didn't use... no time), and passes to the aquarium (worth about $70 in saved admission charges!).  The setting is gorgeous, just down the road from crashing waves and a nice waterfront walkway, and a short bike ride away from Cannery Row and the aquarium."
9217124,66030198,2016-03-19,7737109,Alana,"Great stay at Kate's cottage. Couldn't of asked for a better spot to enjoy Monterey! 
Highly recommend this place and would happily stay here again. 
Really accommodating hosts and on hand for any questions during stay. 
Will be back! "
9217124,66439094,2016-03-22,58171812,Beth,"Amazing!!! Loved everything about the house. It was charming and welcoming. Stayed here with my family for a few days over spring break. Loved how close we were to restaurants, the beach and attractions. Thanks for use of the bikes and the aquarium tix! 
Would definitely stay here again. Tom and Laurence are terrific hosts. My family gave it thumbs up!"
9217124,67404585,2016-03-29,30724604,Kate,"This cottage is all we could have hoped for and more! The pictures do not do it justice, it is even better. We instantly felt at home.
Tom & Laurence had fresh flowers and a welcome basket, including aquarium passes, on the table when we arrived. 
The location was perfect. We were within an easy walk to just about  everything in Monterey and took full advantage of it. 
The cottage itself was so well appointed, they thought of everything. We spent a lot of time on the deck, and after the sun went down, inside by the fire playing the games they thoughtfully provided.  The beds are comfortable, kitchen had everything we needed, hooks are handy everywhere, throws for a chilly night, even a washer and dryer. 
All of us just loved our stay at Kate's Beach Cottage and would happily stay there again if we are in the area. 
"
9217124,68261226,2016-04-03,65079050,Ramnik,"Let me start by saying that overall we had a great time at Kate's Beach cottage.

This was our very first trip with Airbnb. We saw Kate's Beach cottage as a perfect place to crash for the night. With little kids, renting a whole house for our stay made sense.

We arrived to find a very clean, neat place with everything that you require in a house on a trip. Unfortunately we found out that the water heater wasn't working. Tom promptly came over and tried to fix it. As he couldn't fix it he got it replaced the next day. Tom acknowledged the inconvenience it caused us and gave us partial refund.

We had a wonderful rest of our stay there and would love to stay there again when we plan another trip to the area."
9217124,68315758,2016-04-04,54516142,Matthew,"What an amazing place, the pictures on here really do not do it justice. We were short walk from everything we wanted to see and the addition of the aquarium tickets was a really nice touch, great place. We arrived with a family of 4 and there is more than enough room for us all, so much nicer having some space to eat, drink and chat.
I would definitely stay again next time we are in Monterey."
9217124,68920285,2016-04-07,20211945,Carol,"We had a wonderful time at the cottage.  The neighbor hood is quiet and very clean.  The 5 bikes were perfect, we never used our car!  We biked to the aquarium, walked to the grocery store and the beach.  The cottage was just right for us.  Could have used a few more hooks to hang clothes.  Back deck fire pit was our go to evening retreat.  Beds were super comfy and high quality bedding made us feel like we were home.  
Kitchen was well equipped , another chair for the dining table would have been nice, maybe a folding one as we had 5 people and there were only 4 chairs .  There was a lot of  broken glass on the drive way and stepping stones which we had to sweep up.
Loved having the washer and dryer next to the bathroom, coming home with clean clothes is a plus . 
We would recommend the cottage and would come back again."
9217124,69970107,2016-04-15,118583,Ruth,"This is a beautiful historic home, comfortable and well decorated. It is very close to the main strip, the beach, and walking distance to the aquarium. We would stay here again!"
9217124,70467533,2016-04-18,42240480,Scott,"This place was outstanding. The attention to detail really made for a relaxing getaway. It is clear that the owners recently spent a lot of time and energy renovating the house. The recent upgrades were done in a way that contributes to the historic character of the home, yet provides modern amenities. The location can't be beat, an easy walk to both downtown PG, the aquarium and Lover's Beach. We hope to stay here again."
9217124,71436815,2016-04-25,35038990,Jessica,We had a great time in Monterey/Pacific Grove at Kate's Beach Cottage. The house was larger than we expected and fit our group perfectly. The house had everything we needed including cozy duvets on the beds and a wonderful fireplace mmm. We also took advantage of the bikes to get around Monterey.
9217124,73997199,2016-05-12,53969147,Kevin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Tom & Laurence's Beach Cottage.  It was decorated to a high standard and made us feel that we were right by the ocean.  They had thought of everything in terms of equipment, soap, toiletries etc.  Plus the washing machine, the outdoor fire basket and table, use of cycles and of course, the tickets to the aquarium. It was a really homely property and very relaxing to be in."

The location was convenient for the beach, the aquarium (tickets included), and the grocery store. We enjoyed the lovely grill on the patio and the bikes in the garage. "
9217124,77103294,2016-05-30,6453407,Rich,"I have been using Airbnb for a few years and this experience was one of the best if not the best. Incredible attention to detail, meticulously clean (not a spec of dust or dirt even on the outside deck). Then there were extras like a welcome basket, travel size bathroom items (toothpaste, etc.), condiments, multiple choices of ways to brew coffee, coffee. Perfectly furnished and located. Then there were large extras like 2 member passes to the Monterey aquarium (no line + $100 value for each day used), bicycles, kayaks. Everything the same perfect condition and meticulously clean. 
Only regret from the weekend is we never made it to using the kayaks."
9217124,78835826,2016-06-09,63977813,Gesine,"Kate' s Beach cottage is a jewel for staying in Pacific Grove. 

Everything was there to feel warm welcome. the atmosphere in the House was awesome. each detail, the design,the clean white bath, all the nice little items for a great stay..the lindor choclet. 

We stayed there as family with our little son & our grandparents & we will remember a great time!

9217124,80178668,2016-06-16,64249848,Megan,"I travelled to California with my 2 kids (5yo & 2yo) and knew I wanted to take them to Monterey for the week. We've rented a few places in Monterey before but Kate's cottage has been our favorite thus far!!! It's gorgeous. The pictures didn't do this place justice!! It was immaculate, recently renovated and extremely comfortable. It was all the little things they thought of to help you feel at home(coffee, tea, creamer, shave gel,shampoo, conditioner, jam, chocolate, laundry soap...ect) Not to mention the value of the Monterey guest passes that we used every day!!! I loved how close it was to the OCEAN, aquarium, shopping, yummy places to eat and a wonderful coffee shop right around the corner. It made it so convenient for the kids and I to grab a coffee & our breakfast to go, walk to the beach to enjoy it with sand beneath our toes. My parents also came a few days and the house easily accommodated all of us. 
They've just done a wonderful job making this such a comfortable and beautiful place to relax & enjoy Monterey.  We hope to be back next year!!!

9217124,83003831,2016-06-30,25823672,Todd And Lisa,"We had a wonderful stay at Kate's Cottage. The place was cozy, spotless and very well appointed. Tom was very accommodating of our request to access the aquarium tickets before our check-in time.  We rode the provided bikes all over town.  We couldn't have asked for a better first time Airbnb experience. "
9217124,85864737,2016-07-13,30220756,John,"What a fabulous cottage pretty located in Pacific grove.  The cottage is small but was perfect for us - a family of four. Very comfortable beds, lovely linen, a very well equipped kitchen, kayaks and bikes to use. Highly recommended. "

Thank you!"
9217124,91317455,2016-08-04,54534866,David,"This cottage is fabulous. We stayed for 4 days and it was like a home from home. It's quite small but had more than enough space for the 4 of us (3 of whom are 6 ft plus).
It is exceptionally clean and well equipped and has loads of character. I would recommend staying here without hesitation. Extra bonus is the cottage is close to good restaurants and cafes."

Would highly recommend staying."
9217124,99358597,2016-09-04,30700239,Simon,"We had a fantastic 2 night stay at Kate's Beach Cottage, it's a beautiful holiday home in a great location close to the sea and the Lighthouse Road shops and restaurants. The house is very nicely furnished and appointed, it was really cosy to stay in. 

Although Tom and Laurance couldn't be present when we checked in they provided everything we needed and were in regular contact over the weekend, which was much appreciated. 

It's a lovely house and I'd definitely stay there again, or indeed any other property of Tom and Laurence's. Many thanks for a fantastic weekend."
9217124,100118051,2016-09-07,215588,Caleb,"Tom And Laurence's cottage is an amazing place to stay. There's ample amounts of restaurants and shops nearby to fill a full day's worth of entertainment. Its centralized location was a boon for walking to/from the waterfront and Lover's Point.

The rooms were immaculately clean and the kitchen was fully stocked for any amount of cooking that you might perform. The bathroom had a nice shower with soap/shampoo/conditioner and fluffy towels. There were nice details like the archway into the kitchen and the fireplace that really lent a coziness to the the space. Definitely recommended!"
9217124,100505033,2016-09-09,92794196,Jonathan,"Kate's Cottage in Pacific Grove is a perfectly quaint, quiet, and cozy little cottage just two blocks from the Pacific.  The space was a great fit for our family of five, was spotlessly clean, and had more to offer than just the seaside feel. The addition of kayaks, bikes, and passes to the Monterey aquarium were awesome perks and made our trip more than memorable.  If we are ever in the area again this is definitely a place we will return."
9217124,101367309,2016-09-12,62337962,Mary,"Great host.  Stayed in contact via email with very specific directions once we arrived, knew just what to do.  Beautiful decor and was one of the best kitchens I've been in, had everything."

9217124,103534334,2016-09-23,54180677,Debbie,"What a really great house for our time in Monterey. Just a couple minutes walk from Lovers Point, a nice 30 minute stroll along the ocean front to The Cannery and then a little further into Fisherman's Wharf. 

The cottage itself has everything you could need, they have thought of everything. Very clean and tidy. The outside decking area is lovely with the fire in the middle, we were lucky enough to see two raccoons come and say hello when we were sitting having a wine over dinner. Couldn't have asked for more! "
9217124,104516013,2016-09-26,831356,Laurie,"We stayed at Kate's Beach Cottage in Pacific Grove for four nights for a family wedding and it was perfect in every way! Tom and Laurence are ideal hosts who have thought of everything from the tasteful decor to all the amenities. We enjoyed the fire pit and Weber grill for a family bbq. The quiet and sea air, close proximity to the beach and Monterey made this a wonderful, relaxing getaway. Can't wait to go back!  "
9217124,105174566,2016-09-30,2259702,Seung,"Great communication from the start, and very clear instructions on how to check in.  Excellent location in the heart of Pacific Grove (1 block away from a coffee shop, and easy 2 blocks away from the Ocean View avenue and Lover's Pt).  As soon as we walked in, we're impressed by its beautiful decoration and ambience.  My wife exclaimed ""I love this place"" about 3 times in 5 minutes.  Beds were comfortable, and kitchen had all the amenities and utensils we needed for quick dinner preps.  Did not use the BBQ grill, but looked good as well (nice outside sitting area).  Did not use the bikes and kayaks, but they looked like they are in good shape as well.  Finally we used complementary 2 guest passes to the aquarium 2 times, thus saving us money.  Overall, we had a wonderful stay!"
9217124,105775214,2016-10-02,20335929,Stuart,We just had the most enjoyable weekend here. Such a fantastic place - excellent hosts and great location. We particularly enjoyed the space and layout of the house - breakfast in the sun on back patio - use of the bikes in the garage and a kayak on the bay (also at the house). This was our first Airbnb experience and way exceeded expectations. Thank you very much Tom and Laurence.
9217124,107973860,2016-10-13,64427478,Jason,"Kate's Cottage is perfect. The decor, cleanliness and location make it perfect for your next getaway. We definitely suggest staying here for your next vacation. "
9217124,110814615,2016-10-28,97661438,Claire,"Kate's Cottage was perfect for our family of four. The cottage was even cuter than the pictures and super comfortable. We really enjoyed walking along Lighthouse and down to Lover's Point, both of which were easy strolls even for our 3 year-old. The aquarium passes were a huge perk. 
I highly recommend this cottage for a stay in Pacific Grove."
9217124,111396029,2016-10-31,16142108,Morgan,"There is not one thing to complain about here. We absolutely loved staying at this beach cottage, there were so many wonderful things to enjoy. The location is perfect, walking distance to nearly everything. To get to Lover's Point, the lovely walking/biking trail, the aquarium we didn't get in our car at all. We loved being able to bike along the beach (bikes provided by host) and then come home and sit out by the fire on the patio. We LOVED our time here and already want to return. "
9217124,112085197,2016-11-04,30691875,Melissa,They were so helpful in our planning and offered great advice (we stayed over Halloween with children). The cottage was lovely - decorated to a really high standard with lots of extra touches and really well equipped. The location is great and the use of the bikes and the canoe as well as the aquarium pass just the icing on the cake! 
9217124,112585289,2016-11-06,11966784,Christine,"This little house was absolutely perfect. We were in town for a wedding with my folks and one-year old daughter, and Kate's Beach house was perfect for our stay. The house is quaint and incredibly well kept, with a cute little modern kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen is well stocked and the decor is stylish and comfortable. It is just a few blocks from the ocean, and only one block from downtown Pacific Grove. We also used the Aquarium passes to take our daughter on Sunday, which was so fun! It made for the perfect weekend getaway, and was everything we needed. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. Thank you!"
9217124,112913746,2016-11-08,84044296,Wendy,What a fabulous place. It had everything we needed and more. The bikes were a great addition and it's the best way to get around. We arrived after a long haul flight and then a drive from San Francisco so we were in need of chilling out. It would have been great to have stayed longer and got better use of what the house and Monterey had to offer. 
9217124,113836850,2016-11-13,3464860,Lorraine,"We did not meet Tom and Laurence but they contacted us to make sure everything was ok.

9217124,114119043,2016-11-15,7623338,Barbara,What a wonderful place to stay in Pacific Grove!  We loved our stay and wouldn't change a thing!  Communication with Tom and Laurence was excellent and the house is perfect!  This is a perfect place to stay if you want to explore the Monterrey/Carmel/Pebble Beach area.  Be sure to add enough time to explore Pacific Grove too - it's beautiful with lots of cute shops and great restaurants!  
9217124,115071193,2016-11-21,3355156,Ron,Tom and Laurence's place was fantastic. As good or better than described in the listing. Clean and nicely equipped cottage.

The beds were comfortable, the little deck was great for relaxing, and the living room was ideal for sitting by the fireplace on a cold night. It was also great to have 4 bikes available to us. We'll have to return when it's warm enough to kayak!"

It is nice and close to the coastal trail and also to shops and restaurants. Having bikes and kayaks provided felt like a fun bonus to us.
We highly recommend this cottage.

9217124,128160930,2017-01-22,44693680,Sara,Fantastic cottage in a prime location! Stocked with all the supplies you need plus a few fun extras! A great home to come back to after a day of exploring 
9217124,129420857,2017-01-30,1170143,Omay,"I always check reviews before booking and was pleased this place had so many good ones and had many features that I look for.  
Location: Literally a 1/2 block off the main street, we easily walked to our dinner restaurants, some of us walked ""home"" for lunch, the ocean is only a couple of blocks away and there are walking paths in both directions, one morning we walked along it to the aquarium.  We also liked that the Library was only a couple of blocks away, as they are great places to buy used books these days.  And if you like second-hand shopping there are at least 5 of them in walking distance!
Cleanliness is super important and as soon as we let ourselves in we were pleased with the pleasant, clean atmosphere.  
Space:  The living room was comfortable for 2 couples.  The kitchen was easy to use for the breakfasts we made for ourselves and seating around the table for 4 of us worked well.  As you can see from the photos, one of the bedrooms is quite large and has a single bed as well as a queen, with plenty of room to spread out your stuff.  The second bedroom is quite small, which I also saw beforehand in the photos.  That smaller room requires adaptability.   I knew ahead of time from the photos that it would be challenging to get in/out of the far side of the bed and maneuvering past the sink, but decided that the other great features of the place would still make it worth it.  I hadn't realized though that there is really no place for one's luggage in that room.  I prefer to keep my clothing in my luggage, but in this case we had to unpack our things into the narrow cupboard and put our luggage back into our car.  We are pretty adaptable to small spaces, but if you aren't, you should probably look elsewhere.
One of the people in our party, complained that the shower flow was too low.  It is a very low flow, but it is warm and I am grateful for the luxury of a shower.  The shower stall is quite large and clean.
Overall we were very glad we booked this cottage and would certainly stay there again."
9217124,130400788,2017-02-05,38809755,Sofia,"This is a perfect cottage for a weekend. Very cozy, clean, nice, well (Website hidden by Airbnb) the same time it has many modern details that make the stay amazing. Tom and Laurence were great!!!

We can't say enough about how perfect it was for our family vacation.  The location is ideal, set in a homey and historic neighborhood, close to the beach and downtown.  Your cottage is spotless and appointed with everything we could possibly need during our stay.  We took advantage of the aquarium passes and had so much fun riding the bikes you provide.  We ran out of time to enjoy the kayaks but will have to return again for another visit."
9217124,138444422,2017-03-19,59980867,Keith,Kate's cottage is the place to stay.  It is so cute and homey and offers such a great place to relax after a day of exploring. It is a perfect location. It is also just around the corner from the main street  in town and only a couple blocks to the ocean.  There is a nice walkway along the water to enjoy the views.  We even saw a couple of humpbacks our first night.  We also walked to the aquarium.  You will love it there!
9217124,138979314,2017-03-22,109038340,Lisa,We had a great time! The cottage was neat as a pin & in a great location. 
9217124,140408807,2017-03-29,47113499,Geraldine,The cottage is perfect! It feels cozy and everything you need is there for you. Tom and Laurence are very reactive if any question. I would definitively go back.

9217124,143846709,2017-04-13,7921567,Layla,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tom and Laurence's cottage. The home is charming and beautifully decorated. You can tell they put great effort and care into making their place feel like a home and not a rental, and we very much appreciated it and will be back! "
9217124,144388805,2017-04-15,11944006,Halldora,"This cottage is absolutely gorgeous. It has everything you need and more. The two tickets to the Aquarium, bikes and kayaks are a great addition to your experience. Tom and Laurence are great hosts and made sure everything was running smoothly. I would definitely recommend this place when visiting Monterey. "
9217124,146850423,2017-04-23,42240480,Scott,Passes to the aquarium was a big bonus!

The hospitality was wonderful and we very much enjoyed the coffee and all amenities. The home was spotless and had everything we could possibly want including, charming motif, modern kitchen, modern bathroom (excellent shower) and comfortable beds. We look forward to returning! Sincere Regards, Russ, Yimeng & Kash! "
9217124,149751297,2017-05-05,29352678,Kc,An absolutely stunning little beach cottage. The bedrooms were very clean and the beds were extreamyly comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with all necessary cooking utensils and there was a little corner store right up the street. Bathroom was clean with a large shower fully stocked with all the bath towels as well as a few beach towels. And if you forgot anything they had a little basket with emergency toothpaste and shampoo. The back deck was wonderful with the BBQ and large warm fire pit. Not to mention the kayaks and the bicycles that were at our disposal the duration of our trip. The hosts were more than helpful and were available by phone and email with any questions we had. I am now dying to own this little beach cottage I would 10 out of 10 stay here again! 
9217124,150653795,2017-05-08,2059252,Kristin,"Our group of 4 had a lovely stay at Tom and Laurence's cottage. The location is ideal for walking (or riding) to the bike path that leads to Monterey, the aquarium, or along the coast, and only a block from Pacific Grove's main street. The cottage is nicely decorated and very clean."
9217124,151445913,2017-05-12,844571,Sarah,"Perfect in every way! Clean, cute as can be, and well stocked. Just a short walk to the beach, tide pools, seals, otters, gorgeous flowers and coastal walking paths. We had a great time and couldn't recommend it more highly!"
9217124,152460777,2017-05-16,59312102,Deedee,Great location and cozy cottage. Perfect for a weekend in Carmel and visiting the area.  We had a great trip.

9217124,160076700,2017-06-12,112957786,Carrie,"We had such a wonderful visit to Monterrey and this home was a perfect space for our family. It was on a quiet street but walkable to the coast and to stores, coffee shop etc. It was beautifully furnished and a great space for the 4 of us! It was great to be able to use the two aquarium passes as well. Thank you!"
9217124,160835286,2017-06-15,26760534,Carol,"Kate's beach cottage was a perfect stop along the Pacific Coast for my adult family of five. We road bikes out to the lone cypress and took a surfing lesson in Carmel. Both easily done from Kate's. The cottage was adorable and was conviently located to the town of Pacific Grove as well. Check in and check out was easy and, although we had little need to communicate with Tom and Laurence, they responded quickly."
9217124,161757574,2017-06-18,4112867,Corinne,Great location and very private feeling back patio. We spent a lot of time relaxing outside there in the sun. It was clean and had nice amenities. The beds were very comfortable too.

9217124,168002326,2017-07-08,5659294,Susie,"Great house in Pacific Grove. Quiet, spacious, well equipped and close to everything. We enjoyed relaxing on the back patio after a day out in nature. Close to shops and restaurants. Enjoyed use of the bikes and rode to wharf and aquarium. Wonderful, relaxing stay. Our 7th year in a row staying in Pacific Grove and definitely one of our favorite rentals. "
9217124,170448844,2017-07-15,55048684,Sandra,This is an adorable inviting home in a great location.  It accommodated our family of 5 comfortably.  The house is very clean & organized. They  thought of everything.  Coffee was delicious.  Appreciated the washer/dryer. We enjoyed using the bikes on the trail and saw seals every day. Didn't have time to use the kayaks. Loved  the deck with fire pit.  We all felt so relaxed there. Walking distance to great restaurants & movie theater.  Would definitely stay here again.
9217124,175294506,2017-07-28,34128354,Vanessa,"Clean, cosy, welcoming and fully equipped in a fab location on coast trail. Bikes are extremely useful.. meant we didn't take car! So much to do! What a great way to spend a few days or more! I would recommend this airbnb."
9217124,179020354,2017-08-06,97499047,Greig,"Totally recommend for the impeccable decor, comfy beds, gorgeous gas fire pit, along with its easy location for the beach at Lover's Point and handy cupboard essentials. Tom and Laurence are excellent hosts."

wish this were my holiday house!! Thanks so much for sharing it!!"
9217124,183182233,2017-08-16,61162581,Robyn,"This was one of the loveliest Airbnb's we have stayed in thus far. I dare say it was even lovelier than the pictures. The house was clean and very well appointed. Bathroom appeared to have been recently renovated. Kitchen was perfectly workable (I even cooked a bit!). There's a little local coffee shop around the corner as well as a market. Easily walked to the beach for sunset. We had a car and everything else was easily in driving distance. 
Recommended: il vecchio for dinner, happy girl cafe and tillie gort's for breakfast. 
Also recommended: stay here. Thank you, Tom and Laurence, for having us in your home."
9217124,188201847,2017-08-28,81671773,Helen,Kate's cottage is pefect in every way -  an architectural gem in the beautiful Pacific Grove neighbourhood. Everything has been thought of from the provision of bikes to the fantastically well equipped kitchen. We had a wonderful time and would love to return.
9217124,190179081,2017-09-03,21381193,Natalie,We had a fantastic stay at the beach house! It was perfect for the four of us and we especially enjoyed using the bikes to get to the aquarium and grilling out on the back porch. It's a lovely cottage and wished we could have stayed longer!
9217124,191501272,2017-09-07,2261452,Annabel,"Tom and Laurence's cottage was a perfect getaway. It's not big but it had everything we needed, and cozy for the five of us. They have a great BBQ set up on the back porch and we spent three of the two nights barbecuing, star seeing and suspecting if that was an actual owl on the roof top. The two membership tickets to the aquarium was a big plus because tickets are expensive there. Side note: we chose spontaneously to go to the aquarium by foot which turned out to be a very pleasant walk by the ocean. For anyone who is not familiar with the area, the house is perfectly located within distance to everything. Overall we had a great time there and will recommend to others looking to stay."
9217124,192031480,2017-09-09,33769756,Jen,"Kate's beach cottage is the perfect little house for a comfortable and relaxing stay in Pacific grove. Just a short walk away from the beach and a mile away from the aquarium we took full advantage of the bikes and kayaks available. The house was clean and well stocked with everything we needed and more, including the 2 aquarium passes which were a great addition. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting the area."
9217124,192994859,2017-09-11,79836718,Victoria,The cutest house and close to shops and the water! Will definitely have to stay here again!

The cottage is cozy and extremely well equipped - the bed is very comfortable. Wish we had had the opportunity for a longer stay, and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
9217124,200235651,2017-10-04,8699366,Suzy,We loved staying at Kate's Cottage - it is in a perfect location and very nicely decorated & thoughtfully equipped. Lots of helpful information from our hosts too.
9217124,200818026,2017-10-06,144582825,Janet,"We loved our stay at Kate's Cottage!   The location is perfect.  We were not familiar with Pacific Grove but it was a great place to stay and very close to many destinations along the North Central coast.   It was a very quiet neighborhood within walking distance to gorgeous beaches, great coffee, delicious food and the amazing aquarium.  The cottage was very clean and charming.   It is cozy but the furniture is well scaled to the size of the rooms.   We really appreciated the many extra touches by our hosts.  The bikes and aquarium passes were very thoughtful.    I would definitely recommend a stay in Kate's cottage."
9217124,201690527,2017-10-08,135311683,David,"Tom and Laurence's place is more wonderful than as described.  It was welcoming and felt homely.  We didn't want for anything, as the house has everything to aide the weary traveller that they may have forgotten.  The kitchen is well setup and the bathroom is excellent.  We could have wished for a better host, house or location for our stay.  Already planning for a future longer stay."
9217124,202520898,2017-10-11,28257965,Janice,"The cottage was exactly as shown in the pictures.  The location was excellent- only a couple blocks to the ocean and close to shops and restaurants, very walkable.  Very nice neighborhood.  The home was very clean and had everything one would need-lots of items in the kitchen, a washer & dryer- they even provide laundry soap and fabric softener if you want to do laundry.  The bikes and kayaks are a bonus and the Aquarium passes are a really nice treat.  Tom & Laurence were quick to respond to any questions.  There were no issues or problems during our stay and we would highly recommend Kate's Beach Cottage."
9217124,205272831,2017-10-21,55718615,Chris,"Tom and Laurence have impeccable taste.  Kate's Cottage (named after an original inhabitant in the late 19th century--so many of the homes on Pacific Grove pay homage to that generation of locals) is historic and yet exquisitely updated.  

Clean.  Charming.  Well kept.  Attention even to the smallest details: high quality herbal teas in a basket on the table; olive oil for cooking; all the right utensils and cooking items.  

And the location is outstanding.  A quite street, but just steps from the Carmel Coffee Roasting Company for morning coffee and a short walk to the famed Pavel's Bakerei or the movie theater or the coastal trail.  

Highly recommended!"
9217124,206102919,2017-10-23,3150392,James,"What a great place. Good location, really well stocked and excellent communication. We would go back in a heartbeat."
9217124,206511204,2017-10-25,2280277,Patricia,"Thanks again for a great stay! Everything from check-in, the lovely house and all the amenities were fantastic! Pacific Grove is very nice as well as the amazing beaches around. 
We would love to return!"
9217124,207757566,2017-10-29,10354014,Stephen,"Thanks for the amazing place to call ours for the weekend. Very stylish chic and comfortable. All four of us had a great time and enjoyed your house. Just enough space to feel like we had enough room but small enough to feel cozy on the cold mornings. Plenty of hospitality including bikes, kayaks and passes to the aquarium were made available to us!

Would come back and stay here again in a heartbeat."
9217124,208952539,2017-11-03,48352507,Jérôme,"Everything was as expected. The cottage is very clean and very cosy. The location is great and at walking distance to many restaurants and seashore. Thank you as well for the 2 aquarium pass, this was much appreciated. The second bedroom is not big but the cottage was perfect for 2 adults and two kids. Overall, it was the perfect place!"
9217124,211438368,2017-11-12,2906738,Sean,"An absolutely wonderful place to spend a long weekend in Pacific Grove! Centrally located a block from the main commercial area in one direction and Monterey Bay in the other direction, this apartment is ideal to truly walk everywhere. On the first morning we even walked to the Monterey Bay aquarium (less than a mile) with the free member passes!  Our family of five felt right at home in Tom & Laurence's cottage. Stylish & hip, the cottage is a designer's dream!  The cottage felt spacious - nice sized kitchen, living room and dining area. Outside the back door is a beautiful deck to enjoy a glass a wine around the fire table in the evenings! The beds were very comfortable and it was quiet at night, so easy to fall asleep! Many restaurants and stores were located within steps of the cottage, including a delicious bakery (Pavel's Backerie) where you can get your breakfast goodies! We also enjoyed the four bikes to tour the neighborhood & the path along the water's edge.  Tom & Laurence were gracious and kind hosts who communicated well before/during our stay and gave us fabulous recommendations in the neighborhood. Everything in Kate's cottage was well stocked and organized!  At the end of our weekend we did not want to say goodbye to the lovely Kate's cottage! Highly recommended!"

It is so central, walk around the corner for your morning coffee, walk a block or so and drink your coffee on the bay!  We rode the bikes along the bay bikepath, we went to the aquarium with the guest passes.  Truly a great weekend.   Next time we will take advantage of the fire pit in the backyard!"
9217124,221527713,2017-12-26,46370276,Isabelle,"Nous avons passé un magnifique Noël en famille chez Tom et Laurence. La maison est aussi charmante que ses propriétaires. Très propre, accueillante, cosy et très bien placée pour visiter les alentours."
9217124,222823747,2017-12-30,7187506,Dain,"Kate’s cottage is a charming home in a great neighborhood.  It was perfect for our family of four.  A short walk to the water and an even shorter walk to many cafes, restaurants, and shops.  We love Pacific Grove and will definitely stay at Kate’s cottage again on our next visit!"
9217124,225883262,2018-01-07,162410927,Kenneth,"Kate's Cottage is 5 stars all the way. It a cozy relaxing place with all the trimmings to make for a perfect home base for a family of 4 or 5. Location! Location! Location! Walking distance to Cannary Row, Monterey Bay Aquarium (15 mins ocean front trail), Lovers Point Beach, downtown Pacific Grove, and Caledonia Park.  Two passes for the Aquarium were included and greatly appreciated.  I am sure we will all have fond memories of Kate's Cottage for some time to come."

9217124,246988406,2018-03-26,29494899,Christina,"We sincerely enjoyed our stay in Pacific Grove and at Kate’s Cottage.  The space was cozy and well cared for.  Lots of local activities within walking and driving distance.  We really appreciated the quietness of the local area, but with the ability to go into Monterey or Carmel for a little more activity.  We look forward to visiting again soon."
9217124,247521705,2018-03-28,112938330,Rex,"The location is amazing.  The one mile walk on Ocean View to the aquarium was perfect.  The home is located right by a strip of shops/restaurants.  There are so many places to go within a 10 minute drive.   I am not familiar with the area so knowing I could get anywhere in 10 minutes was a relief.   Baby needed milk, boom, Trader Joe's in 8 minutes.  The kitchen comes fully stocked with dishes/pans/utensils.  I had a question for Tom and Laurence and their response was prompt.  I would recommend this place to anybody in any situation."
9217124,248156467,2018-03-30,111584567,Bart,Having bikes and kayaks available were an added amenity to help us enjoy Pacific Grove.
9217124,249084654,2018-04-01,167637500,Frances,"Park your car (in the driveway- a plus all by itself) and then you can walk to everything- the beach, the bike path, and downtown Pacific Grove (restaurants, grocery, shops). Such a great location and the cottage is equipped with everything you will need (including use of the bikes and kayaks), and was very clean."
9217124,250623671,2018-04-05,42240480,Scott,"Place has some amazing historic touches, with modern amenities."
9217124,251925080,2018-04-08,43780502,Philippa,"A perfect cottage in a perfect location. Whether it’s breakfast at The Red House Cafe, the world class aquarium, an evening at a wonderful cinema or just pizza in the back yard with the fire table warming you. (All of this is within walking distance.) This is the place! 
Thank you for letting us stay - we loved it!"
9574239,54964200,2015-11-25,23052918,Johannes,Elizabeth went out of her way to make us feel welcome. She came over to the place showed us around and told us where the locals eat. 
9574239,55863209,2015-12-06,19807945,Cathy,"We had a great stay. The house is over 100 years old and very charming. The neighborhood is quiet and an easy walk to downtown and the beach.  Elizabeth was very welcoming, making sure the house was in perfect order. I appreciate her interest in restoring the historic architecture of Pacific Grove."
9574239,57078602,2015-12-21,45245303,Prisilla,"We had a great experience! The house and neighborhood was much more lovely than we expected based on the pictures. The house is small and cozy and though over 100 years old, it doesn't feel old at all. It's really close to the ocean, Monterey and everything you'd want to visit in the area. Elizabeth was great. She wasn't quite done cleaning when we arrived but she let us start moving our things in. She offers very generous check-in and check-out times (2pm and 12pm) so we were okay with that. She also stocked the kitchen very generously. She also reassured us that everything is childproof which is very important with an active toddler. 

The only child-related, very minor inconveniences were that our son's room got very cold even with the heater on. But once we propped open the door at night, it warmed up. Also, on our last day the cable was not accessible because it was time to pay the bill. I had no idea cable companies were so aggressive about their bills! But again, these were child-related. If we were traveling alone it would not have been an issue. We'd love to visit again. "
9574239,57231033,2015-12-23,1321574,Ingrid,"Elizabeth was at the house to meet us, helped us get settled in, and gave us some great tips about what to do during our stay. The house was as described, comfortable and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our own food, including good quality pots and knives, which is rare in rentals! We appreciated the hospitality and would recommend this home for a family or two couples looking for a getaway."
9574239,57794213,2015-12-29,555610,Olga,"We loved the neighborhood, loved walking to Lovers Point and eat! The house was adorable and perfectly suited for 2 families with kids. Kitchen has Nespresso and everything to cook. Really, Elizabeth has thought of everything! We really wanted for nothing. Did a lot of cooking in the house, which was great. What we wanted was friends with kids together time and we got it. Kids loved wooden birds."
9574239,58369757,2016-01-02,26974372,Daniel,"This was a great place to stay which was enhanced by Elizabeth's gracious hospitality.  There's a combo lock on the front door which takes the pressure off having to arrive exactly on time to pick up a key.   However, Elizabeth was there to greet us and make sure we knew how everything worked.  She left a lot of goodies, highlighted by a Nespresso coffee maker which impressed us so that we want to ditch the unit we have at home in favor of this nifty machine.  The house has a lot of character and is very comfortable.  Easy to park (see photo) with a central location near to downtown Pacific Grove, ocean walking, and the Pacific Grove Golf Links which is the best golfing value in North America (back nine holes are on the ocean/bay).  Anyway, we give this home and host FIVE STARS!!  Thanks, Elizabeth!"
9574239,59761810,2016-01-15,24591922,Gale,"Elizabeth made us feel immediately welcomed and at home. She thoughtfully provided for us all that we needed, and more! The description of this listing was accurate. Her cottage is bright and appealingly furnished. The neighborhood is low-key, tidy, and easily accessible to downtown Pacific Grove, Monterey, and to Asilomar State Park."
9574239,60008819,2016-01-18,22586959,"Paula, Michael And Sweetie Pie",The house is charming and great location in PG.   The house was well stocked for cooking and breakfast makings.   Although we didn't have an opportunity to meet Elizabeth she was available as needed.  We give two thumbs up!
9574239,61002687,2016-01-30,7992125,Phyllis,"Elizabeth's House was perfect.  We were looking for a clean, comfortable, house where we could hang out and cook after a day of adventures.  We got this and so much more.  Elizabeth was a great host making sure that all of our needs were met and by providing us with the a very special place to stay. The beds were so comfortable and the linens were divine.  The kitchen was excellent with great cook ware, beautiful plates and glasses, a pantry stocked with odds and ends that you might need for cooking and all sorts of treats.  The house has magnificent natural lighting, hard wood floors and a good heater for chilly winter nights. The location was perfect a very quiet neighborhood tucked into a small street in Pacific Grove.  We could easily walk down to the ocean or take a short drive to the aquarium. 
Thank you Elizabeth, we hope we get to stay here again!!!"
9574239,61177820,2016-02-01,489749,Meryl And Rick,"Elizabeth is a great host - she met us at the cottage and gave us the rundown on the house and the area. The kitchen is marvelously stocked with food, cooking supplies, and whatever you need. The beds are amazing with plush linens and lots of pillows and blankets. Pacific Grove has a great town with awesome restuarants and it's so centrally located that you can be in Carmel, Monterrey, or Pebble Beach in just minutes. Loved everything!!"
9574239,62501244,2016-02-15,11045166,Sarah,"If you're looking for a peaceful weekend in the Big Sur area, stay here! Wow, can't say enough about how wonderful our stay was! Elizabeth met us when we arrived (though no need as she provides a door code so you can arrive whenever) and showed us around this charming house. She provided us recommendations in the area and was a wealth of information on Carmel/Monterey/Big Sur. 

The house itself was beautiful. High ceilings, light, and airy. Well kept with comfortable beds, plenty of linens, and a fully stocked kitchen (she even bought orange juice and eggs for us). Definitely check in before going food shopping because Elizabeth provided all the essentials and more. Wifi works great, the TV has a million channels, and there's a great bluetooth system for any impromptu dance parties. Monterey and Carmel are right down the street and it's a 20 minute walk to the beach which has beautiful jutting cliffs perfect for watching the sunset. It took us about an hour to get to Big Sur and we always loved returning to this home. 

Elizabeth herself was extremely responsive any time we had a question or concern. She even dropped off a bottle of wine for us to enjoy because she had some extra. Her suggestions for the area were perfect and we felt so well loved and taken care of throughout our stay. 

Would highly recommend Elizabeth and this house to anyone looking in the area! "
9574239,63578465,2016-02-24,58380395,Heather,"The cottage and Elizabeth exceeded our expectations! Even before we arrived to the home Elizabeth was very helpful with providing information about local attractions that would be suitable for our family that included a toddler. We arrived and found the house stocked full with pantry items, fresh fruit, and even foodstuffs in the refrigerator. It made us regret having grocery shopped ahead of time. Both bedrooms were equally large and able to accommodate the portable cribs for the toddlers with plenty of room to spare. Did I mention aquarium passes? I hadn't noticed that in the description when I booked, probably because we are already members, but our friends with a toddler that stayed with us were able to capitalize on two adult admissions which saved them a chunk of money. The house is also an easy walk to Asilomar Beach for great sand, tidepools, and sunsets as well as Lover's Point and nearby Pacific Grove restaurants and coffee. Speaking of coffee, the cottage has a Nespresso for grabbing a quick cup in the morning before heading out for excursions. This house was PERFECT for a family getaway with small children and can comfortably accomodate two families. I have been telling all my bay area friends that if they are looking for a cozy, quiet, relaxed getaway to the Monterey area to skip the hotels and just call up Elizabeth. "
9574239,64101002,2016-02-29,6305474,Kate,"Elizabeth was a welcoming, gracious host. We felt right at home. They house is every bit as nice as it looks. It is in a great neighborhood and close to everything. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking. I would stay here again if we come back. Great place!"
9574239,64635465,2016-03-06,15792423,Tiffany,"We had a wonderful stay at Elizabeth's historic cottage. The location is private and residential, and just a short drive to restaurants and shops in Pacific Grove and Monterey. Elizabeth was very responsive and detail oriented and ensured we had an enjoyable stay. This is a renovated cottage, so there are old features throughout the house, but it adds to the overall charm. Was perfect for us and friends for a weekend getaway."
9574239,65844406,2016-03-17,54871020,Anne,"We had a wonderful stay at Elizabeth's home!  The house was clean, comfortable, charmingly decorated and in a perfect location.  It was safe, quiet and close to amenities.  We so appreciated the full pantry, fresh fruit basket and toiletries.  Elizabeth stopped by after our arrival and was gracious, informative, warm and friendly.  We felt so welcomed and the house and Elizabeth exceeded every expectation.  Thank you for a great visit - we look forward to returning! "

9574239,66887735,2016-03-25,34456428,Lanie,We had a wonderful stay in Elizabeth's charming Pacific Grove home! The house was perfect and Elizabeth's hospitality and extra welcoming touches (milk and oj in the fridge among other things) made us feel welcome and at home.   We were delighted to spend some time with Elizabeth and her lovely daughter at the aquarium and were very appreciative of the passes they provided us!  I would definitely recommend this listing!
9574239,67142895,2016-03-27,11003221,Rachel,Very cute quaint area of Pacific Grove. We stayed when attending a wedding in Carmel and it was perfect. Great location! 
9574239,67457361,2016-03-29,57034514,Zack,"We had a fantastic stay in this rustic Pacific Grove cottage. It is located on a very private street with a small city open space one block away. Downtown PG is right down the street, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium is just a 5 minute drive away. The home was clean, and the beds were very comfortable. We settle down in the evenings and enjoyed watching Redbox movies on the huge flat screen TV. "
9574239,68165872,2016-04-02,45113871,Maria,"We spent a lovely couple of nights at Elizabeth's home. The cottage was clean, airy and cozy. The main room and the kitchen were bathing in sunlight. Perfect location and surroundings! It was a short walk to the beautiful seashore (took us 10 min), and a historic downtown. We got to see deers every time we went to the beach! Monterey and Carmel were only a short drive away. All in all, a delightful experience!"
9574239,68305603,2016-04-04,38347731,Kate,"Elizabeth's cottage was just perfect for our two night stay in Monterey.  It had everything we needed as a family of four.  Breakfast was all ready in the fridge and the larder was well stocked.  There was a Nespresso machine with a supply of pods.  Fabulously comfy beds and lots of towels and toiletries.  The whole booking process was seamless and Elizabeth lent us her Aquarium guest passes which saved us $100. 
 Two great restaurants within walking distance. Will definitely come back.  Thanks so much -10/10 "
9574239,68891806,2016-04-07,5189435,Steph,"We had a great little vacation, the house had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable and Elizabeth really helpful. She even got us passes for the aquarium! I will definitely be back!
"
9574239,69433970,2016-04-11,17214505,Amanda,"Elizabeth's historic cottage provided the perfect melding of character and comfort for our visit in California! We loved staying here and the space was amply large for two people. It had all of the charm that you could wish for with modern conveniences that impressed us. I only wish that we could have stayed even longer.

This cottage is in a great location! It was only a 10-15 minute drive to Monterey,  Carmel, and Pebble Beach. We also enjoyed walking to downtown Pacific Grove daily, which was a great way to soak up all of the picturesque architecture in the neighborhood. Only a 10 minute walk, the downtown area has a plethora of restaurants, coffee shops, and stores."
9574239,69966310,2016-04-15,9338308,Wallis,"Elizabeth and her home are wonderful!  This cottage was perfect for our small family and a lovely place to stay.  The neighborhood is quiet, convenient and charming.  We visited Monterey, Carmel and Big Sur and all were easy to get to.  Big Sur was the farthest (about 1.5 hrs away), but the drive was so beautiful the time didn't matter, even with a toddler. Elizabeth pays close attention to the details, and it makes her cottage really special.  The pantry and fridge were stocked with essentials, she brought us a bottle of wine, and she even left children's suncreen and an extra pack of baby wipes for our young daughter.  She also had two passes to the Aquarium. Elizabeth responded quickly to all our inquiries, gave us great restaurant recs and was a fabulous host.  I highly recommend this cottage to both families and couples.  You will love it, guaranteed!"
9574239,71103472,2016-04-23,41923903,Ben,"Really nice, comfortable and well-appointed home in a quiet neighborhood. An easy walk to the waterfront and shopping/dining in Pacific Grove, and a great location for anyone visiting Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel. 

We arrived to find fresh milk, oj, eggs and other basics in the fridge and a well stocked pantry - a really pleasant surprise!"
9574239,71463884,2016-04-25,30710810,Kathleen,"The house was perfect and even better than described. Lovely, quiet neighborhood, well located. The house was charming, incredibly outfitted and the beds were very comfortable. Elizabeth was great to deal with and exceptionally accommodating!"
9574239,71896236,2016-04-29,32091282,Kathy,"Elizabeth was very warm, welcoming and accomodating. She added a cute wicker set outside the house for us, so we could enjoy coffee or wine outside....and we did both. She gave us a quick tour of the house and described the little quirks that come with a 100+ year old home. The house was well equipped and stocked so it made it easy to stay-in for an easy meal if we chose to.  Darling decor, everthing was comfortable and the layout was very open.  We would recommend this house and stay there again.  Elizabeth returned calls promptly when we had questions.  Great nieghborhood!  "
9574239,72250735,2016-05-01,35633010,Swenja,Everything was as described - the cute cottage was all white with tasteful artwork on the walls; the kitchen was very well stocked and Elizabeth welcomed us with an orchid plant in her hands. Would definitely recommend!
9574239,73595951,2016-05-08,71412,Nicolas,"The place is exactly as it can be seen on the pictures.
I didn't meet Elizabeth personally. Though we handle the check in/out by emails  everything went really really smooth.
I told Elizabeth that I would arrive at a certain time and when we arrived we found the house lit on with the TV on which gave a home sweet home feeling (environmentalist folks keep calm :)).
Elizabeth had left some fruits and drinks which is a nice touch.
2 passes for the Aquarium are also available.
Initially we didn't plan to go to the Aquarium but went 1 hour before it closed since the passes provided free admission. 
Great place to stay.
I would recommend it to my friends and definitely go back."
9574239,74401895,2016-05-15,12729040,Elizabeth,Cute home! Host was very helpful! Would stay here again if in the area!

Buena cocina, dormitorios y bien ubicado. Falta mejorar la limpieza (vimos algunas spiders) y cuidar mas el jardin. Resolviendo lo mencionado esta casa seria perfecta. 
Muchas gracias Elizabeth por tu hospitalidad y recomendaremos tu casa."

Elizabeth was great with communicating with me during the booking and prior to our arrival.  She was present at the house when we arrived and gave us a quick your.  She also stocked the fridge win breakfast food which was very appreciated.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and close to the beach, restaurants, and shops.  I would highly recommend staying at Elizabeth's house.  "
9574239,77913393,2016-06-04,846159,Stephanie,"Our stay at Elizabeth's adorable Pacific Grove house was amazing.  By far, the best Air BnB experience we've ever had.  Elizabeth went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.  First of all, the house is very well stocked with all the convinces of home, from the kitchen to the bathroom. We did not need to run to the store for anything.  The kitchen has any tool you might need and a pantry full of food and condiments making cooking at home really convenient.   Elizabeth left a huge bowl of fruit on the kitchen table, which we took advantage of and enjoyed all weekend, even utilizing the juicer to make fresh squeezed OJ for breakfast.  The house was big enough for our two families to share, each of us with one small child, and a huge bonus is that it is within walking distance to Lovers Point Beach and the Aquarium (which takes about an hour walk round trip and is so gorgeous by the ocean).  Not too far the other way there is also a playground for the kiddos and the neighborhood feels very safe, charming and quiet.  Elizabeth was very friendly, responsive and accommodating.  We will definitely be back! "
9574239,78992817,2016-06-10,47322565,Turner,"We had an excellent stay at Elizabeth's house!  Four of us stayed there for three nights and could not have asked for anything better.  We were close to Cannery Row, the Aquarium, 17 Mile Dr, and Carmel by the Sea.  The house has everything you need for a stay in Monterey!"
9574239,79673908,2016-06-13,16529920,Jennifer,"This was a wonderful experience, just as good or even better than the airbnb description. The house is lovely, and in an old quiet neighbourhood. Elizabeth had left us food and wine, which we very much appreciated when we arrived in, she called in with tickets for the aquarium, and was so helpful. We were parents and adult children all with different needs and interests,a nd we all loved the house and the neighbourhood. First day we walked down to the sea, seeing deer on the way, second day we went whale watching and to the aquarium, and third day drove to Big Sur. Elizabeth had left enough coffee for all of us and eggs and fruit and juice, and we appreciated it all.
This is not the cheapest airbnb but it is really worthwhile, and well worth the price. The house has  a good atmosphere, and its a good experience that left us feeling positive.  "
9574239,80040446,2016-06-15,5696047,Lindsay,"Elizabeth's home was cozy and we appreciated all of the amenities including fresh fruit, milk, and eggs left for us by the host. The location was great and close to the restaurants and cute town of Pacific Grove and of course the amazing aquarium. When we had trouble getting the TV to work, Elizabeth was over in a heartbeat and fixed the problem within minutes. We would definitely stay here again if in the area."

We loved staying here!"

Location incredible - 10 mins to everything including the Monterrey Aquarium.  Tom was a perfect host, supremely knowledgeable about the area.  We hated to leave.  Heartily recommend!  Thank you Biz and Tom.

9574239,82220052,2016-06-26,54271815,Kathryn,"Elizabeth and Tom's place is charming and perfect for a stay in Pacific Grove.  We were a family of four and there was ample space for us.  My oldest teenaged daughter would like to move here for an entire summer and rent the place herself  (She SAYS she would find a job) The home has all the essentials and more.  The washer and dryer were great as we were traveling to various points along the coast.  You can see all the time and effort Elizabeth and Tom have put into this home - very well planned out and then there are all the extra little touches.  Elizabeth was away so Tom met us with some eggs and juice, and he took the time to sit down and talk to us about the area. He even drew a map for us for a particular walk to take. Much appreciated as were the the extra passes to the aquarium!  I would highly recommend this home for a stop or for an extended stay!  It would be a perfect spot to stay in to really get to know the area - which has so much to offer and see!  A perfect home away from home!"
9574239,84164192,2016-07-05,46342844,Judy,Everything was amazing. This cottage was the perfect place for our daughter to get ready before her wedding. It is charming and very comfortable. Elizabeth greeted us on arrival and was very informative on all the home's accessories. She went out of her way to make sure we had a wonderful stay.  We would like to come back here every year.
9574239,84722111,2016-07-08,30384212,Nicole,"This is a very special home and quite a deal in our opinion. Elizabeth has stocked the house beautifully and everything is well kept. We actually loved her coffee machine so much we came home and bought one for ourselves. If you are walkers, this is an ideal place! We brought our stroller and walked to the main strip in PG for meals and fun! The neighborhood is quiet and inviting. We have recommended this place to all our friends, it has great energy and with the aquarium passes you cannot beat it for the price! Very family friendly, we had enough space and were comfortable with our little ones. Look no further, you will love this house and your experience with Elizabeth! "
9574239,85161073,2016-07-10,52728231,Kathy,"This house was amazing and Elizabeth made things so easy! I booked this house t stay for my wedding weekend and the vintage look fit so well for pictures!

9574239,87722142,2016-07-21,55259929,Paul,We really enjoyed our stay here.  The cottage has a really nice vibe and you feel at home almost immediately.  The beds were super comfortable and cosy and the kitchen is probably better stocked than your own. The hosts very kindly left us some supplies and even borrowed 2 extra aquarium passes so all 4 of us could go. The neighborhood is very attractive and quiet and we wouldn't hesitate recommending it as a great place to stay.
9574239,88501784,2016-07-24,35026586,Juli,"Quiet, cozy neighborhood with easy access to downtown Pacific Grove and the ocean. The house was super cute and extremely well stocked and organized. Elizabeth obviously goes above and beyond to make sure that her guests have an incredible experience."

It's a quaint cottage in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood perfect for kids tooling around on bikes and scooters, and close enough to everything you'd want to do in the area with a few minutes' drive. Elizabeth was prompt and helpful with a minor hiccup, and got us access to the Aquarium with guest passes - a huge value. "
9574239,92956367,2016-08-10,18025735,Rob,The house was perfect and had everything you could wish for. We stayed with two young children and they had a great time in the front yard.

The cottage is located in a quiet and safe residential area and perfectly positioned in walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove with nice cafes and restaurants. Carmel, Monterey  and HW #1 are easily accessible (by car, needless to say). The house is lovingly renovated, perfectly equipped and clean. Elisabeth even provided more than essential food and household equipment. A perfect accommodation, highly recommended!"

9574239,102948008,2016-09-19,23298199,A,"Elizabeth was there to meet us, and made us feel at home immediately.  To say the larder and fridge was stocked would be an understatement!!  We could have eaten for a fortnight with the food that was there - and every detail had been catered for (e.g. more herbs than you could find in some supermarkets).  The place had a real feel of being a ""home"" rather than just a rental.  Pacific Grove has a lovely feel to it as a town, and this cottage has a real authentic feel to it too.  The road is quiet, and there was nothing that we could have asked for that was not provided.  We would definitely stay again, given the opportunity!!"
9574239,103285891,2016-09-21,13894916,Isaac,"One of our best travel experiences!  Pacific Grove is a wonderful preserved old town.

Elisabeth had very generously left supplies for us to use in the kitchen.
A truly enjoyable and comfortable stay perfect to explore Big Sur and the salinas valley.
Thank you Elisabeth"
9574239,105719028,2016-10-02,1667512,Lucy,"We spent a weekend at Elizabeth's cottage with 3 adults and an infant and absolutely loved it. The house is exceptionally cozy and well-equipped - and it's in such a quaint location. It was so easy for us to walk everywhere - even to the Monterey Aquarium. Elizabeth was very welcoming, too and checked in with us by email after we arrived. Would definitely stay there again!"
9574239,106706564,2016-10-07,81711441,Lisa,"Our stay at Elizabeth's home was wonderful.  The location is in a quiet neighborhood but very close to all attractions and amenities. Walking distance to some and minutes drive to others.  Her home is well stocked with everything you need including an amazing kitchen!  With a quick trip to the grocery store, we were able to relax and prepare meals in her home while planning meals out to many of the wonderful local restaurants in the area. Elizabeth gave us some great recommendations to local restaurants.  The aquarium passes were very much appreciated.  Elizabeth's directions and access to the home were easy and she also stopped by to drop off more coffee!  Pacific Grove is such a beautiful community and we would definitely stay here on our next visit to the peninsula. "

9574239,109281601,2016-10-20,55299203,Laurie,"This is a charming older cottage in a lovely and quiet neighborhood.  It is close to everything within several blocks. Elizabeth was very sweet in providing fresh eggs, tangerine juice, milk, and 1/2 & 1/2; plus fresh bananas and citrus.  Our beds were very comfortable and cozy.  I was a little worried my 89 yr old mother might get chilled but the heater works very well.  One note is that Mom could not safely get into the claw-foot bathtub/shower and a rubber bath mat would be a great addition for safety.  All in all it was just great!"
9574239,110146367,2016-10-24,9826829,Fabienne Et Fabrice,The house was exactly as described. It was very pleasant to find everything you need ! Elizabeth was very welcoming ! I would definitely recommend the place!

We especially loved the neighborhood- walking distance to parks, quaint downtown PG, the coastal trail and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  While we did not get to meet Elizabeth in person she graciously provided two aquarium passes for our stay and was responsive and communicated frequently throughout our stay."
9574239,113999754,2016-11-14,1306729,Ashley,"Elizabeth's house is beautiful! If you want to really feel like you're experiencing what it would be like to live in Pacific Grove, her place is a good choice. The house feels very authentic and historic yet is in great shape. Elizabeth is a very good host and made sure we had everything we needed and responded quickly. Highly recommended!!"
9574239,114334464,2016-11-17,10493835,Geraldine,"Elizabeth's cottage was a wonderfully peaceful haven, truly quiet and pacific. Arrival was a breeze. Decor is pleasant and fun but not overdone. The beds are super comfortable and the heating is very cozy. Shower bath is a delightful experience. She was exceptionally generous in stocking the kitchen both with equipment and staples. Convenient location for walking or going out to dine etc. and beautifully tucked away on a lovely little street. We would happily return. Highly recommend!"

9574239,117075295,2016-12-04,12884354,Hana,"Elizabeth was a great host and her home was perfect for a weekend business trip. The little details were what made this house so special -- a bottle of wine waiting for us on the kitchen table, fresh fruit, and four aquarium guest passes to accommodate our whole group. Elizabeth was out of town, but her sister Mary stopped by to make sure we were ok. Mary also allowed us to check out in the afternoon so we could visit the aquarium in the morning. Thank you both for your wonderful hospitality!"
9574239,121746420,2016-12-18,103453937,Branda,This was a Great place to stay. A beautiful quaint cottage. Only a few miles from everything. I definitely recommend this.
9574239,123530245,2016-12-29,34210132,Leah,"Our stay at Elizabeth's cottage was perfect. Firstly two comfy queen size beds, plenty of pillows and blankets, and a toasty furnace for the cold nights. We enjoyed the cozy cottage, nice big t.v., and a fully stocked kitchen with a large variety of condiments to help us prepare a tasty meal. We loved the large old fashion claw foot tub, with lots of hot water. It was easy to check in and out, the cottage is in a great location close to everything and a quiet safe neighborhood. Thank you Elizabeth we hope to come back again on our next trip! "
9574239,124884688,2017-01-02,31704496,Nick,"This is a lovely house in a nice street, close to amenities (including the cinema), the sea and Monterey. The facilities in the house were plentiful – we cooked at home – and the beds were very comfortable. The shower might have been invented by Heath Robinson, but was fun to work out. Elizabeth couldn't have been a better host, even checking out whether local shops and restaurants would be open over the new year period. One great bonus was the passes to the aquarium on Cannery Row. I don't usually have a big thing for these, but the one in Monterey is special and well worth a morning at least."
9574239,127364014,2017-01-17,79633042,Haoqin,The house is so lovely! And it's location is definitely great. It is so sweet for the landlord to put cards for aquarium which is amazing for guests!

She provided us with a fire log,  a bottle of wine and fresh fruit in addition to a VERY well stocked refrigerator and pantry.    She also provided us with 4 passes to the aquarium, which was an added plus.  Her place is a brisk walk down to a nice beach, and  close to the embarcadero. This is a nice place to revisit.  "

9574239,136275896,2017-03-09,8614131,Elise,"Elizabeth's cottage is in the charming neighborhood of Pacific Grove, which ended up being our favorite part of our tour of Highway 1. The neighborhood is historic and lovely, the cottage preserves all its old charm, has a wonderfully loose cottage garden, and was amply stocked with more provisions than we could have ever hoped for. Elizabeth is kind and accommodating. There's a great park a block a way, spectacular sunsets on the state beach, and great local food to cook. This was my most perfect Airbnb experience-- I need old windows, white sheets, a porcelain clawfoot tub, and a well-stocked kitchen to relax. I couldn't have been happier -- we look forward to spending more time in this lovely spot in the future!"

Elizabeth has made this place super comfy and efficient. Stayed here when attending a conference at Asilomar to have a more private and relaxing housing option. I had some issues getting to CA from the East Coast due to snow, and Elizabeth was very friendly, prompt, and super helpful when communicating back and forth about my arrival. I will definitely come back next time I am in the Monterey area!"

Just 1.5 mile walk to the aquarium (or a very short drive).  The kitchens was one of the best stocked ones we've every seen at a rental: all of the equipment you could ever need as well as all the spices and condiments, too!

Fabulous claw foot tub, and great shower.  Kitchen updated but still has all of the cute cabinets and old world features. Enclosed yard, front and back; perfect for our dogs.

Elizabeth even set out fresh flowers for our arrival.  There were more than enough towels, espresso, modern appliances,  and two queen beds.  We actually had a fifth person on the couch and never felt cramped. I've never had an airbnb host provide so many amenities as Elizabeth did for us.   Great stay on the peninsula!"

Tout ce dont vous avez besoin est déjà sur place (lait  fruits beurre snacks etc..)
Nous avons adoré cette pause au nord du pacifique"
9574239,173062814,2017-07-22,43951152,Sue,"Fantastic period cottage in the lovely pacific grove area of Monterey, this is by far the best airbnb we have ever stayed In. The house was beautiful, and fully equipped with all we could  ever need. Elizabeth even left us food, milk and fruit. We met Elizabeth who was lovely and gave us recommendations of
where to eat. I can't recommend this enough. The whale watching and kayaking from moss landing were amazing, whale just outside harbor mouth and loads of sea otters, seals and bird life when kayaking. Better to go from moss landing than Monterey. All in all a fabulous trip and great airbnb. 
"
9574239,174934026,2017-07-27,5937351,Glenn,"Very nice place in a very relaxed town.  Convenient to beaches, shops, Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Nice quiet neighborhood.  Great place to stay."
9574239,175773108,2017-07-29,112740509,Stuart,"We spent a couple of nights in July 2017 and had a good stay and everything as described on the listing. Packed full of everything and more that you'd need for a few days here. Easy walking distance to the lovely shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove and the coast.
Elizabeth also kindly lent us tickets for the aquarium which was fantastic.
One thing to note which isn't something you'd initially consider, there are no curtains in the living room, so at night if you aren't used to this it can feel a bit uncomfortable with the street being able to see in. We just ended up going to bed early!
All in all an enjoyable stay and would recommend."
9574239,177449440,2017-08-03,29763882,Cheng,"Eliz's house has the perfect location for us, just several minutes drive to 17 Mile Dr and Monterey Bay Aquarium. We arrived at the house very late that day, and Eliz prepared everything for us and the house was immersed in bright light and in soft jazz, comfortable indeed. Guests won't have worries about being hungry because the fridge and closet are full of varieties of food. The house is big enough for family with large kitchen and living room. The house is aged but definitely clean and stylish. Eliz is very warm hearted and always ready to help. "

Gave us help about local restaurants and places to go. Pacific Grove is a lovely place and I would highly recommend it.
9574239,190281642,2017-09-03,52650592,Nicole,Nice cottage in a good location.  Quiet neighborhood and cute park.  We appreciate that Elizabeth brought us breakfast supplies and went over how to operate the TV.
9574239,190998688,2017-09-05,73421972,Andrey,"Great rustic house, yet many important appliances (kitchen, laundry) are brand new. The kitchen is beyond well stocked - there is literally everything!
Very nice location on a quiet street. One block to a park, 5 min walk to downtown. 20 min walk to Asilomar beach.
We'll be back!"

9574239,197439478,2017-09-25,68223655,Peg,My husband and thoroughly enjoyed our time in Elizabeth 'so home. Her list of restaurants was right on...especially Fandango-what an experience.  The ocean is just a  quick drive with very doable walking. My only wish is that some day we could return.
9574239,201720174,2017-10-08,68993571,Jenny,Lovely little cottage in a quite area. Thanks for all the supplies. We had a great weekend.

House was very clean and the bathroom was spotless. Beds were comfortable. and shower was nice. Elizabeth was very helpful and friendly and provided plenty of brochures on things to see and do. Kitchen was fully stocks for making meals and Elizabeth even provided groceries for breakfast. I highly recommend when your in the area.
9574239,202984872,2017-10-13,15100090,Joanie,"This space is GREAT!  We had kids along for the ride and it was the perfect little house for a family vacation.  It has everything you need (and more) for a very comfortable home away from home.  Elizabeth is great, very accommodating and very helpful.  She provided a great breakfast and lots of snacks. :). We highly recommend this place and host!"
9574239,203647632,2017-10-15,5524407,Matthew,"This spot is fantastic! A lovely home in a great neighborhood, on a quiet street but with but easy access to the main road. So many beautiful touches & high quality furnishings - a space for those who appreciate a beautiful environment.  

The beddings were all top rate - super comfortable, very clean & good quality. Towels were NOT thread bare (so many airbnb's are!)  

Great kitchen w Nespresso maker coffees and nicely stocked fridge (milk, juice, eggs, granola bars, etc). 

Nice living room / dining room spaces, large tv w feature channels (On Demand!). 

Very easy check in/out, host very helpful and proactively communicative. 
Two thumbs up!!"

Also the stacked kitchen inkl. nespresso machine were great and made our stay worth while and memorable. Would always stay here again. Thanks Elizabeth"
9574239,206981003,2017-10-27,149966060,Liz,"We thoroughly enjoyed Elizabeth's adorable cottage. It is light, airy, close to all there is to see and do in the area, and yet private and quiet as well. It is fabulously well-stocked (we chose to cook in both nights of our stay and had everything we needed at our fingertips from pots and pans to spices, olive oil, vinegars, snacks, fruit, etc.) and very comfortable.

The only thing that could possibly be an issue for someone a little older and/or someone not so spry is the shower situation as it is a part of an older, deep claw foot tub. As a shorter person, it was a giant step in and out for me...and for anyone with any sort of mobility issues, it could make bathing a little difficult. That wouldn't keep me from rebooking however! As a first time renter, this was an amazing find!"
9574239,208934278,2017-11-03,392485,Patty,Elizabeth’s place has everything you could possibly ever want or need. It was quiet and very homey! We would love to stay there every time we go to Pacific Grove. She was always available for any questions we had. A totally wonderful experience!

9574239,215285754,2017-11-28,19046257,Sheron,"Awesome location, place and host. We walked from Elizabeth’s place to Cannery Row up to the Monterey US coast guard jetty (loads of seals sunning themselves). So glad we stayed in Pacific Grove cute town, lovely people and amazed at the deer grazing on the municipal golf course. Will definitely stay again next time I head north. House was very roomy and comfortable for 3 adults"
9574239,216437974,2017-12-03,55167335,Lindsey,"Elizabeth's cottage is absolutely perfect! We had a wonderful weekend stay. The bedrooms were perfect for two couples, there was a cute living room/seating area, and a nice sized, well-stocked kitchen - Elizabeth left fruit, coffee, some refrigerated/pantry items, really anything we might've needed. She also left us with a list of restaurant recommendations, which was greatly appreciated, and was super quick to respond if we had any questions. The location was perfect, too - a nice, short walk into town, short drive to the aquarium, and a quick drive into Monterey or Carmel. Couldn't have asked for a better spot for our weekend getaway! Would definitely stay here again next time we're in the area!"
9574239,218270910,2017-12-11,16728888,Mark,We had a great time staying at Elizabeth's place. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful - sitting at the front yard watching the stars at night was magical. The house is cozy and clean and check in/check out was a breeze. Will be back!

9574239,224262762,2018-01-02,54780855,Cyrenee,"My boyfriend and I decided to spend the New Year in Carmel. With limited availability, we luckily scored this little gem! Location was central to Monterey and Carmel. We felt right at home, comfy and cozy. Elizabeth’s cottage is a must stay! The house was furnished adorably. Side note- the open windows provide the best lighting (probably my favorite!!). I would make a trip back just to stay here. Elizabeth is a great host and is easily accessible. Thanks for making our stay amazing!"
9574239,224910833,2018-01-04,1837572,Bart,"Elizabeth's beautifully maintained vintage house is a marvelous place to stay in Pacific Grove. The house is perfect for two couples, as we were, or a small family, and is meticulously maintained a rental as I've found. Elizabeth was prompt with communications, friendly and helpful when we met her. What's not to like about this gem in one of the most beautiful corners of the world?"
9574239,225522917,2018-01-06,96589488,Manuel,Everything was as promised.  Pictures were accurate and the house was so cute.  This is a solid choice for the Pacific Grove / Monterey area.  The host was easy to reach and very friendly.  We will be back!

Elizabeth has provided an appealing, bright, tasteful cottage with a well provisioned kitchen, and ample, comfortable space. She was consistently  welcoming and cheerfully responded to any questions."
9574239,228225197,2018-01-18,144086170,Jon,There is a lack of privacy at night since there are no curtains or blinds in the main room.

Lovely historic cottage with all the modern amenities with historic charm.  Kitchen fully stocked even an espresso machine.  Quiet, yet within a few blocks of main downtown.  Planning another trip in spring and another stay at Elizabeth’s cottage.   Any special requests for early check in or late check out ask as Elizabeth extremely flexible and generous."
9574239,232693193,2018-02-05,5117533,Dan,"Elizabeth's place is the perfect, quaint lodging to have as a home base to explore Pacific Grove and the surrounding coastline. You're an equal distance walk from the water and the adorable downtown area with all the amenities you'd want. You also have quick access to get out of town and down the coast without having to drive through Monterey. I'd stay again and again. The snacks she made available to take on the road down to Big Sur were a huge bonus.  :)"
9574239,234453751,2018-02-12,10276942,Phil,Ammenities are amazing.  We really enjoyed the old house feeling.  Beds and couch are comfy.  Location is great and the neighborhood is super quiet.
9574239,235193022,2018-02-15,9927817,Gloria,"Nice home in historical street. Two big bedrooms and a good bathroom size. The kitchen had everything needed to cook. Enjoyed having lots of clean white towels. There is also a washer and dryer. Good location to visit Carmel.
Problems:  lots of ants in the kitchen the day after (we were not adviced)  and there is a construction right behind one of the bedrooms, making noise from 8 AM. Elizabeth was great meeting you and your dogs."

My friend loved the Nespresso coffee maker.  We ended up using the washer and dryer which are very nice and there is a dishwasher. 
The neighborhood is pretty and quiet; the house is walking distance to the beach and restaurants. Parking was easy. I would recommend Elizabeth's place to anyone, it was comfortable and perfect for our trip to Monterey!"
9574239,246099142,2018-03-24,127281893,Phyllis,Perfect quiet place to stay.  All of the creature comforts were provided.  The bedding was comfortable and luxurious.

It was just the right size for the 4 of us with absolutely everything you need or want from the restful beds (with very nice linens), spacious & well equipped kitchen, relaxing front room area & trendy bath with towels galore! Even the neighbors were sweet & friendly.  But most of all, it was all the personal touches our host, Elizabeth shared with us that made our stay outstanding! She answered all our questions very prompt, gave great advice on things to see & do plus dining recommendations and made sure we had things for breakfast. Plus we accidentally left a small box of phone accessories and she shipped them back the next day! A truly wonderful experience all the way around!"
9574239,248563837,2018-03-31,73852179,Carol,"My husband, adult son and myself stayed at Elizabeth's house for two nights as part of a little road trip we took when visiting our son at UC Berkeley. Elizabeth's house is charming and beautifully decorated.  Each of the two bedrooms has a very comfortable Queen size bed and the kitchen is amazingly well appointed with appliances, utensils, spices and many extras. We particularly enjoyed the espresso machine, the breakfast foods (eggs, oatmeal) and the snacks she left for us in the cupboard.  The living room is very comfortable for socializing and/or watching the large screen t.v.  The front yard was a nice place to sit and read or just soak up the sunshine.  The neighborhood  is  beautiful and quiet, and it is close to the main street in Pacific Grove where there are several excellent restaurants as well as some shops and boutiques.  Elizabeth left four membership passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which saved the three of us over $100 in entrance fees.  We loved this place and couldn't have asked for more!"
9574239,249773107,2018-04-02,12038051,Emily,We had a great stay! It is a small and cozy cottage and was perfect for our family of 4! Our kids are 7 & 13 and we all fit great! It was close to everything and in a very safe and friendly neighborhood!
10107211,62520883,2016-02-15,7942447,Steve,"I almost didn't want to write a review, so my family and I could keep this little ""gem"" all to ourselves! But, out of respect for Joan and her beautiful property, I must share my experience. First off, the property itself is so beautiful and charming - both inside and out. The interior is clearly remodeled, almost like a new house. There was more than enough room for my family of three. I always appreciate thoughtful touches, which included the quality soaps/shampoos, linens, dishware, etc, provided by Joan.

The location is fantastic. You're less than a 10 minute walk from a beautiful beach, and all of our activities were less than a 10 minute drive away. Another bonus is the aquarium member passes included with the rental. We were able to skip the long line for tickets and save ourselves the admission fee. Don't forget to factor that in when pricing out other options if planning to visit the aquarium.

Lastly, in the email communications with Joan, she was very kind and quick to respond. I always feel more relaxed when staying at a new property if I believe the owner to be a good person. There were no surprises upon our arrival and check in/out was very smooth.

So...great house, great location, great host - perfect! We will definitely be visiting again! "
10107211,64682489,2016-03-06,32548353,Sheila,"My husband and I spent 3 nights and had a lovely time. Joan has gone above and beyond supplying all of the things you may need to cook your meals, watch tv, play games and more. I loved all of the little touches, like candles in the bedroom, that made this place feel like home. Everything is in very good condition, clean, and well organized. Joan sent us a list of things we might want to do while we were in town and she even found us a place to rent the bikes that I had asked her about!"
10107211,64824408,2016-03-08,33590736,Romana,"Words cannot express how lovely this little house is, it truly lives up to its name Little Gem !The  hostess Joan , was responsive and warm . The decor was fresh and tasteful . The host put a lot of effort into making everything straightforward with instructions and labels on cupboards etc which was very helpful .

My friend who knows the area well ,and was very pleased with the location . .The restaurant The Fish Wives is walking distance and very taste food . 
The free passes to the aquarium were a welcome bonus . I saw staggering displays there and will keep memories of this trip with me for a lifetime . 
Thank you to Joan for a wonderful experience !

10107211,65566094,2016-03-15,7771772,Charmaine,"We had a lovely stay at Little Gem. It really is a comfortable, cute and stylish gem of a place. Everything we needed was there for preparing our own meals and escaping the conference we were attending at the Asilomar (!). Just a short 15 minute walk to Asilomar resort and 20 minutes to the beach, or to the shops, it is a great location in Pacific Grove. Joan was easy to communicate, very responsive and helpful and keen for us to have a good stay. Thanks very much for looking after us Joan. :) "
10107211,66948257,2016-03-25,7700771,April,Our week at your property was exactly what we needed. The space is so neat and lovely and had everything and more we could think of to use. Wonderful!

She provides a stylish, well-appointed spot that is walking distance to many local favorites: beaches, parks and restaurants. We slept well in this quiet little corner of PG.  Thank you Joan for a wonderful alternative to a motel on the peninsula...almost like being at home! "
10107211,70250509,2016-04-17,9814342,Meg,Joan's place was in a perfect location: clean and well equipped for a weekend stay- we wish we could have stayed for a week!

10107211,71646291,2016-04-27,68105164,Eric,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Little Gem of Asilomar.  Joan’s home was spotless, comfortable, cheery and well-decorated, and equipped with all the various amenities and conveniences you could want or need during your stay.  We greatly appreciated the use of the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes, as well as the maps and local info and tips she compiled in her “Welcome” binder.  Joan was very responsive to any messages, and it truly couldn’t have been an easier or more pleasant experience!  We look forward to another stay at her home in the near future!"
10107211,71912996,2016-04-29,3280683,Keith,"Would highly recommend Joan's house for anyone looking to stay in this or the surrounding area. Clean, spacious, great location, lovely yard. Joan was great with communication and also left a list of tips for the best places to eat local, free passes for the aquarium and excellent directions for getting there. Will certainly be my first port of call the next time I go as well as recommending it to friends. 5 star! "
10107211,75561730,2016-05-22,68629685,Rachel,What a lovely place to stay - such a gorgeous little home I'm a friendly neighbourhood. It felt like a home from home as soon as we walked in.
10107211,76464659,2016-05-27,6987641,Donna,"What can I say but the Little Gem was all it said it was plus more. Joan was easy to communicate with, answered any of my questions quickly. 
The Little Gem was clean and very well organized, you can see a lot of thought was put into making this feel cozy and welcoming, their was nothing that we needed. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of closet space. The kitchen has all the needs to make a meal, we used the BBQ which was a nice plus. The neighborhood was quiet and safe, we walked to the Fishwife restaurant for dinner one night, I do recommend it, walked to the Asilomar, and to the beach for a wonderful stroll. We also went to Big Sur for the day and hiked a awesome trail that took us through the redwoods to magnificent views of the ocean.
A extra plus to our visit was the passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, it's been years since I've been there, so interesting and beautiful.
We will be back, hopefully soon to the Little Gem, thank again Joan "
10107211,77361164,2016-05-31,32271232,Greg,House was great and exactly as advertised.  It perfectly fit our needs.
10107211,78172718,2016-06-05,44458635,Ronna,"The best Airbnb experience!

My boyfriend and I couldn't have been happier with our stay at Joan's. A few days before the trip, Joan made sure I had all of the information needed for the perfect vacation. I love feeling as prepared as possible and Joan provided directions, a list of what we didn't need to pack, and a long list of the best nearby restaurants to try, (which was fantastic)! She went above and beyond for us and is by far the best Airbnb host I've had the pleasure of interacting with!

The drive down was beautiful and after a fun-filled day at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, we arrived at the Little Gem. The house was very open and modern. The kitchen is huge and the bedroom is great! The large bed is extremely comfortable and the room also has a hidden pull-down bunk bed if you need it. So cool!

After getting to the Little Gem, we stopped at Fishwife, one of the local restaurants that Joan suggested. It was right down the road, the service was great, and their calamari was out of this world! I'd also suggest Crema for breakfast, which is also a short drive away from the Little Gem.

If you plan on visiting the aquarium during your stay, make sure to follow Joan's instructions and go before 11AM to see the live feeding! It was an incredible experience and was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. We'll definitely return to the Little Gem in the future. Thank you Joan! (:"
10107211,78905177,2016-06-10,28248753,Lindsey,"Felt like home!  Nice and clean.  Modern and updated.  Comfortable bed.   Joan communicated all the information we needed beforehand and responded quickly when I asked a question during our stay.  It was just a short drive to the 17 mile drive, aquarium, cannery row and places we ate.  Aquarium guest passes were an added bonus.  We would definitely stay again!"

10107211,84750415,2016-07-09,19407021,Cary,Cute place! Inside was stylish and roomy! Great for weekend getaway! Joan was easy to get hold of and a half onset full host.

10107211,86970150,2016-07-18,77819549,Rachelle,"My entire experience with Joan and her property was amazing, from an initial speedy reply to confirm the booking to the beautiful (and thoroughly equipped!) home. There were plenty of amenities, more than expected, and the house was incredibly clean, comfortable, and cute! The extensive list of recommendations showed a knowledge of and love for the local area, which felt very special. I appreciated how well everything in the home was labelled. The kitchen is very user-friendly— great gas range, large sink, and infinite bonus points for having actually sharp knives to work with! A foodie's dream in a rental house. I'd give 5 stars just for that. ;)

Overall, this is a great place to stay while enjoying the Monterey/Pacific Grove area. Between the simple luxury and comfort of the home and the long list of suggested activities, we only wished we could've been there longer to enjoy more of it!"

It's the perfect base to explore surrounding areas like Carmel and even venture south to Big Sur. I particularly love the backyard deck. I'll book again the next time I'm in the area. 
10107211,93986436,2016-08-14,18843587,Rachel,"Joan's Little Gem was the perfect destination for my solo weekend getaway. It's just as described and Joan is a great host by providing so many local recommendations. The passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium are a major plus!

I would love to return and would certainly recommend the Little Gem."
10107211,99172883,2016-09-03,2300348,Tiffany,"This is a fabulous Airbnb. The house is beautiful, clean, and organized. There are great amenities (w/d, tea/coffee, tv, soft bedding/towels, aquarium passes) - Not to mention the bed has a very comfortable mattress perfect for a good night's sleep. We also liked the neighborhood and proximity to great restaurants/beach/aquarium. Joan's recommendations were great.  Very impressed and hope to visit again!"
10107211,101013494,2016-09-11,46974629,Garth,Joan had one of the most beautiful AirBnBs!! First and foremost she provided two membership passes to the residences staying there. The downtown area was a 15/20 casual walk away. The check in/check out policy was very flexible and Joan returned my emails in minutes and provided information on restaurants/attractions in the area. Book now!!
10107211,102692208,2016-09-18,90703691,Kristin,"The place was beautiful, cozy, and clean. The location was great and easy to walk to Pacific Grove and Monterey.  There's so much to see in the area, we loved our stay! "

10107211,108135096,2016-10-14,56943010,Sarah,"Amazing holiday house in Pacific Grove!

We are travelling around the US and this is the best place we have stayed so far.

Joan was very quick to respond when we contacted her despite us booking at relatively late notice. 

The house was impeccable on arrival and completely decked out with everything you could possibly want in a holiday house, especially as we are travelling with a 7month old baby.

Although not on the beach, the house is within easy walking distance of Monterey and the centre of Pacific Grove. Also really close to the beautiful Asilomar Beach and the entrance to the 17mile drive!

Another bonus is the member pass to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We may not have visited had it not been for Joan's passed and we would have missed out on a great experience.

We absolutely loved staying at Joan's house and would not hesitate in recommending it for your stay in the area. If we are lucky enough to visit the area again we will definitely look to stay at Joan's again!"
10107211,109460735,2016-10-21,48286152,Rebecca,Great place to relax!
10107211,109931005,2016-10-23,3805507,Kim & Ian,"Joan's place made for the perfect getaway weekend. The home is well-updated, and we made good use of the kitchen during our stay. The backyard is huge and has a nice deck and picnic table. We were also able to go on nice runs from Little Gem along the ocean and around Pacific Grove -- a nice location for this!

Would definitely stay again."

10107211,112183078,2016-11-04,6200055,Diego,"Joan is an awesome host! This place is perfect for a quiet stay. We went to the Monterey Bay Acquarium, biked around the 17 mile Dr. and jogged by the beach. It was perfect!"
10107211,112589769,2016-11-06,753500,Andrea,We really enjoyed staying at Joan's place. Very clean and quiet. Nicely decorated with a big kitchen for cooking. This was a really relaxing place to stay for a weekend. Thanks!
10107211,113271241,2016-11-11,27243470,Tom,Stayed for 5 days at joan's place during November.  It was good spot with comfortable and clean accommodations. Recommended for couples exploring the Monterey peninsula.
10107211,114877895,2016-11-20,17659014,Shelby,"'Little Gem' was a great place to stay on our Monterey excursion.  It was clean and comfortable with everything we needed.  It is exactly as described and photographed.  Joan was very responsive to any questions and requests we had.  The welcome book had helpful information, such as maps, restaurants, and even how to work the pilot light for the heater.  The MBA passes are a special bonus! We were really pleased with our stay. "

Also close to everything we wanted to visit - the aquarium, coast, restaurants, etc.  Couldn't have imagined a better place for a few days of rest & relaxation.  We've stayed at over a dozen Airbnbs throughout the years and this is easily one of the best! "
10107211,117083760,2016-12-04,80266394,Stuart,Joan's place is amazing.  Neat as a pin and so well appointed that we wanted for nothing.  We would definitely stay there again and are recommending it to friends.

Her apartment was super clean, bright and had everything you can ask for. The kitchen was superbly equipped and the bathroom new and with a spacious shower. We had a perfect time in Pacific Grove and would definitely recommend this apt to everyone."

10107211,125431475,2017-01-05,11803366,Rosalba,"What a great little place to stay if you are visiting Monterey Bay. My husband and I couldn't have booked a better place. Joan's Little Gem was absolutely perfect. It was so clean and well-equipped, especially the kitchen! Everything we needed was there for us to use. Checking in was a breeze and parking was easy. We loved the neighborhood as it was very quiet and really pretty. The two passes to the aquarium were AWESOME as it saved us money and a long line! All the sightseeing locations are a very short distance away from the house. Joan even includes a binder with all kinds of useful information from sightseeing locations to restaurants. So organized. We had to get in contact with Joan during our stay due to small occurrences, such as a leaky toilet, and she was quick and efficient to respond. If we ever come back to Monterey Bay, we will definitely be coming back to Joan's Little Gem. Thanks Joan! "
10107211,126024765,2017-01-08,47496765,Alexandria,The place was spotless and neat. Had such a comfortable stay. She has everything you need and the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes were a huge plus! Perfect for a weekend getaway and close to Cannery Row and Fisherman's Wharf.

10107211,129430661,2017-01-30,40598051,Sara,Joan's house was the perfect place for our weekend trip to Pacific Grove. The house was clean and very spacious for two people. It was walking distance to Spanish Bay Golf links and a quick drive to town. Joan's recommendations were super helpful and exactly what we were looking for. And the Aquarium passes were a great added bonus. Would definitely stay here again!!

10107211,133788258,2017-02-24,33041773,Jenny,Joan was extremely helpful. Her place was perfect for our trip to Monterey. The place felt like home. 
10107211,134300344,2017-02-26,15496240,Charles,"The place was really beautiful, clean, and great! The only downside was it gets pretty cold and doesn't warm up very fast with the furnace."

The owner thought of every possible amenity, new appliances, lots of kitchen utensils, bathroom is modern, bed very comfortable. The home is light & cheerful.  It's wonderful to be so close to Asilomar & the beach.  You will want to visit again & again.  Jeanne"
10107211,140240593,2017-03-28,6178326,Daniel,"Joan's place is a true gem. It was an extremely comfortable home base for our stay in the Monterey Bay area. For those who like to, it is walkable to downtown Pacific Grove and even the Monterey Bay Aquarium if you're feeling a bit adventurous. Everything else in the area is a short drive away. We had an amazing time and would definitely come back."
10107211,141585545,2017-04-03,63834187,Linda,"The house is so delightful-interior design very appealing.  I wanted to take it home with us!  Would be cozy with more than 2, and a king bed would be the crowning touch.  Quiet neighborhood, just a wonderful get-away spot."
10107211,142106879,2017-04-06,4414095,Ken,"Very cute place,  comfortable with very well stocked kitchen in a cute and quiet neighborhood just a short walk from the beach.   We stayed for three days and used it as a base to explore the beaches and state parks.   Will definitely return"
10107211,143601204,2017-04-12,161089,Martha,"We had a wonderful little getaway!  Finally can ""check off"" my bucket list item of riding my bike through the 17-Mile Drive!  Super close to the gate (PG entrance) and to Lover's Point.  We loved the location and the peaceful & quaint neighborhood.  We sure hope to go back! :-)"
10107211,144900492,2017-04-16,97575721,Michael,"Our stay at Joan's place was great! Everything that you could possibly need while being away from home was readily available, including a binder with tons of information about the house and the area. The house was very warm and inviting. It got a bit cold at night but the blankets in the bed helped a lot. I would definitely recommend Joan's house and would love to stay again if she would have us. "
10107211,147252183,2017-04-25,12149824,Elisabeth,"A lovely place to stay, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Felt like home for our weekend stay with everything you needed. It was around a half hour walk to the acquarium and we really appreciated the  free passes. Thanks for a great stay! "
10107211,148019983,2017-04-29,60766041,Stephen,"Little Gem is a gorgeous place and makes you feel relaxed as soon as you enter.  It's well equipped and very clean and comfortable.  We had been travelling for some time staying in hotels, so it was great to be able to cook some meals and relax properly.  There are great runs and walks nearby.
We didn't want to leave this beautiful place and would love to return one day. "

10107211,151635791,2017-05-13,5419548,Katharine,"We had a lovely stay, the place was very clean, comfy & stylish. Great local info in the folder & the aquarium passes were a brilliant touch. We walked to the aquarium (and back) and it would have been much ether to drive & take advantage of the free parking close by!"
10107211,152686025,2017-05-17,7805476,Jan,Very stylish interior and great equipment. Aquarium tickets are great for a bad weather day!
10107211,153313447,2017-05-20,23308836,Edwin,"The home was easy to find and located in a very quiet neighborhood about a mile from the aquarium. It was very clean and well furnished with everything you would need, including toiletries, Netflix, board games, etc. It was pretty chilly at night while we were visiting, but the silent space heater in the bedroom was great at keeping us cozy. Only recommendation would be to add a full curtain to the bathroom and kitchen windows, as the current setup only has decorative curtains rather than functional ones. Thanks for the enjoyable stay!"
10107211,154649516,2017-05-25,22068131,Lindsay,"Joan was great at communicating and helpful for our stay. Wonderful home just the right size for a family three. Beautifully decorated, comfortable had all the amenities to cook meals from. Great backyard and deck. Helpful home binder for restaurants and parking for MBA. Having the passes for MBA was so great, since we were traveling with a little one it helped we could make short trips and then come back for nap time. "

10107211,160361929,2017-06-13,59633817,Lauren,"Joan's place was comfortable and private. We enjoyed the backyard, listening to the birds and even saw two deer. It met our expectations and was an easy and quick drive to the aquarium (highly recommended!) Only downfall was arriving and the place not being cleaned from the last guests. Joan responded immediately to this issue, as well as returned our cleaning fee. We would highly recommend Joan's place."
10107211,162650885,2017-06-21,13358577,Erich,Great location and great coziness combined for a ultra relaxed trip in a beautiful setting. Hosts were great with communication and the tickets to the aquarium were a lovely added bonus ;)

10107211,168644622,2017-07-09,135567290,James,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights in July. The house is located on a nice quiet street and had a very friendly neighbor. It was very accessible to the main attractions in Monterrey. We got amazing restaurant recommendations from the detailed binder that was provided. The aquarium passes allowed us to skip the long entrance lines. The house had everything--blankets to snuggle on the couch, extra pillows for the bed, tons of towels, a huge shower. My girlfriend found the house to be adorable and was so grateful to have a peaceful place to come back to. All around great experience and would highly recommend."

We appreciated Joan's attention to detail both in the home, and in responding to our emails. We love all that the area has to offer and enjoyed returning to her cozy home each night."
10107211,180594223,2017-08-10,39839814,Vickie,"We just returned from 3 nights at Joan’s “Little Gem.” We found the home very clean, cozy and comfortable.

We would definitely recommend Joan’s home and we hope to return ourselves as well."

10107211,194367726,2017-09-16,65481259,Daniela,"This is an awesome spot and absolutely exceeded our expectations. Calm, clean, modern, great location, close to 17 mile and the beach, free entrance to the aquarium, convenient bed and a lot of room and also many things that are already in the appartment you would not expect. Fantastic. Would recommend it to everyone and we would also come back without hesitation. Thansk a lot Joan for making our stay such a pleasure."
10107211,195303210,2017-09-18,15120105,Tony,"This is a comfortable, well located house for a couple. It is very well appointed, newly renovated and clean. It is a great base for exploring the locality. Very close to the start of the famous 17 Mile Drive. There were free passes to the Monterey Aquarium to use which was a real bonus. Quiet residential neighbourhood. Very good washer and dryer."

Everything you need is here, thanks for having a great time!!"
10107211,201621357,2017-10-08,92898915,Angeles,"The location is great! Place was very clean and stylish and had everything we could have asked for.

10107211,208516460,2017-11-01,14747292,Fabrice,"Maison pour un couple. Très confortable (bonne literie, linge de maison beau, très bien équipée, tv écran plat avec plein de chaînes...) on s’y trouve très bien. Il n’y a pas de vue mais un petit patio (nous n’en avons pas profité car le matin il faisait frais mais nous imaginons facilemente qu’il doit être très agréable en été). La maison est impeccable!"
10107211,210673863,2017-11-10,56291133,Tom,"Little Gem was that and more.  It was warm and welcoming, clean, comfortable, thoughtfully organized, and just really charming.  Joan anticipated our needs in so many ways.  We would definitely love to book it again.  It felt like home!"
10107211,211362377,2017-11-12,152103060,Ben,"A great home in a quiet neighborhood. The MBA passes are great and allow you to skip the long line to buy tickets. The area is fantastic and there was tons to do. The 17 Mile drive is right around the corner from here and downtown Monterey is really close. An Uber trip to Downtown ran about $10. The neighbor's cat, Muffin, was super friendly and made us feel welcome."
10107211,212037144,2017-11-15,42804444,Amr,"Joan was very responsive to my messages.

10107211,213072767,2017-11-19,16349714,Simi,"Joan's place really was a little gem. We enjoyed a low key weekend and fell in love with Pacific Grove. The house was pictured as it was and we walked to the beach, while starbucks, safeway, and trader joes were also right around the corner."
10107211,214102644,2017-11-24,463905,Paul,"This is our second time staying at Joan's place - and we loved it just as much as the first time around!  Highly recommend it.  Super clean, well-equipped, and aquarium passes are a wonderful bonus.  Will hopefully be back again soon!"
10107211,219492373,2017-12-17,150003827,Dane,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Joan's place for a birthday weekend getaway. Her place is adorable! It's extremely clean, spacious, and has everything you could possibly need: living room with TV (Roku included), backyard, huge kitchen with cooking tools, nice bathroom and bedroom, etc. You could tell that Joan put a lot of effort into making sure her place felt right at home for her guests. 

In regards to the area, it's very quiet and charming. At night, you can't really hear anything! Her house is about a 20 minute walk from Asilomar beach which is gorgeous and about a 5 minute drive from downtown Pacific Grove, which has a ton of cute shops and restaurants. 

All in all, this has been an amazing experience and I would certainly stay at Joan's place again!"
10107211,225233755,2018-01-05,23590439,Clare,"Joan was super response, both before and during our stay.  The house was VERY clean and comfortable.  Joan has beautiful artwork and touches throughout her home, and these made for an even more enjoyable stay.  The guest passes to the Aquarium was an extra bonus (note: 2 adult passes translate to about $100, if you're planning a visit during your stay). The location was great, since we were traveling between Monterey, Carmel, and the many amazing resort golf courses.
Thank you Joan for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
10107211,226272483,2018-01-09,90144455,Kate,"What a fantastic find, good value, and safe place for my little family ( myself, my husband, and toddler). We found the home easily, checked in, and found the home very stylish and comfortable with everything we needed for our three day stay. Very close to the aquarium, only about a 5 minute drive, and free passes for 2 adults too. We hope to come back and would highly recommend this house! Thanks Joan!"

10107211,230668533,2018-01-28,27370274,Daniel,"We LOVED staying here! We were planning a weekend in Monterey for the purpose of bringing our 15 month old daughter to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and we are so glad we chose this particular AirBnb. What drew us in initially was that two Aquarium adult guest passes were included in the cost and this place is so close to the Aquarium. This unit was very clean and doesn't share any walls with anyone else (so nice and quiet), and there is even a little backyard with a picnic table. This place has EVERYTHING - washer, dryer, dishwasher, French coffee press, pretty much any cooking utensil you would need, microwave, toaster, tupperware, shampoo, conditioner, extra blankets, Netflix and HBO available on the TV, all the toilet paper and soft, fluffy towels you could possibly need, and so much more. The bed was comfortable, and the bedroom was spacious enough for us to fit our daughter's Pack N Play inside. I appreciated the large curtains over the windows to block out the sunlight as needed and that the neighborhood was quiet and appeared to be very safe. We would definitely return here for any future trips to Monterey."
10107211,232399543,2018-02-04,153776164,Valorie,Amazing! This perfect vacation spot feels like a bright and airy beach cottage. The colors/designs are soothing and perfect for a quiet getaway. We loved the usability of the kitchen and availability of cooking utensils. The MBA passes and games were nice additions too! We enjoyed the beautiful walk to the Aquarium in the morning and all the eateries nearby. 10/10 would stay here again!
10107211,233244745,2018-02-08,95162789,Sarah,"We loved our stay here!!  Little Gem was bright, clean, and comfortable - just as pictured.  We loved the location and being able to walk to the beach and Lighthouse Avenue, and the MBA passes are an awesome extra benefit.  Highly recommended."
10107211,235190197,2018-02-15,73374289,Rachael,"Joan’s place is beautiful, and she replies very promptly if you text or call her!"
10107211,237149757,2018-02-21,75223905,Liliana Maria,"This home away from home is clean, comfortable and stylish. Within a 10 min drive to Monterey, the home is central to everything in the area including Carmel and the beaches. The kitchen is gorgeous and comes with everything that you need, the bed is so comfortable that you won’t want to get out of it, and the backyard is the perfect place to enjoy your meals."
10107211,241307491,2018-03-08,130067104,Steve,This is a nice snug place for 2 people.  The bed was very comfortable.  It had all the amenities we needed and it was nice to have laundry facilities in the space with our extended stay.  It was quiet and in a good location.
10107211,243151004,2018-03-14,62781430,Amy,"We absolutely loved our stay at Little Gem. It was beautiful, stylish, quiet and incredibly comfortable. The backyard is stunning and the location can’t be beat - a quick drive or walk to all the incredible things the area has to offer. We look forward to staying here again!"
10107211,246984857,2018-03-26,9028877,Phoebe,"Little Gem was just that- a stylish and comfortable home away from home. The property was walking distance from the stunning Asilomar beach, and just blocks away from 17 mike drive. In addition, Joan was a delightful, communicative, and superbly helpful host from start to finish. Highly recommended!"
10107211,250963834,2018-04-06,866780,Paul,"Lovely home, beautifully appointed - such a great stay! I’m hoping Joan’s place is open the next time I want to visit the area. Everything was immaculate; the kitchen was VERY well equipped and it is clear that Joan put time, thought and effort into making the home and area friendly for guests. A truly top - drawer stay."
10107211,251867394,2018-04-08,8629546,Colin,"We loved our stay here! Great, clean, relaxing place in a wonderful neighborhood."
10107211,252474505,2018-04-10,173842603,Mei,"This place is wonderful with an awesome bunk bed set up in the large bedroom. We didn't use the bunk beds as our son is a baby, but I do see it becoming useful when he is older. This is a charming quiet neighborhood and was close to things we wanted to do."
10107211,253535125,2018-04-14,22244772,Emily,We had a lovely stay in Joan’s place. It is a great location and the garden out the back is a lovely space to relax.
10107211,255207473,2018-04-19,179773632,Amélie,J’ai adoré mon séjour. L’emplacement est parfait (à 10 minutes à pied de la plage d’Asilomar et très bien situé pour explorer la région de la péninsule de Monterey). Le logement était propre et très bien équipé! Je le recommande fortement.
10204512,57857501,2015-12-29,20904803,Wolfgang,"We found a clean and comfortable room in a great location with breathtaking views of the beach and the braking waves on the cliff right outside the house.
 
The place is in 20 min walking distance to the fascinating Monterey Acquarium - just follow the coast. It is also close to the interesting Point Lobos part where we enjoyed a hike and saw dozens of dolphins and hundreds of pelicans hunting 100 meters away in the bay.

The breakfast in the breakfast room was great and we had nice conversations with other guests over (free) wine in the evening at the house. The staff was very helpful and well organized. "
10204512,113020056,2016-11-09,28884795,Lacy,"This place was perfect! Perfect location with lovely views (we were able to see whales and the sunrise from our window). The service was very hospitable, the bed very comfy."
11210583,96091515,2016-08-21,89247833,Erik,"The hosts met me at the property at the time we agreed upon for check in and they were very friendly and accommodating, showing me all that their home had to offer. The place was immaculate and exactly as they had described in the listing - it is cozy, but offered plenty of room for five guests with two bedrooms and a comfortable couch. Built in the early 1900's it has preserved the charm of its age and is very well kept inside and out. The large windows keep it bright inside and has a real homey-feel to it with the way it has been decorated. 

As for amenities and supplies, it has everything you could need for a brief or extended stay in the Monterey area. There is a full kitchen stocked with dinnerware and appliances. There is a stackable washer/dryer for any laundry you wish to do. They had even stocked the refrigerator and pantry with some basic needs. For our trip it was the perfect place and we would happily choose to stay there again in the future. 

Location is important and this one is walking distance from many shops and restaurants on Lighthouse Ave in Pacific Grove and the beautiful coastline is also a short walk from the property. Many of the areas primary tourist destinations can be reached in a 10-15 minute drive. 

If you are traveling with children, one bonus for the property that I don't recall being mentioned in the listing is a small park directly across the street with a playground. 

A very warranted FIVE STAR review!"
11210583,105725381,2016-10-02,15122402,Solène,Nous avons ete ravies par le bungalow! Nos hotes Michele et Kathryn  etaient tres sympatiques et elles se sont montrees flexibles pour les heures de check in et de check out. Le bungalow est tres chaleureux et confortable. Nous pouvions meme voir une famille de biches dans le jardin avoisinant lors de  nos petit-dejeuners! Nous recommandons cet endroit. Nous y retournerons sans hesiter!
11210583,107503262,2016-10-10,278492,Rebecca,"This little bungalow was perfect for our family. The location could not have been better. Even though we have been coming to the Monterey area for years, staying here allowed us to broaden our horizons and explore more widely. It was nice to have a kitchen and eating area for breakfasts and lunches, rather than having to go out for every meal. Their recommendations for places to go were excellent as well. "
11210583,113739259,2016-11-13,83141424,Nick,"Adorable place, PERFECT location for hanging by the beach, grabbing a bite nearby, or seeing the aquarium. Michele was so friendly and helpful."
11210583,115722088,2016-11-26,20528526,Greg,"Michele was a fantastic host - she made me feel right at home, and the cottage was a perfect getaway for the weekend! I would love to stay again!"
11210583,127377226,2017-01-17,34959631,Bret,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11210583,133179313,2017-02-20,99226982,Tasha,"This cottage was really a nice cozy place to stay for a weekend getaway to Pacific Grove/ Carmel/ Monterey.  It really is a bungalow and as such is on the smaller side but so cute.

Our host met us at the place and it was an easy walk through. If we needed anything, she was just a text away! Checkout was simple too. Extra towels and linens were easy to find.

The place is small but there is enough room for a family of four to move about. The front bedroom is a good size right off the living area and has a closet and dresser for storing your things. The second bedroom is snug. We had four adults for the weekend and the second bedroom is a tight fit if both people are trying to do anything inside. It is also right off the kitchen with a double door so it isn't the most private of spaces.
This place would be ideal for a family with children who don't mind sharing a bed.

We cooked a few meals while we were there and found it to mostly meet our needs, fitting 2 cooks in the kitchen without too much trouble but as is typical in an older home, the kitchen has very little counter space.

The dining area in the back of the house is cute and multi-functional. The table folds out to seat 4 and there is a washer/dryer available which would be super handy if you were at the beach all day and needed to dry towels, etc. For us it was cold and rainy, so not such great beach weather!

There is a large front yard for relaxing on a sunny day and a big backyard that looked like it could be a lot of fun if only it was dry and beautifully sunny.

The bungalow is located right across the street from a great park for kids so bring the sports equipment if your kids want to escape! The street is quiet and very residential and we probably would have walked around more if it hadn't been raining. Downtown Pacific Grove is about a 5 minute walk and the scenic and lovely Lovers Point is equally close.

Overall we had a great stay and definitely recommend if you are looking for a cute, casual getaway removed from the bustle of touristy Monterey but close enough to walk to all the attractions like the Aquarium, Cannery Row...etc. 17 Mile Drive was close and there are so many golf courses within a 5 min drive.."
11210583,139840574,2017-03-26,110195726,Alison,"We had a lovely time at the beautiful little bungalow. There were even two deer sleeping in the backyard on Saturday morning. This was such a treat! PG is a very special place and it was so wonderful to be able to share some of that magic with my family. The hosts were very prompt to respond to my inquiries and are great communicators. I would recommend this for a small family with kids. Great location, so much fun to be had within walking distance."
11210583,145292549,2017-04-17,12286380,Mark,"We loved staying in this beautiful bungalow. The location was great - one block to shops and restaurants and about three blocks to the beach in the other direction. There is an amazing park across the street. Yet, it was still so quiet at night. We really enjoyed staying here. It was so colorful and comforting. Michele provided everything we needed and much more. Highly recommend. Perfect!"
11210583,146794321,2017-04-23,10811977,Dale,"This bungalow was bright, clean and colorful.  A great little park with a full playground across the street.  Lovers point was an easy stroll and a great place to watch the sun set.  Don't miss brunch at the red house!  And finally when we woke up to put on coffee, we saw a young buck deer laying behind the window.  Beautiful and relaxed weekend!"
11210583,148374187,2017-04-30,27171428,Cindy,My friends and I had a wonderful stay! Very close to the beach. Bungalow was totally enough space for a party of four people. Michele provided us with everything we needed. 
11210583,157805419,2017-06-04,41427980,Connie,"My husband, his brother and I stayed at this cute little bungalow for 3 nights. Michele's was easy to work with and she's truly thought of everything. If you stay here I encourage you to bring you bikes. We rode ours everyday and the bike trail along the ocean is just a couple blocks from the house. The aquarium and cannery row are only a short bike ride away - less than 15 minutes, along one of the most beautiful paths in the USA. "
11210583,164308399,2017-06-26,36481675,Annette,"The only thing I didn't like about staying at the bungalow was the fact that I had to leave and go home. The house itself is adorable and cozy, you feel at home immediately.  The location between the ocean and restaurants is fantastic and Michele is a beautiful, kind hostess who supplied everything we could need. Hope to return one day."
11210583,166868699,2017-07-04,15620958,Sarah,"We loved our stay in this adorable cottage. It is even cuter in person than in the pics with lovely decor and landscaping. It was clean, cozy, and comfortable for our family of three. Communication with the host was easy and quick. The house was very clean and we appreciated all the little extras - coffee, tea, crackers, bottled water, fruit, lots of extra blankets, and nice bathroom products. The location was excellent - on a quiet street across from a big playground, a few blocks from the beach, and just a block from restaurants and cafes. We hardly needed to use our car. Thanks for a great stay! "
11210583,171073672,2017-07-16,29647769,Min-Sun,"Great location on a quiet street. We walk to Passion Fish for dinner and Red House Cafe for breakfast. Easy walk to the beach. The bungalow was a tiny house, but we were comfortable. Michele was very friendly, and provided us with coffee, bottle water and snacks. If you are going to cook meals, and traveling with kids, this house might be not be big enough. For a short weekend trip for grown ups, it was perfect."
11210583,173740208,2017-07-23,72172966,Brenda,"The bungalow was in the perfect location for us! We walked into town everyday. Accommodations were great- we appreciated the thoughtfulness of cheese, fresh fruit and sparkling waters. Two bedrooms were ideal for the four of us and wasn't cramped at all. We were able to cook many of our meals when we didn't walk to the local spots. 
Communicative hosts that stayed in touch but didn't bother us with too much touch bases. Had lots of great suggestions for shopping and dining."
11210583,174705773,2017-07-26,57824330,Kristi,"From the moment we walked in the arbor-covered gate & into this darling cottage, we relaxed & felt at home."
11210583,177752714,2017-08-03,117521719,Jim,"Great neighborhood. Beautiful, quiet, and within walking distance of everything in Pacific Grove, plus Cannery Row. A surprisingly great find at the last minute. Perfect for a couple."
11210583,184927560,2017-08-20,27532797,Tommi,"We stayed in Michele's beautiful cottage during car week in Monterey.  We really enjoyed the home with its convenience to the events as well as to all the great shopping and eating within walking distance!  Michele did a fantastic job of making us feel at home and comfortable.  If the opportunity arises, we would definitely stay here again!"
11210583,191494296,2017-09-07,135729511,Christopher,"We were happy to find this charming cottage when we decided it was too smoky in Yosemite for our 3-month-old granddaughter.  Love the ocean air in Pacific Grove!  The bungalow is just a few minutes' walk from Lovers Point Park.      We enjoyed hanging out in the nice front yard, which is sheltered from the street (not much traffic on this street anyway).  Michele is a congenial, bubbly host.  Ask her about the butterfly-kids sculpture in front of the post office!"
11210583,202069593,2017-10-09,18828421,Valerie,"This little bungalow is a happy place. It’s clean, cozy, comfortable and cheerful. The location is wonderful. Pick a direction and head off on foot. One way leads to the ocean with a fantastic walking path, and the other is right up the block from the heart of town with wonderful restaurants and shopping. There’s a nice park and playground across the street, but the  bungalow is quiet. We had a wonderful weekend here. I didn’t want to leave. It’s a terrific find."
11210583,204171456,2017-10-16,118697875,Liz,Thanks for your help Michelle. We loved staying at your place.
11210583,221762445,2017-12-27,163016375,Chelsea,"Michele was a friendly and communicative host. Her house was stylish, full of amenities, and a true retreat. It was perfectly located. We appreciate having a new home away from home."
11210583,223824459,2018-01-01,18920455,Sergio,"We really enjoyed the days we spent in this nice little house. Michelle was very kind and attentive. The house is beautiful, warm, cozy, and perfectly equipped for all needs. Michelle had the nice touch of leaving us drinks and fruit in the refrigerator plus coffee and cookies. The house is not only beautiful but also very well located, close to walking to very good restaurants and cafes in the most beautiful street of Pacific Grove. The beach is also a few minutes away walking. And if you arrive by car you have space on the street to park it without problems and you can use it to know Monterey and Carmel which are minutes away by car. Definitely a recommended place to stay if you want to know and enjoy the area."
11210583,234429671,2018-02-12,93063922,Jennifer,The host canceled this reservation 103 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11210583,245107488,2018-03-20,19141435,Bhaskar,"Michele was a wonderful and communicative host. We loved staying in her bungalow in a quiet neighborhood in Pacific Grove. Appreciated the location and quick walks to the local bookstore, coffeeshop, waterfront and restaurants. We really appreciated the thoughtful touches (e.g. fruit, biscuits etc that we made good use of during our hikes) and her quick responses. Very helpful local tips. Perfect lodging for small family."
11210583,247493828,2018-03-28,37091276,Kelly,"Great location to the water/walking trail and restaurants. Two bedrooms on quiet street across from a park, which might be great for toddlers. Very comfortable bed in the front bedroom."
11210583,250345918,2018-04-04,163016375,Chelsea,We are repeat guests. Love the location. Perfect house for our family of three. Hope to be back again!
11210583,251924505,2018-04-08,15620958,Sarah,"This was our second time staying in this lovely cottage. It is very nicely decorated and has everything you need for a weekend getaway - kitchen, small yard, bbq, etc. We appreciated the nice touches such as plenty of towels, shampoo and conditioner, crackers, sparkling water, and fruit. The location couldn't be better, with park, beach, restaurants, and shops all within walking distance."
11219617,69812247,2016-04-13,6885144,Brad And Jennifer,"Great place with a lot of space and a wonderful fireplace.  We enjoyed the spacious yard, and the well equipped kitchen (and we like to cook). Close to convinces like Trader Joes and such, and an easy drive to downtown Pacific Grove or Monterey. Overall a nice place to stay!"
11219617,76237397,2016-05-25,41291686,Charles,"Don's house is outstanding. The property is comfortably furnished and very clean. The house looked better than the pictures. The outdoor living space is private and ample. The location of the property, while in Pacific Grove, is on the fringe of Pebble Peach, as well as Monterey. We had a few dinners in Carmel, and the property is situated close to highway 68 that takes you right there. We liked this house and location so much, we spoke with Don about renting it for 18 months, but other bookings precluded us from making a deal. I highly recommend this house for anyone staying in the peninsula more than a couple of days. "
11219617,86519793,2016-07-16,8587241,Susan,"Don was wonderful!  We had great communication, house was spotless, kitchen well equipped, lovely furnishings, beautiful back garden and patio.  Restaurant and sightseeing information was provided for us.  House was also well located.
I would highly recommend this house."
11219617,88589118,2016-07-24,7038369,Paul,"Don was very communicative and made sure we had clear directions to enter the property without any problems. Their home was wonderfully equipped with everything we needed and was very well decorated and tastefully remodeled. We are very particular about design and their home really hit the mark. The photos were very accurate and most importantly the house was very comfortable indoors and out. A nice neighborhood with with mixed properties(some much nicer than others, Don's house being one of the really nice ones)but the location was incredible. Close proximity to everything you want to do in the Monterey/Pacific Grove/Carmel area. We will stay here again, super nice and quiet, a lovely place. Thank you!"
11219617,91255065,2016-08-04,11053365,Amiee,"Very lovely home, and although we had a minor mishap when we arrived, it was not something that was the fault of the owners, and they did everything they could to rectify the situation immediately. The house was very lovey, well maintained and comfortable. Also, very well organized, so it was easy to find things, because it all made sense! That is nice when you're in a place that's not your own. We especially loved the backyard, which our kids practically lived in when we were not out enjoying the sites of Monterey and Pacific Grove. A great place to relax, and to enjoy a cook out with the family. The kitchen is large and well equipped, if you want to cook up a storm. The only bad thing about recommending this rental, is that it will be less available the next time we want to stay. "
11219617,107960064,2016-10-13,40415376,Jennifer,"This was one of our favorite air bnb stays  (we've had quite a few). 
The home is modern, tastefully decorated, clean, and is located in a quiet & super convenient location. We felt sad to leave and would definitely stay here again. "
11219617,109177707,2016-10-19,9992491,Viktoria,"This is a beautiful place with everything you could want for a peaceful and relaxing vacation. The place looks at least as wonderful as in the photos if not better. The entire place is tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The backyard is like a private oasis, with beautiful plants. it's a wonderful place to enjoy your morning coffee from the large sunny deck. Trader Joe's is just a couple of blocks away, as well as Safeway, and Starbucks. The place is less than five minutes from Lover's Point, and extremely close to both Monterey and Carmel. I would recommend this place with out any hesitation. Our host, Don, was very responsive, check in and out was a breeze and we even got to know one of our neighbors, a lovely couple next door. Don did a wonderful job making us feel right at home the second we pulled up to the house by assuring easy check in and quick communication. He even recommended a great place to have our first dinner out. We really appreciate his hospitality and hope to return."
11219617,131583483,2017-02-12,111285894,Matthew,Loved the house for our family of 5...backyard is amazing 
11219617,133327435,2017-02-21,100264429,Jerry,Loved our time at this wonderful home! Thank you Don and Deborah for sharing this great place with us! We so appreciated all the household items that you provided for us while we were guests there! All these things made our stay very comfortable. This property was very peaceful and serene! It was a great location for vacationers like us! We left with wonderful memories and hope to be back again in the future!
11219617,136610980,2017-03-11,29412371,Sabrina,"🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖I can't say more about getting to stay at your place. It's was such a blessing! So beautifully decorated, fantastic beds and linens, clean, comfortable, peaceful, quite yet close to everything. We enjoyed our stay so much. We can't wait to come back! No more hotels for us!!"
11219617,140952983,2017-04-01,95561752,Kathryn & Andrew," We had a great week in Pacific Grove and are already planning another trip to see all we didn't have time for on this trip! Loved the yard, patio, art and book collection, too. Fantastic showers and bathtub! Comfortable beds, pillows, etc. Super functional kitchen. There is a outside grill but we didn't use it. Immaculate. Highly recommended, especially for families of four ... kids each had own bed and bath, what a treat! "
11219617,144384824,2017-04-15,85768925,Nicole,"We really enjoyed our stay at Don's place. It was a great home for us to stay with our two children - we were so glad we picked this more spacious home, as we spent more time there with our little ones. The home is beautifully updated, well-maintained and the needs of guests has been well-considered. The backyard is amazing. The location worked well for us, it was a quiet street, and very near to Safeway and Trader Joe's, which was great for us because we cooked at home in the evenings so the kids could get to bed early.  The kitchen is great and had everything we needed. We enjoy walking, and had no problem walking from the house into Pacific Grove, Monterey and Asilomar Beach. It is a short walk to get a great sandwich at Compagno's, or a delicious macaron at Bechler's. It was a wonderful trip and we would definitely stay at Don's place again! "
11219617,149747388,2017-05-05,32766192,Susanna,"Don and Deborah's house is a warm, comfortable catch with everything you could need. The kitchen is great for those who like to cook and the back deck is perfect for outdoor eating. We stayed here for the Big Sur Marathon and wanted somewhere cozy and relaxing for downtime. We slept wonderfully in the comfortable beds and the bathrooms were very upscale and user friendly. The backyard is like a secret garden. We loved all of the succulents. We would stay here again if we are in the area."
11219617,156121504,2017-05-29,122135302,Isaac,"Don's House in Pacific Grove is awesome! The pictures don't quite do it justice. The bedrooms are very nice and the kitchen is fantastic! We liked to do a lot of our own meals and a nice kitchen really made it so much more fun! But even better than just the great house was the awesome location! Pacific Grove is very pretty, and its right in between Carmel By the Sea and Monterey which made any destination of ours super easy to get to! If you're headed to that area, I think Don's house would be an excellent choice. We will definitely book again if we are ever in the area."
11219617,161737068,2017-06-18,59160778,Doug,"Great house in great location. Very central to Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, Point Lobos, 17-mile drive, and Del Monte beach. Also very close to grocery (Safeway and Trader Joe's). House very clean, well appointed, and well supplied. Had a fantastic stay!"
11219617,164313210,2017-06-26,65388111,Lauren,"Great responsiveness on Don's part. The house is well equipped with everything needed for your stay and is an easy walk to charming downtown PG. It's also convenient to markets for stocking up on food. Be sure to look at the recommendations for local restaurants. For a special night out, we enjoyed Fifi's. Pavel's remains a favorite for breakfast pastry or a lunchtime cubano sandwich -- to die for bread. Looking forward to my next visit already. "

11256490,67223859,2016-03-27,16292407,Joecel,"The pictures don't do this place justice! Such a cozy, cute house that is central to absolutely everything. My family and I stayed here for Easter weekend and it was such a huge convenience to have everything either walking distance or just a 2-3 min drive away. Would definitely stay here again!"
11256490,71493918,2016-04-25,44123410,Craig,"Great location in Pacific Grove, away from the tourists in Monteray but a 2 minute drive.  Stylish beach house with a great kitchen and outdoor cooking area.  Host is well organized and takes great pride in the quality of her home"
11256490,74368621,2016-05-15,48629052,Wen,This house was PERFECT!! It is very well maintained and clean. The living area is very comfortable. The kitchen has just been renovated with high end appliances. The bathrooms and bedroom was very spacious. The the deck area is very cute. All in all a wonderful experience.
11256490,81441338,2016-06-23,73666488,Brian,"Wendi's place was white-picket-fence-perfect! The house is clean, comfortable, surprisingly spacious, and situated in a charming (the only way to describe PG!) neighborhood. The location is tough to beat; two blocks to the ocean in one direction, two blocks to downtown PG with all its great restaurants and shopping in the other direction. It's also an easy walk (less than a mile) down the gorgeous oceanfront recreation trail (and past the resting harbor seals) to Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Another mile gets you to Fisherman's Wharf and all downtown Monterey has to offer. And you're just a short drive from Carmel, Pebble Beach, 17-Mile Drive, and the majestic Big Sur coastline. This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was one to remember. Can't wait to do it again. Thanks, Wendi!"
11256490,85982392,2016-07-14,33818974,Paula,Our stay at Wendi's place was wonderful!   The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance to town and a great walking path to nearby areas along the water.  We travelled across the country from the East coast and were concerned about what we would need to be comfortable in the house ... the only thing we needed to buy was groceries!  Wendi had all the comforts of home in her clean and well-appointed house.  Would definitely do it again! 
11256490,89420515,2016-07-28,15572855,Gwen,"When we 1st saw Wendi's pictures of the beach cottage on Airbnb, we immediately liked it.  But once we arrived, we absolutely fell in love with it!!  From the white picket fences, to the flower boxes and the exposed deck....and inside, the built in bench at the bay windows, to the bright and cozy dining room.  The master bedroom was large and comfortable.  But my favorite room in the house was the kitchen...Love...Love...Love!!!  Such a beautiful kitchen.  Cooking on the Viking stove was such a treat!  Now I want a Viking stove for my house too!  The kitchen was well stocked with everything you can possible need.  The whole house was clean and well taken care of.  The only issue we had was when we arrived we noticed that the shower in the guest bathroom wasn't working bc the knob had been detached.  But it wasn't a true problem because we were still able to shower in the master bathroom.
I recommend this lovely beach cottage to everyone who wants to visit PG/Monterey.  The cottage is 1.5 blocks to the beach, 2 blocks to downtown PG and a easy and beautiful walk to Cannery row.  We can't wait to come back to PG/Monterey.  We know where we will stay....Thanks Wendi for sharing your lovely home with us!!"
11256490,90665040,2016-08-01,17115327,Diana,"We had an amazing 3 days and 2 nights at this gorgeous beach house with our 4 year old son who loved it too. The home was spacious, spotless, cozy and comfortable with every amenity you could think of. It is a beautiful special place. The location is fabulous - a very close walk to the ocean as well as the historic downtown core. 

Wendi was very communicative before and during our stay and there is an information packet in the home as well. She had lots of grey suggestions.  We felt well taken care of. Parking is easy and available right on the street in front of the house. 

Pacific Grove is a quiet, charming, picturesque place with historic character homes and fabulous restaurants (Red House and Passionfish plus Toasties for breakfast). We were lucky enough to be there for the Feast Of Lanterns (to our surprise!) so we enjoyed fireworks and special activities. We walked out to the lighthouse along the water and it was beautiful with a wild ocean, rocks, seals and birds. 

We also rented a Surrey bicycle and checked out Moneterey though we preferred Pacific Grove much better (less touristy, more authentic, prettier and less busy) - there are some great big beaches by Monterey however and we enjoyed the sand and dipping our toes in the cold water. 

We also did the 17 mile drive on our way out which was a great experience and great for lots of pictures. 

It was a little foggier and cooler in the mornings and evenings than we expected and it takes a bit longer for the fog to burn off in Pacific Grove. However the fog is also very beautiful and made for a great atmosphere. All in all, it was one of our best Airbnb stays and I was so glad one of my clients recommended this hidden gem of a town to visit! "
11256490,97409219,2016-08-27,6845043,Katie,"Wendi's beach house is a gem! Great, walkable location to many of Pacific Grove and Monterrey's activities and sites. Super clean and cute, and outfitted with many things that you may need for a stay, even a pack and play for our small baby. It makes for a fantastic place to live while attending a conference at the nearby Asilomar facilities, rather than staying on conference grounds. Wendi was great to deal with and very responsive. "
11256490,101653073,2016-09-14,67280232,Jennifer,"This beach house is just beautiful and felt like home. 
We traveled with our 18 month old and he enjoyed having extra room to play around vs. staying in a hotel. There were even high chair and toys available.
Everything you need is in the house, the kitchen is well stocked. we enjoyed having coffee and breakfast every morning in the dinning room, which was filled with natural light. The days we stayed were a bit cold, so we didn't utilize the patio outside. However, one afternoon as we leave the house, there were a deer in the front yard... way awesome!

The location is excellent! We took morning and afternoon walk by the beach. Wendi was more than helpful, we had a little problem with the door and she is very responsive and friendly.

11256490,102923605,2016-09-19,79292704,Susan,Looking forward to booking again next year.  My stay was wonderful.  
11256490,104710764,2016-09-28,1111143,Dianne,"We fell immediatly in love with Wendi's cottage. While being cute as a button the cottage has been upgraded just enough, with tasteful decor and history all around you. Very clean and comfortable and convenient. Wendi was very attentive and kind.
We hope to return soon!

11256490,105845456,2016-10-03,2164248,Gin,"I had a great weekend in Monterey staying at Wendi's home. The house is so cute and cozy, we actually spent a good amount of time inside. There's a patio in the front and the back where we would make breakfast and eat outside in the mornings. The kitchen has everything you need, just bring your own food. Location was great! Downtown Pacific Grove was around the block. Lover's Point was a few streets down. And Cannery Row was walking distance as well. It's a beautiful neighborhood to be in. I would definitely come back to Wendi's home when I visit Monterey next time."
11256490,107472630,2016-10-10,97445082,Terri,"My husband and I loved the Historic Stylish Beach House!  Wendi was expedient in answering questions and sending information related to our stay.  The house & neighborhood were charming, the kitchen was very well appointed, and the black & white bathroom was beautiful!  I only wish we had more time to enjoy all the amenities and rooms in and outside the house, and to share them with friends.  It was apparent that the owner takes much pride in the property and pays attention to the details.  We would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to others!"
11256490,109973752,2016-10-23,436777,Adam,Loved the perfect location!  Our car didn't move once we parked it upon arrival.  
11256490,113776687,2016-11-13,87466384,Nicholas,Wendi's cottage was AMAZING! We had such a great time we would definitely visit again. Close to everything. Couldn't have asked for a better weekend!
11256490,115555381,2016-11-25,58274867,Robert,"Picture-perfect place in Pacific Grove, 2 blocks from the ocean. Walkable to downtown PG for groceries and restaurants, walkable to Lover's Point beach. "
11256490,116056141,2016-11-27,58020560,Phillip,Place is newly remodeled and very clean.  I was surprised with how close the place was or the bay.  Area is very safe and easy to find.  Thank you for letting us stay and I will recommend others in the future.
11256490,121382705,2016-12-16,11474225,Deborah Geesey,"wonderful, stay , could stay a whole week , thank you"

11256490,134297991,2017-02-26,33896367,Kelly,"This cottage was amazing. It is well equipped and extremely comfortable. The beach is just a short walk away. There are restaurants and shopping a little further away but definitely walkable. And Carmel is just a few minutes drive via highway or via the gorgeous 17 Mile Drive. But the cottage is so comfortable, you don't need to leave it to enjoy yourself. The washer and dryer were very convenient. The kitchen is very well equipped and we cooked many meals instead of dining out. The neighborhood was very peaceful. We hope too return in the future. "
11256490,135704210,2017-03-05,1031179,Chris,My family and I loved staying at Wendi's home. The location is just minutes from Lovers Point in one direction and steps away from shops and restaurants on the other. Her home is very well decorated with a fun beach theme. We enjoyed the decks in the morning and evenings in both the from and back of her home. Her kitchen is well stocked with basics and appliances. Thank you again for a wonderful stay!
11256490,138385191,2017-03-19,89898083,Mark,"Great location, and a perfect house for our family weekend get away."
11256490,140234974,2017-03-28,7027781,Steve,"We have stayed at the Beach house several times, and it is - hands-down - our favorite place to stay on the Monterey Peninsula.  It's very spacious for two people.  It's decorated and appointed like a real home, rather than a rental.  (Note the Viking range.)  It's very comfortable and easy walking distance to restaurants in Pacific Grove as well as a short walk to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

If the Beach house isn't available when we want to go to Pacific Grove, we reschedule our trip."
11256490,141366646,2017-04-02,2767382,Lisa,"The best of all possible worlds: walking distance to everything, yet a quiet and comfortable place to land at the end of the day. The home had lovely touches inside, from the beautiful kitchen to nightlights in the bathrooms to the picnic table outside to Adirondack chairs in the front yard--so much attention to detail and so close to everything. We loved our weekend get away, and will definitely be staying at Wendi's place again! "
11256490,142117705,2017-04-06,4391825,Nancy,"Wendi's place is absolutely wonderful!  It is very clean, has a fantastic kitchen, and very comfortable.  It is also located centrally in Pacific Grove - near the beach and walking path, within walking distance to the restaurants in Pacific Grove as well as the Monterey Bay Aquarium and all the shops on Cannery Row.  It was so convenient and beautiful to walk along the walking path along the ocean to get to Cannery Row.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip in the area!"
11256490,144110371,2017-04-14,117147661,Kelli,Excellent. Will stay there the next time we head to pacific grove...
11256490,150382240,2017-05-07,4498423,Stephanie,"Beautiful home tucked away on a quiet street - walking distance to everything! 

Better suited for 2 people or a family with kids; we were 2 couples and there is only one bed and one pull out couch. The pull out couch is pretty uncomfortable, so just plan for that! But the kitchen is completely stocked to cook a meal no problem! And it has a nice back patio to enjoy the sunshine. We loved our stay in Pacific Grove! "
11256490,151389763,2017-05-12,2721146,Chelsea,"Wendi was a great host and the beach cottage was such a delightful home base while in Pacific Grove.  The cottage is in such a perfect location; we walked to breakfast each morning, and you are close to everything, but the street is super quiet and quaint.  I was amazed at how close it is to the aquarium and Cannery Row.  The cottage's historic charm draws you in and we enjoyed it so much that spent one whole day just reading and hanging out at the cottage.  The multiple outdoor gathering areas add to the enjoyment, and I loved having the picket fence, which made it comfortable for us to let our three-year-old run around outside.  The kitchen is very well equipped with lots of cooking utensils and it's worth checking to see what's in stock before going grocery shopping.  One thing to note is that the bed is quite firm, so you should be aware of that if you're a sensitive sleeper.  We loved the beach cottage and would highly recommend it for your stay in Pacific Grove!"
11256490,152068872,2017-05-14,39144775,Marc,"Wendi 's home was beautiful, in the middle of downtown, right next to the beach and pretty close to all the sites in Monterey. I loved the yard and the deck chairs for lounging, and my parents loved the cozy bedroom!"
11256490,153684378,2017-05-21,104973246,Maxx,This was a wonderful home to stay in. A short walk to downtown PG and lovers point ( even with a 3 year old). The house was fully equipped with everything you need to feel at home. Would definelty stay here again. 
11256490,157107819,2017-06-02,89407959,Erin,We had such a great stay at this beautiful beach cottage. My young boys slept in the living room perfectly and we all loved the neighborhood. 
11256490,157858736,2017-06-04,24338938,Karine,"Wendi's place was perfect: close to everything yet quiet, huge space, extremely well furnished kitchen, and seamless communication and process. I highly recommend Wendi's place!"

11256490,162431992,2017-06-20,109029487,Carrie,"This is a wonderful cottage perfectly situated in Pacific Grove.  Two blocks to the beach and an easy walk to downtown PG and into Monterey.   Nestled in a serene setting this cottage was the perfect spot for our stay in Pacific Grove.  You will love the easy access to everything - from shops to restaurants to the aquarium.  We loved cooking in the wonderfully equipped kitchen and spending lots of time reading, chatting and drinking in the sights and sounds of this special town.  Cheers to Wendi and her hospitality!"
11256490,163936609,2017-06-25,93858589,Eddie,"Wendi's place is wonderful and well located in Pacific Grove for adventures on the coast and in Monterey Bay. Our family of four stayed comfortably and her home is superbly furnished. I highly recommend her place and when in PG in the future, we'll be sure to stay here again. "
11256490,166552883,2017-07-03,1325248,Blake,"Wendi's home in Pacific Grove is truly the best of the best when it comes to Airbnbs. You can see the ocean at the end of the block - does it get better than that? It was a home away from home during our long weekend in Monterey. The best thing about her home was that it was SO clean. Additionally, the kitchen was exceptionally well-equipped and made it easy for us to cook some great meals on our trip. Street parking was easy and even though it was cold and cloudy during our trip, we really enjoyed having a morning cup of tea on the outside desk. So convenient - 10 stars! "
11256490,171134580,2017-07-16,63160033,Angela,"Pacific Grove is lovely 20 minute walk to Cannery Row /The Aquarium. We loved walking daily. The home is very comfortable, in a lovely neighbourhood. Wendy gave us great suggestions for restaurants. We found it a great spot for scenic drives to Big Sur/ Carmel. We only wish we could have stayed longer."
11256490,174942421,2017-07-27,117300564,Rolf,"Ein wunderschönes Haus in einer traumhaften Umgebung. Der Preis ist für die größe, Aussattung und Lage des Hauses absolut angemessen. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und wären gerne noch etwas länger geblieben."

I walked to my favorite breakfast spot along the water each day with the kids while my husband played golf.  Everyone was happy.  

I will definitely look to stay here again in the future! Oh, I was amazed to see you had a coffee grinder!! Major plus because I travel with my own beans. 

Loved every second spent here!! 

Thank you!
The Lange Family"

11256490,204362437,2017-10-17,154399435,Alanna,This house was beautiful and in a great location. We did the 17 mile drive and enjoyed some time at Asilomar Beach. Breakfast at Red House was awesome. Highly recommend this house and host :)
11256490,205813022,2017-10-22,46892573,Sharon,All my prior comments to Wendi can and should be shared with future guests! The little house is quaint and perfectly reflects the history and charm of this gorgeous coastal area! You'll love this cottage.
11256490,208718813,2017-11-02,134541022,Marion,"The info given on the website is very accurate. Check in is easy.  There are two places you can sit out plus the garden. Walking distance to everything you need, sea, food, museums, art galleries even Cannery Row. We even saw two deer outside the house, yes the neighbourhood is quiet.  Folks say hello when they pass, great area. Go and enjoy."
11256490,209701339,2017-11-05,19248303,Clark,"Wendi's place is a super cute historic house a few blocks from the ocean. Pacific Grove is great, just a few blocks from restaurants etc. Super clean and comfortable. We'd stay again."
11256490,227672065,2018-01-15,10149867,Rob,Awesome place in a wonderful spot. One block to the ocean and easy access to all that Pacific Grove offers. We will definitely be back next time we're planning a trip to Monterey!

The kitchen was well stocked so we can enjoy breakfast in the morning and make simple meals. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, and was able to enjoy a walk to Lovers Point. Would definitely come back here again!"
11305882,67363724,2016-03-28,23167166,Andrew,The host canceled this reservation 82 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11305882,71255236,2016-04-24,11131200,Jonathan,Great house! A perfect getaway just 2 blocks from the ocean. Our host had a nice welcome sign for us as well as tickets to the aquarium (which we took advantage of). We were also doing the Big Sur Marathon so she was more than happy to give us a late checkout time. I would highly recommend coming here again.
11305882,72396612,2016-05-02,19139098,Clare,"Its really a beautiful house! The house is tidy and clean. The location is prefect and the neighbors are very quiet. My parents liked walking to the sea in the morning. Heather did a lot of things for us, even give me and my families a big surprise for congratulations my graduation. Also, she has prepared Monterey Aquarium season passes for guests in advance. I will recommend to my friends! Thanks Heather : )"
11305882,74508697,2016-05-15,46594730,Jim,"From the moment we arrived to this charming cottage we felt at home.  We were surprised by the unmentioned beautiful view of the bay as we entered the living room. The home is well stocked and comfortable, we enjoyed sitting by the gas fireplace outside drinking a nice glass of wine they left in honor of our Mom's birthday we were celebrating, an added special touch by Heather. Spending the day using the provided Aquarium passes was a plus, and we could walk right down the street to the bluff that ran along the coastal edge to see the Sea Lions hanging out on the rocks. Very close to town with great food and little shops. A perfect location for a relaxing trip away from the crowds, tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. We would definitely come back here, it was perfect!"
11305882,75733582,2016-05-22,35810230,Lindsey,"Heather's place was amazing!! My girlfriend and I were in town for a weekend getaway and we had the most amazing time. The house is adorable, we loved the fireplace in the back yard and how close it was to the ocean and aquarium. Heather was a perfect host!  We look forward to coming back soon!"
11305882,77208270,2016-05-30,19538562,Brian,"My wife, in-laws, and I rented Heather's beautiful cottage for Memorial Day weekend.  The space was quiet, comfortable, clean, and perfectly well-equipped for our needs. The ocean was three blocks away, and we enjoyed morning jogs and evening strolls along the cliff side.  The fireplace in the backyard was an treat as well.  Don't think we could have picked a better spot for a Monterey retreat.  The guest passes to the aquarium as well!  We'll be back :)

11305882,84045219,2016-07-05,45027082,Jeff,Heather was a wonderful host! Her home was so cozy and the backyard was absolutely perfect for a 4th of July weekend.  She left us plenty of useful items such as towels and first aid kits. She also left us 4 passes to the monterrey Bay aquarium!!
11305882,86471715,2016-07-16,60676217,Jim,"The cottage was wonderful and we appreciated Heather's bottle of local wine as a welcome gift. The cottage was just as described and the perfect size for my wife and I. The kitchen was incredibly stocked with an amazing array of items and the beds were extremely comfortable! I haven't slept that well in quite awhile. The neighborhood is packed in pretty tight, but it is so quiet and peaceful. Nice to have a peek of the bay out the front window. We were shocked to see deer walking down the street. Apparently, that's normal!  The guest passes to the Aquarium were wonderful ( otherwise $50 each to get in!).  Having a private driveway was also very convenient as parking in and around town can be a challenge.  The cottage location was so convenient to nearly everything... just 3 blocks to the ocean, close to the Wharf, and a long walk to downtown Pacific Grove. 
We had an incredible stay and are glad Heather's cottage was part of our fond memories."
11305882,87524512,2016-07-20,10144902,Linsey,"This is a lovely house - very peaceful, yet the ocean is just a block away. You're right at the end (or the start!) of the famous 17 Mile Drive too. Heather was a friendly and helpful host, the house was spotlessly clean, beautifully presented and very comfortable. 
The Monterey Aquarium passes (within ocean front walking distance, with seals, pelicans and other birds all along the route) are a fantastic extra bonus. We walked across the peninsula to watch the sun go down one evening and saw a family of deer, quietly sharing the neighbourhood.  
Pacific Grove is absolutely charming. A blessed place - I really wish we could have stayed much longer. "
11305882,89304674,2016-07-27,35165216,Phil,Heather was a great host providing clear advice and guidance for the property and the surround area. The cottage is located in Pacific Grove and it's short 25 minute walk (along the coast) to the Monterey Aquarium. There's also plenty of Uber-X in the area if you want to get around by car. The cottage itself is in great condition with everything you need (including lots of off street parking). We really enjoyed out stay there!
11305882,96457595,2016-08-22,12925417,Richard,"great experience. 
Highly recommend. "
11305882,97507961,2016-08-27,46937789,Tracy,"Loved staying at the cottage, it was in a quiet neighbourhood with a 2min walk down to the costal path into Monterey.  The aquarium tickets were a bonus.  The walk to Monterey aquarium took us about 25minutes, a little further than we anticipated but the walk was lovely and very interesting, we were seal and sea otter spotting all the way!
The house was really well equipped and we loved the fire pit in the garden. Would definitely recommend staying here."
11305882,98753588,2016-09-01,87870363,Simon,"We loved staying at Heather's place. The house is super and we spent some nice time sitting in the sun out the back. It's in a great location - we went to the aquarium and really liked running the trail round to Asilomar beach, looking in the rock pools.   
Heather was spot-on with communication and had everything ready when we got there. A really good start for our first airbnb. Would love to have stayed longer."
11305882,99700276,2016-09-05,6824439,Vicki,"We loved staying at Heathers cottage. It was clean, tidy, incredibly comfortable and beautifully decorated. Nothing but good things to say about our stay. Highly recommended. "
11305882,103135281,2016-09-20,31228350,Gemma,"We lived staying at Heather's place. She was really helpful, quick to respond and her house was fantastic.  The location was brilliant - 5 mins walk from the beach, 30 min walk to the Aquarium and she has so many personal touches that made you feel v welcome. Woukd 100% stay there again"
11305882,106011810,2016-10-03,57238196,Nikolay,It was fantastic from all points of view...:)
11305882,157859233,2017-06-04,24175414,Ishan,"Heather's place was beautiful and located in a quiet, safe and beautiful neighborhood. The house was well equipped and very cozy. The best part was the gas firepit outside!"
11305882,166873274,2017-07-04,6318784,Chris,"Heather was an incredible host. First class communication, entry to house was straight forward and the house was just as described. The house is very cute and located in a lovely quiet spot with a glimpse of the ocean. Our kids loved roasting marshmallows on the amazing fire pit. We would highly recommend Heather, Pacific Grove and her cute house for families or couples. 

"
11305882,168620218,2017-07-09,90348301,Willow,"This home was perfect for a sister getaway weekend in Monterey Bay. We walked along the ocean trail to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was a gorgeous 30 minute stroll. We roasted marshmallows in the fire pit, and basically spent a quiet weekend catching up. Thanks Heather.  "
11305882,169512089,2017-07-12,90418939,Daisy,"Heather’s place is amazing. Very comfortable bed, minutes away from the ocean and nicely decorated. The aquarium passes is a plus with the fire pit in the back yard is another!"
11305882,171143510,2017-07-16,131842933,Amy,"Heather is an amazing host and very easy to reach and communicate with.  We were on a mother/daughter weekend away. Upon our arrival, we were welcomed with a welcoming sign and a bottle of wine. Each bed had Ghirardelli chocolates on the pillows, which was a great treat for us gals. The home is perfect. Great location, very inviting and beautifully decorated. She really gos the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable. The place is immaculate, warm and cozy. Heather has thought of everything you may need while on vacation.  She basically supplies you with everything you may have forgotten to pack in your bags. 

We took advantage of the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes she privides and had a wonderful time.  Her choice in games she provides are awesome! We shared so many laughs playing them, when we weren't out back by the fire place roasting marsh mellows in the evenings. 

I would highly recommend her home, you wont be disappiinted. We will definitely be back again. "
11305882,172723156,2017-07-21,40401118,Suzan,Lovely neighborhood . Cozy house.  Aquarium passes are spot on. Walk to everything.  Quiet.  Thank you Heather for sharing such a lovely home.
11305882,176408379,2017-07-30,19752465,Axelle,"Heather was a wonderful host, making us feel welcome in her home, and giving us clear instructions.  We had a fabulous time and would definitely go back!"
11305882,179517464,2017-08-07,127046806,Andrew,Beautiful house with great location for walks into Monterey. Heather was a great host and we will definitely be back in the future. 
11305882,182064916,2017-08-13,73893873,Dipesh,"This place is simply beautiful, has view of the ocean, great location and my family had awesome time. Kids enjoyed playing in front and back yard. Decor is simple but very elegant and everything was appropriate and nicely done. Location is very near (5 min car drive) to Pacific grove downtown, butterfly grove, Monterey bay aquarium, beach, 17 mile drive. We tried restaurants around Pacific grove downtown and Peppers Mexican was great. Its a very quite neighborhood and it was relaxing to spend evenings after doing various activities. Big Sur is not too far from here and its about 30-40 min drive depending upon where you are going. We went to Pfeiffer state park which was fantastic and kids loved playing around the river. I would highly recommend this place and will surely visit again."
11305882,190712385,2017-09-04,81728135,Monika,"Our experience in Heather's beautiful cottage has been one of the best we've had.  Her home is perfectly located, pristine clean, tastefully decorated confortable, cozy and doesn't lack absolutely anything to make it the perfect family vacation in the Monterrey Bay.  Heather was very responsive and even though we didn't meet her in person we felt her warmth and care - undoubtedly a wonderful host.  We'll definitely be back,  Thanks, Heather!"
11305882,192649367,2017-09-10,139452328,Ron,House is clean but exterior of house doesn't look as nice as pictures.
11305882,194925503,2017-09-17,65815143,Shannon,"Heather's hospitality and responsiveness exceeded our expectations. The cottage was so charming and comfortable, not to mention perfectly located. Deer walked down the street in front of us as we made our way to the path along the ocean. Within 20 minutes we were in downtown Monterey. The firepit was fabulous, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. The only thing missing was a garbage disposal and dishwasher. We ate out most of the time, but if you're planning do to a lot of cooking and meal prep, clean up is a little challenging. But these minor inconveniences didn't impact our fabulous stay overall, and we would definitely rent this property again if we go back to the area!"
11305882,196614497,2017-09-23,45308355,Rich,"Heathers place is beautifully located in a quiet residential area with amazing views of the sea and a great back garden with huge fire pit for the evenings. Plus theres the added bonus of passes to the aquarium ($200 value!) which you should definitely go to. It's spectacular, especially at feeding time!

A 25 minute (and stunning walk) along the waterfront to the town was an absolute delight, especially watching the whales and sea otters constantly popping up!

The area is also a great base for exploring the surrounding areas of Carmel, Pebble Beach and Big Sur, making it a great spot for us.

Heather was also super helpful in recommending places to go, things to do and see, making the few days we stayed there even better. 

Highly recommend it!"
11305882,197760070,2017-09-26,119338963,Lynette,"A great house! The location is ideal for whatever you want to do whether it's in Monterey, going to Big Sur, etc. Heather was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine for our anniversary! It was the perfect home for us. It was clean, well taken care of and had a great place for sitting in the backyard. Highly recommend!"
11305882,214378348,2017-11-25,16872915,Vonnie,Loved this place! Perfect for small family trip. Great location.  House had everything we needed and was really cute.
11305882,223759547,2018-01-01,17919287,Stephen,"Heather's place was so beautiful, clean, and close to the water. The firepit was lovely and overall just had such charm to it. It was a bit chilly inside at first as the heat had been off, but Heather checked in on us and let us know about the space heater she had recently gotten. The 4 of us loved spending New Year's Eve at this charming cottage."
11305882,240462683,2018-03-04,5302310,Liam,"Our stay at Heather's place was very enjoyable. The cottage is a delightful place to stay that Heather has made incredibly welcoming - the welcome chocolates and wine were an amazing touch.

The location is amazing - we saw a lot of whales and deer through the front windows. We hope to come back again."
11478979,82211252,2016-06-26,61332793,Christine,"We loved everything about this upscale, elegant, and idyllic villa.  We were greeted with a lovely spread of food and beverages (wine, sparkling lemonade, cheese and crackers, grapes and fruit basket, nuts, and chocolates), and we were delighted with the discovery of trays with flowers on the beautiful beds in the bedrooms.  From the fully stocked kitchen, to the open patio with bbq and dining table, to cozy bath robes, to towel warmer, to all natural shower products, we experienced the relaxation of a superb and posh house.  Our hostess was available by text anytime we had a question and she was a terrific resource for finding local treasures. We booked this house because we wanted a quiet tastefully decorated respite that enabled walking to shops and restaurants as well as the beach.  We look forward to staying again when we travel to Pacific Grove!"
11478979,83972183,2016-07-05,11588548,Abby,"Alisa was pretty much the perfect host. When we arrived later than expected, the place was absolutely immaculate. She had set out wine, cheese, fruit, etc. to make us feel welcome and even made a dinner reservation for us when our plans changed unexpectedly. 

The decor of Villa Luz is perfectly reflective of the Central Coast area, with Spanish influences (beautiful tile, colorful linens, etc.). Everything seemed clean, new and spotless -- and the beds were also super comfortable! All soaps, etc. were environmentally friendly and free of chemicals, which was much appreciated. I wish we had had the opportunity to use the picnic set Alisa set out for us (and bikes), but we were there on a cold day and didn't bring enough clothes! 

We had a wonderfully cozy and romantic weekend as husband and wife and sat by the fire drinking the wine Alisa made sure we were stocked with. Loved the speaker we could plug into also! The place is within walking distance of downtown PG and a short 10-15 minute Uber to all that Carmel has to offer -- 45 minutes to a fun-filled day of hiking in Big Sur. 

It was a truly incredible weekend -- this is one of the best Airbnbs we've ever stayed in and we will definitely be back to the area to visit the Carmel area and Villa Luz!"
11478979,86724646,2016-07-17,80573907,Matt,"Incredible place to stay in Pacific Grove/Monterey. Spacious and wonderfully decorated, and the host made the stay special with wine and cheese at arrival and everything you'd expect from a fine resort. Miss it already!"
11478979,87341073,2016-07-19,65167988,Kyle,It was a fantastic stay from start to finish. Alisa was great on communication throughout the experience. All the little details were considered to make the stay as easy as possible. I'll never go back to staying in hotels!!
11478979,94915325,2016-08-17,29712812,Mick,"A truly wonderful place. 

Our family of five with three young kids of 6, 4 and 2 had three lovely nights at Alisa's Villa and moved it. A great place with everything you need - nice kitchen, comfy beds, good shower, relaxing lounges. Plus lots of extras like chess board, wine and cheese on arrival. 

The house is a short walk to coffee, restaurants and shops. It's also a short drive to all the attractions. 

Dennis the Menace park was so so so good for kids. Huge and lots of fun. 

Alisa was wonderful and went way above and beyond the call of duty especially with our kids. 

Thanks"
11478979,96466183,2016-08-22,63289519,Joe,This was my first time using AIRBNB and I must say if the rest are like this I will never use a hotel again.  Alisa was a gracious host and made you feel welcome and at home.  The house is only two blocks from a very nice small town downtown with excellent restaurants and just a wonderful feel.   I only say that you will not be disappointed.   This is a gem and so is she. 
11478979,100370403,2016-09-09,33871143,Kate,Alisa so responsive to any requests and helpful from day 1 before we arrived and after.
11478979,101010441,2016-09-11,84470724,Karen,"This 2-bedroom townhouse in central Pacific Grove was perfect for us! 
So cozy and comfortable for me, my husband and our two daughters. And Alisa made it special with wine, cheese, chocolate, crackers and fresh flowers. Other amenities we appreciated: gas fireplace, garage parking, Monterey Bay Aquarium tickets, bicycles, Netflix, WIFI and board games.

Look forward to staying here again. :)"
11478979,103469942,2016-09-22,95426154,Miriam,"Villa Luz was the perfect place for our family reunion. We all loved it. I was overwhelmed with how beautifully the apartment was decorated, how much care had been put into providing little extras like a bottle of wine, cheese, grapes and crackers to greet us. The free passes for the aquarium saved us 100$ and truthfully it was very hard to leave this wonderful place. This was the best vacation spot ever!"
11478979,105169154,2016-09-30,94976594,Kathleen M,"Pleasant condo, decorated very nicely. Two bedrooms only one bath (with jacuzzi tub) and an additional sink in the second bedroom.  Convenient location, easy walking to restaurants and beach.  Enjoyable vacation get away."
11478979,106172170,2016-10-04,86210603,Ruth,"This was our first airbnb experience and I am afraid we will be spoiled for any others. The attention to detail and welcoming touches was amazing , from fresh flowers to champagne and cheese and fruit chilled to help celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. Location was great , walking distance to great food and central for visiting Monterey , Carmel . I cannot say enough about this place , the pictures online only give you a glimpse of the loveliness of Villa Luz ."
11478979,109154184,2016-10-19,31112420,Lisa,"We can't recommend this place highly enough! Alisa accommodated a very late check in and, upon our arrival, there was wine, cheese, and fresh fruit waiting. She had also gone out of her way to provide a pack n play, high chair, and apple juice for our toddler. Everything was immaculate and clean. Great location in Pacific Grove - walkable to many shops and restaurants. We will definitely stay here again the next time we're in the area."
11478979,111794127,2016-11-01,40288166,Cathleen,We travel extensively and we both felt this was the best place we have stayed at.  Close to everything and nice size but the attention to detail was out standing.  It really felt like a well cared for home.  Alisa was very friendly and helpful.
11478979,112903867,2016-11-08,90938417,Debra,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I couldn't have asked for a better one. It was even better than the photos, which I didn't think was possible. The apartment is absolutely beautiful and not a single detail was overlooked. Bicycles are available to use during your stay. Items such as chairs, mats and blankets are provided to use for a beach outing. The kitchen was fully stocked with plenty of dishes, pots and pans, small appliances, utensils, etc. The bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels of all sizes, tissues, q-tips, lotions and soaps. I immediately felt at home and loved having my morning coffee on one of the balconies everyday. Bed was so comfy. The apartment décor looks like the pages of a home (Website hidden by Airbnb) so lovely. There was also garage parking which I loved.  It was within walking distance to downtown which has some restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and a movie theater. Also a close walk to the ocean.  I hope I can go back again soon. This place provided the therapy I so needed.  "
11478979,113781483,2016-11-13,1111048,Laura,"Wow! This was hands down the best airbnb experience I've ever had. The villa was absolutely perfect for our stay for the half marathon. It is in a great location, the kitchen was well stocked for cooking, and we were walking distance cute cafes and restaurants and beautiful coastal trails. The beds were amazingly comfortable, and I loved sitting and drinking wine by the fireplace at night! 

I highly recommend staying here for a relaxing weekend away or friends getaway! "
11478979,114474029,2016-11-18,40915644,Cindy&Travis,"Our stay at the Villa was wonderful! The place is beautiful and offers anything that you could ever need on a vacation. My family took advantage of the two aquarium passes that were included in the stay. During our stay we visited downtown Monterey, Cannery Row, Lover's Point, and even drove up to Big Basin to do some hiking in the redwoods. Alisa was very sweet and made sure that everything went smoothly. She was even very understanding when we accidentally dropped a glass in the dishwasher. We will definitely be back to stay another weekend :)

11478979,115317786,2016-11-23,97983057,Aparna,"The photos don't do justice to Alisa's place. It is in an amazing location, so close to everything yet tucked away from the bustle. From the moment we booked, Alisa was always in contact and patiently answered all my questions and she always got back to me right away. 

She had a bottle of wine and a cheese plate waiting for us. The basket of fruits was a nice touch! My kids got to unwind with Netflix in the evening in the cozy living room by the fireplace. 

Thank you Alisa for sharing your wonderful home with us!"

Great open kitchen where we cooked breakfast a couple of mornings and ate some of the fruit Alisa had thoughtfully left for us. The gas fireplace was nice to sit by and read or watch the many viewing options on TV. We walked just 2 blocks into the charming town of Pacific Grove to a bookstore/ coffeehouse that had the best Chai tea latte. Many fun stores and restaurants right by the villa. Alisa was so accommodating and helped us sort out some things we needed and made sure we had everything we needed and more. We are coming back!"
11478979,126405111,2017-01-11,38605399,Michelle,"Excellent stay. Possibility the best airbnb place we have stayed in. The beds were very comfortable and we appreciated the natural soap, shampoo and conditioner. Also really enjoyed relaxing on the couch with the wine, cheese, and other goodies. Very quiet (excellent for light sleepers) and private. The host has thought of everything. Better than staying in a 5 star hotel!"
11478979,131584650,2017-02-12,63647,Matt,"Villa Luz is one of the most charming places we have ever stayed. All the small things like wine and cheese, slippers and robes, music playing and decorative lights upon arriving really made it such a welcoming pleasant experience.  Great location and easy to get around to all kinds of activities! The Monterey aquarium passes were an added bonus and was well worth the visit! We would highly recommend staying here and look forward to coming back again!

She welcomed us with wine, cheese and fruit platter, which was so nice after our long flight.  The Villa was so beautiful and clean and had everything we could need.  We would definitely stay there again in the future and it is close to Lover's Point, Big Sur, Carmel By The Sea, Pebble Beach, 17-Mile Drive and Cannery Row.  We absolutely loved California and would stay at Villa Luz again!"

11478979,154439029,2017-05-24,78352158,Donna,"Villa Luz is the BEST, as is the beautiful town of Pacific Grove.  If you are coming to visit the Monterey Peninsula, Villa Luz is the place to stay!  It is beautiful, well cared for, CLEAN, and walkable to all the PG shops, restaurants, and the gorgeous walkway along the water.  Plus, it is only a short drive to Monterey, Pebble Beach, and Point Lobos State Reserve.  Alisa was the perfect host for the week.  She answered texts, calls, email promptly and completely, and made us feel welcome at Villa Luz by leaving wine, cheese, fruit, crackers, and other goodies for us!  Villa Luz has two bedrooms and one bath, with an extra sink/mirrow/shelving in one of the bedrooms.  Our daughter and son-in-law were supposed to stay with us only one night, then they were moving into a Pebble Beach Airbnb with another couple.  Their first night was with us, then they moved to the other house.  The next day they were back with us for the rest of the week because Villa Luz was s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) much nicer than the PB house!  "
11478979,156110356,2017-05-29,59360629,Juan,"Stayed here for the CaliRoots festival – very nice and cozy spot with a Spanish flare (has Saltillo tile). It’s conveniently located between Pacific Grove and Monterey. There is a parking garage that fits 2 cars and the house has its own separate entrance when you go up the spiral stairs from the outside.

The owner left a nice bottle of Merlot with grapes and cheese, aquarium tickets, and healthy goodies to snack on  – thank you! Green cleaning products, as well as natural soaps and shampoo are provided. Both bedrooms have comfortable bedding with plenty of closet space and natural light. One bedroom has a balcony and the other bedroom has an additional sink. Additionally, there was a nice breakfast tray on each bed with some home décor and books (one by Mark Twain).

Kitchen is nice and spacious, equipped with a dish washer and a trash can that separates trash from recyclables. Great open layout with a nice view of the living room and fireplace from the kitchen. Our favorite bit was the ‘welcome’ board with our names near the entrance! All in all, we had a great experience and would definitely stay here again."
11478979,182519455,2017-08-14,2069622,Brian,Villa Luz is a fantastic property in the heart of Pacific Grove and central to anything you would want to do on the Monterey peninsula. Alisa is a great host who takes care in the small details to make your stay feel special. Highly recommended!!

It is located just blocks away from downtown Pacific Grove; so, everything is within walking distance (shops, cafes, restaurants, bookstore, etc.). But staying in was fine as well since the villa has all the comforts of home.  Also, the aquarium passes came in handy since my boys love the aquarium. We’re all ooking forward to visiting again!"

11478979,220746320,2017-12-23,9895093,Daniela,Villa Luz is in a great location near all the things you would want to do and see in Pacific Grove. We were a group or 3 adults and one 20 month old and we were very comfortable here. We loved the deep soaking tub and well appointed kitchen.

11478979,252941854,2018-04-12,57340024,Jennifer,This Villa is absolutely beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice. It’s walking distance from many cute little eateries and shops as well as lovers point beach. Very family friendly. Only a short drive to the aquarium and Cannery Row.  Alisa was wonderful and responded promptly to questions.

11533508,75538467,2016-05-22,53732420,Matthew,"I had a great time at Terre's place in Pacific Grove.  It was clean, tidy and close to the ocean.  Check in and out was simple.  I'd easily stay here again if in the area."
11533508,76173780,2016-05-25,13046030,Sherly,"My significant other and I just got married this past Friday evening and we booked Sunday-Wednesday in Pacific Grove at Terre's home as a small get-away to relax after months of planning our wedding. Terre's home is two stories; master bedroom downstairs and kitchen, dining room, and living room upstairs. The upstairs has a nice view of the water and while the direct street view had a good amount of construction due to PG&E, Terre was sweet enough to inform us of any possible disruptions well ahead of time. She even left us a bottle of wine with a card as an apology for the disruption. Luckily, we didn't have any issues. The home was pristine and had plenty of bedding and towels and even had a garage with direct access into the house. The kitchen did lack sugar for tea/coffee found in the kitchen but it wasn't a big deal to us.  A small hiccup with Wifi connecting to my cell phone but after Terre suggested I restart my device, everything worked just fine. The only suggestions for improvements my husband and I could think of would be to include sofa beds instead of regular couches upstairs for additional people for future reservations. The quaint neighborhood and proximity to restaurants and water access was perfect for us. We'd love to visit again in the future. "
11533508,77267148,2016-05-31,66135123,CandR,"Fantastic experience here! Lovely little home apartment with convenience around just about every corner. We had a fantastic weekend enjoying everything Monterey, Carmel, and Pacific Grove had to offer from this fantastic location. Terre was gracious and easy to get a hold of when we had any questions about the area and ended up extending our stay we were so relaxed.

Thank you!"
11533508,78604335,2016-06-07,19752141,Pheroze,"What a wonderful place!
I spent 8 days at Sans Souci to get work done as a writer.
The house is clean, on a quiet block, quick walking distance to town, and right in front of the ocean! Within a week I saw a whale breaching, seals swimming, and a school of dolphins hopping around right from the upstairs window.

I didn't have a car - and I didn't need one. The location is really central to everything you could possibly want: Ocean, beach, kayaking, walking/biking paths, restaurants, coffee shops, grocery store, farmer's market.

If you're staying in, the kitchen is well-stocked to prepare meals, there's a coffee maker and TV with full cable access and WiFi. Oh, and that view!

Terre is extremely communicative and quick to return messages. The check-in/out process was simple. The house was spotless and freshly cleaned when I arrived, and Terre had thoughtfully provided a gift basket with snacks and coffee when I got in.

It's a great place for a solo traveler or couple to unwind, relax, enjoy nature, fins some peace, and get some work done (if you want to).

I'll be back. And I can't wait."
11533508,79674034,2016-06-13,70150790,Sara,"The house was amazing! Terre was super-apologetic about some construction that was happening on the street, but it didn't end up being any trouble at all. Everything we could want was there - skillets, pots & pans, utensils for cooking, bowls, Wi Fi, binoculars for checking out the sea life, cushy large towls - everything. And we were right in the middle of Lover's Point - spectacular."
11533508,81349483,2016-06-22,331926,Beryl,"We had a great time at Terre's house.  It was totally clean throughout and very comfortable. There was everything we needed, there where plenty of cups, bowls, plates pans so you can cook a full meal if required. Good quality new towels and bedding all helped make us feel at home. Big bright lounge with full width window with sea views only partially obstructed by rooftops.  We sat in the window each morning for breakfast,  it was difficult  to pull ourselves away. Everything is lovelly. It is literally  2 minutes walk to the sea front. No problem parking right outside. Would definitely stay again. Great comuncation with Terre via email. She had left us a lovely bottle of wine, thankyou Terre. Nice drinks at the beach house at lovers point, food looked good too."
11533508,81874389,2016-06-25,37611672,Ghordan,"Terre's home was beautiful and the views of the ocean in the morning were absolutely breathtaking. This was the most clean home I've ever stayed in with Airbnb and Terre was so helpful throughout the trip. There are plenty of places within walking distance: the ocean, restaurants, Cannery road, etc. Can't wait to stay here again soon!"
11533508,83347126,2016-07-02,4547244,Jon,Great place to stay.  Very clean and well maintained and definitely would stay again.  We had a great time whale watching from the living room until we headed out everyday.  
11533508,84115127,2016-07-05,71491852,Greg,Perfect alternative to overpriced Monterey hotels.
11533508,85631347,2016-07-12,1304871,Ben,"Great location, comfy home.  We loved staying so close to Lover's Point, and felt that Terre had a well-appointed home for us.  We were especially glad for the big windows and a pair of binoculars upstairs. We saw a few humpback whales out the window one morning."
11533508,86334931,2016-07-16,19710360,Alex,"a great little spot, right near the ocean and next to lovers point. really enjoyed the walk to the aquarium too. the house was cozy and lovely and had everything we needed for a 3 day stay breaking up our trip down the coast. would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone! "
11533508,88539741,2016-07-24,27250109,Kai,"Terre's place is in the most beautiful location. The view from the living rooms window over the bay is nothing short of spectacular. The house is very well appointed and beautifully decorated. We felt very welcome and looked after. The location could not be more convenient and yet the tranquility allowed us to have the most relaxing holiday with easy access to one of the most beautiful parts of the world.
Thank you, Terre."
11533508,89766311,2016-07-30,7542229,Sara Louise,We had a really nice three day stay in Terre's home. It was the perfect place for relaxing with a beautiful view of the sea and close to everything you need for getting completely down in tempo. We would definitely come back if we would ever find ourself in the area!
11533508,91062253,2016-08-03,33678479,Ryan,"We loved the convenient location - it's close to restaurants and has a great view of the ocean. The accommodations were comfortable, clean and Terre was a very conscientious host and went out of her way to make sure we were not inconvenienced in any way. The bathroom was very nicely updated."
11533508,92542137,2016-08-09,2047344,Donna,"An amazing location - in a town that itself is in an amazing location.  From this location, you can walk the trail away from the crowds, or in just a few minutes, you can walk to the aquarium, whale-watching, and anything else ""touristy"" you want to do!   And, you will be amazed when you climb the stairs the first time and see your view."
11533508,94083269,2016-08-14,69048312,Nina,Communications and arrangements were smooth and friendly
11533508,97830360,2016-08-28,69277492,Sarah,"Terre's home is beautiful!! It's updated and nicely decorated, the shower was fantastic, and the upstairs living room is full of Windows that overlook the beach and another row of cute houses. The view was absolutely amazing, and they even provided binoculars to look out over the coast. The neighborhood is really quiet, except for the sound of the waves on the beach, which is a short walk away. 

This place is seriously next to EVERYTHING. You can walk to lovers point beach, cannery row and the aquarium, not to mention a bunch of great restaurants. You're also a short drive away from a bunch of small beaches and tide pools, as well as Carmel and Asilomar beaches. We are seriously considering moving to this area after staying in Terre's amazing place!"
11533508,99788288,2016-09-05,40062606,Olga,Terre helped the trip feel like i was at home. stress free. the views of the water amazing. if you like to run you can run the trails along the water. i did that ever morning. I would stay there again. 
11533508,101038132,2016-09-11,55548399,Cheryl,"Great value for the location.  Everything as pictured and the bathroom is especially nice.  It is hard to pull yourself away from the upper level view.  We ate out but the kitchen is well provided for cooks.

Terre and the manager on site were terrific with a quick response to all questions.  Very easy in and out of the property.  There is little expected from the renter other than to be a considerate individual (others have asked that we start laundry etc.)

Be aware that there are stairs to the living/dining area.  Bedroom and bathroom are on the ground level.

We would definitely recommend the property."
11533508,103031670,2016-09-20,6585993,Staci,Terre's place is superb--- perfect for a little getaway. Location cannot be beat. 
11533508,103657020,2016-09-23,43224728,Erin Leigh,"We had a great stay in Pacific Grove and found Terre's place to be charming. It had a great location, which enabled us to walk to all the restaurants and the beach. Would definitely recommend to friends and family! "
11533508,105208884,2016-09-30,66690780,Lorraine,"The Sans Souci was our home away from home. We were welcomed to a cozy beach cottage, complete with a lovely bottle of wine, very welcoming after a long day's drive. Your kitchen is well stocked allowing us to cook our breakfasts and dinners, just like home. From your windows, we were able to watch seiners, kayakers, pelicans, seagulls, bull kelp. Binoculars were perfect. Parking in the garage was an added bonus and the location is fabulous! We walked to the Beach House for dinner, walked along the beach path around Lover's Pt and watched the fog roll in. Thank you for a memorable stay. One suggestion: a fan for those warm days."
11533508,106886122,2016-10-08,2927135,Bryan,"Had a great time at Terre's house. It was the perfect location, just one row of houses from the beautiful coastline, with great views from the upstairs bay windows. Urbano was very helpful and accommodating through the check-in process. "
11533508,108180153,2016-10-15,15493151,Lisa,"
Our stay at terre's home was great. It was in a great location and is a well cared for home. The view is what makes the place the best. "
11533508,109012784,2016-10-18,50110945,Jacqueline,"We loved staying here and in Pacific Grove. House was great, well appointed, comfortable bed , lovely view and lots of helpful brochures around on what to do and see. Highly recommend staying here."
11533508,110036966,2016-10-23,34324970,Jeff,Beautiful small house just steps from the scenic views of Lover's Point in Pacific Grove. We had a wonderful weekend getaway and absolutely loved the house!
11533508,110817560,2016-10-28,4553616,Maribeth,"Very accommodating. Terre's place is comfortable, clean and centrally located. we enjoyed our stay there."
11533508,111950829,2016-11-02,57002092,Elizabeth,"Terre's home was wonderful, just perfect for those who like to look out at the ocean, walk along the beach paths, wander into town, and just plain loll around.  The upstairs housed all the main living spaces, so you can spend your time enjoying the view.  Downstairs is the bedroom and bath which are in the back of the property, so very quiet at night. We got to use the washer and dryer and the garage was available for parking.  When there was a possibility of some road construction during our stay, Terre offered some alternatives.  Luckily, no work was done while we were there, so no disruptions in our lovely stay. Good TV reception and speedy wifi available."
11533508,113788522,2016-11-13,99157843,Wade,This was the perfect place for the two of us for a little weekend getaway.  A short drive to Carmel or downtown Monterey and just a few steps away from the water.   House was clean and had everything we needed. 
11533508,115129391,2016-11-21,28915533,Thomas,We did not meet her but everything was perfect. The first morning coffee included a view on whales passing.
11533508,115725107,2016-11-26,76872291,Leah,"Terre's place was really nice, we stayed there over the Thanksgiving week, and it was wonderful! Love the view and the neighborhood. Terre was also very great, we asked for an early check in, and she had the place ready at noon. Love the place and we will be back again. "
11533508,116454243,2016-11-30,39757418,Arianne,Me and my husband really enjoyed our stay here.  The location was perfect and we loved waking up to the sun and ocean right outside our window.  Terre was incredibly responsive to our questions and emails and this place has all the amenities you would need for a pleasant and peaceful stay.  We will definitely try coming back here!
11533508,117244660,2016-12-05,99540452,Leann,"Staying at Terre's place was wonderful.  The area was absolutely beautiful and the home was perfectly located.  I traveled alone this time, and I felt very safe and comfortable in the area and Terre's home.
"
11533508,120879806,2016-12-12,50333028,Brian,"The property was in the perfect spot for my wife and I to take an amazing walk each morning. My wife was 7 months pregnant when we stayed at Terre's place.. The location and comfortable feel left us planning our next trip to head back to PG and MB every year.
"
11533508,130113861,2017-02-04,1596617,Donna,"Terre's place is in the perfect spot for nature lovers; close to the most scenic, wildlife inhabited beach I've found in California, a lovely view out the living room windows of the sea, yet one block back for enhanced privacy.  In addition to the photos properly representing the space, what you can't see in those photos is how expertly the home is stocked with every kitchen device/necessity in the most beautifully organized manner, and how comfy the bed and high end linens/blankets were, and the gorgeous bathroom was one of the nicest I've seen in Airbnbs.  In addition, Terre is a very prompt and honest communicator.  Strongly recommended!"
11533508,131781893,2017-02-13,97130585,Paulette,"We were visiting for the Pebble Beach Golf tournament and didn't do any cooking. We were only there early in the morning and later in the day. The house is small but plenty big enough for everything we needed. The downstairs bedroom was large enough and the bed was comfortable. The shower is especially attractive. Windows span the upstairs kitchen and living room, and the ocean view is fantastic. We frequently saw whales in the distance blowing. The location is one street over from the coast and a short walk. Pacific Grove restaurants are really good and just a few minute drive. The place is very tastefully decorated! We were glad we picked this place to stay!!"
11533508,133304402,2017-02-21,105521215,Jennifer,"A wonderful place, right next to the ocean with great view and close to everything. Communication was great, check in and out very easy - had everything we needed and we will definitely stay again!"
11533508,134729220,2017-02-28,15240572,Jacqueline,My husband and I were looking for a quiet get away along the coast and Terre's place was just the ticket.  You really can't beat the view from the upstairs living room and having off street parking was a pleasant surprise.
11533508,136984309,2017-03-12,15128985,Sally,"Clean, bright and cheerful place.  Terre and her caretaker Urbano were quick to communicate and helpful with our needs."
11533508,141776318,2017-04-04,2091068,James,Beautiful beach house one block from the ocean. Lovely views and the host and her property manager are excellent
11533508,143836600,2017-04-13,118653617,Ben,"A cozy quaint house that overlooks a nice view of the bay with easy walking distances to dining, Monterey Cannery Row and easy access to roads to get around the peninsula.
"
11533508,145519604,2017-04-18,5099720,Ellen,"Just perfect!!! 
We were lucky to be able to book Terre's place for 5 nights in mid April - and we have to say that this is pretty much the perfect spot for a couple to explore the Monterey Peninsula! The apartment itself is cozy and well appointed. Thoughtful touches abound - the bathroom is quite lovely   the kitchen is fully equipped and it is spotlessly clean. Urbano was terrific with meeting us and making sure we were settled in. The location is on a quiet street with good views of the ocean. We heard nothing but the seagulls, wind and waves! Just a short walk across the street and you are on the seaside walking trail - you can take a right and in just over a mile be at the Monterey Aquarium (highly recommend!) or head into downtown PG to meander the lovely residential areas, restaurants and shops. We luckily discovered Fifi's, a beloved local French restaurant with a terrific menu. Also don't miss the beautifully natural Asilomar Beach, right nearby. We were glad to be here during pupping season - a real treat to watch the mother seals and their little ones on the local beaches. We also visited Carmel and Point Lobos - both a short drive away and well worth the visit for hiking, beaching and terrific restaurants and galleries. Great trip - thank you again Terre!  
Ellen and Peter"
11533508,147593553,2017-04-27,98667491,Leon,"Wonderful location right near the ocean, has everything you will need during your stay, check-in was handled easily with a call to Urbano who was very friendly.  If you are looking for a place to stay in a quiet neighborhood I would highly recommend Terre's place."
11533508,150269621,2017-05-07,17475903,Evan,Lovely house with great ocean views. Very comfortable and a great location. Highly recommend. 
11533508,151446656,2017-05-12,70521081,Hilde,Dit huisje is een echte aanrader! heel netjes en vrij luxueus (Website hidden by Airbnb) betaalt hier een zeer eerlijke prijs voor wat je wordt aangeboden in vergelijking met de hotels en B&B in de buurt!
11533508,152274899,2017-05-15,74791228,Heather,It was a great place for staying at Monterey. We enjoyed our visit. 
11533508,153088425,2017-05-19,28511169,Jen,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Terre’s house for four nights in early May (60s/perfectly sunny and blue); it was perfect for the two of us. There are a few key things I must have when travelling and Terre’s house did not disappoint.  (1) Cleanliness. The house was SPOTLESS. I cannot say enough about this. (2) Sleep. The bed was very comfortable (it is a bit firm, which I prefer), tons of pillows in various flavors, and soft, plush-made-me-not-want-to-get-out-of-bed linens. I was a happy sleeper. (3) Coffee (maker). I always wonder about this one, when the detail section does not mention it. So - if you are wondering, there is a real coffee maker. Other perks – the ocean view from upstairs is amazing and a sight to see when walking up the stairs in the morning.  Towards coffee. The bathroom/shower is exquisite and the towels are soft (happy bather). There is a lovely walking path that will lead you past Lover’s Point towards a yummy restaurant (the name escapes me – you can’t miss it). We did not eat in much, usually just breakfast. As I mentioned, there is a coffee maker. And a toaster. J And, for those who are cooking, the kitchen appears very well appointed – with a bbq and cute little seating area in back. Activities in the area abound. We went to the aquarium - one of my favorite places – and on a whale watching tour (more Orcas then I have ever seen!). Finally, yet importantly . . . although we did not meet Terre or Urbano face-to-face, they were both very pleasant and communicative. Terre got back to us right away about her home – and Urbano called regarding our check-in/check-out, to make sure our stay was going well, and to ensure we had everything we needed. I recommend Terre’s house wholeheartedly and would definitely stay there again.

Recommendable for anyone visiting the Monterey  Bay area who wants to enjoy views of the bay and walks along the shore. Not recommended for anyone who has difficulty with stairs."
11533508,164240110,2017-06-26,19197759,Cor,We had a wonderful stay at the house only a few steps away from the ocean. You can walk to Cannery Row so yoy don not hsve to park your car. In the house everything you need is there.

The house was in a perfect location, a great size for 2 people and had all amenities you could possibly need (yes there are coffee filters in the drawer, you don't need to buy more!)  Terre was very quick to communicate and kept us updated on the road construction situation.  We were there over the weekend and the construction didn't inconvenience us at all.  We would definitely recommend this property and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."

Terre and Urbano were both very helpful. We loved it!"

Mornings here are extremely special if you enjoy the sounds of the sea. The place has all you would need and is perfect for 2 people. Terre and Urbano were great hosts and they were available any time I would require any help. I would recommend this place to anyone planning on travelling to this area.
11533508,196030463,2017-09-21,103878004,Adam,Great place to stay with everything we needed!
11533508,197525417,2017-09-25,77366358,Stephanie,"This little house was exceptional. It was so close to the water that we would take our morning cup of coffee and drink it on the ocean benches across the street. We saw seals, dolphins, whales and lots of different types of birds. Terre includes binoculars which makes it easy to spend hours watching the ocean.  It's walking distance from the downtown area which is where we ate brunch and dinner. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
11533508,198244175,2017-09-28,90795241,Shannon,"A wonderful jewel, I would book this spot again for a quick getaway with my lady!"
11533508,199961331,2017-10-03,70826320,Happy,"A lovely property in a great location. Stones throw from the coastal trail. Moss landing about 1 hour drive away which is great for sealions, kayaking and whale watching. Would recommend this property"
11533508,200797897,2017-10-06,6772636,Stacy,"All the positive posts are accurate. You would be nuts not to like Terri’s house.  Do keep in mind the steps. 14 to get back & forth to bathroom.  For me, even w/ knee pain the place is worth it."
11533508,202297663,2017-10-10,87803110,Ashley,Terre’s place is fantastic. Perfect size for a couple and wonderful that it had a full kitchen and living room. Beautiful views! Amazing location...central to everything we wanted to see!
11533508,203251396,2017-10-14,147282310,Scott,Great space close to lots of amenities.  Place was clean communication was great we'll probably be back.
11533508,211845589,2017-11-14,92821143,Kathy,"This apartment is lovely, very clean, bright, well equipped, and fantastic location!"
11533508,213350212,2017-11-20,139528001,Jessie,Location location location allowed us to walk everywhere! Super quite neighborhood with plenty to do.
11533508,215788724,2017-12-01,14451563,Inez,"We loved the little house very much. Please note that there are stairs leading up to the kitchen, dining area and living room and the VIEW!! All worth it!! Our Lexus RX350 just fit in the garage! There are a washer and dryer located in the garage."
11533508,218060291,2017-12-10,11996765,Brittany Joy & Alexander,"My hubbs and I had a long weekend getaway for my 30th birthday at Sans Souci and immediately felt at home in the darling seaside community that is Pacific Grove. The ocean-facing windows in this little beach cottage are the true highlight and worth waking up at sunrise for every day. Location-wise, you are one street over from the ocean, have a trail system practically outside your door that we used every day for either running alongside the ocean, or for walking to/from Monterrey and Cannery Row. We were surprised to learn of the Jingle Bell 5K having their start/finish line at Lover's Point Park, just down the street from us - needless to say, we signed up the morning of and joined in on the community event which was another highlight of our adventure. You have easy access to Hwy 1 to take a scenic drive down the coast through Big Sur (highly recommend the 17-mile drive - it's worth the $10...be sure to stop and put your toes in the sand at Pebble Beach!) and Carmel by the Sea is a darling area no more than a 15-minute drive away (if you like Mediterranean food - Dametra is a MUST!). Two of our favorite places on this trip were Bright Coffee for cappuccinos and La Mia Cucina for a homey Italian (Website hidden by Airbnb) yourself a favor and just go. Our host, Terre, was super responsive when booking and Urbano, the property manager, was incredibly hospitable, warm and helpful. We would highly recommend a stay here (even though we'd like it to stay a secret gem). :)"
11533508,229466150,2018-01-23,51106547,Janet,"The cottage is great, clean and thoughtfully furnished. It is situated very close to downtown Pacific Grove and one block from the ocean. Very nice views of the water. "
11533508,231136060,2018-01-30,37709211,Patrick,"You cannot beat the location if you want to visit the Monterey peninsula. Close to everything in Monterey (Aquarium, Cannery Row, 17 mile drive, etc). From a place to stay, it is perfect. The kitchen was really well equipped and had everything anyone could want or need in a kitchen. The home was sparkling clean and frankly looked so good we wondered if it had been remodeled right before we got there! Beautiful floors and it looked like it had just been painted. And being located in Pacific Grove is another plus. Great restaurants within a mile,as well as interesting local shops downtown. Communication was great as was check in and check out. I can't think of one thing that could have been better!! We look forward to coming back in the future."
11533508,233474742,2018-02-09,153288583,Richard,Lovely accommodations!
11533508,234467934,2018-02-12,80616666,Jim,Great value. Nice location.
11533508,236624963,2018-02-19,3105416,Yuanna,"The Sans Souci was truly incredible. I've stayed in dozens of Airbnbs all around the world and Terre's place is in my top 3! The space was beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, has a fantastic shower, and the view of the water from the second floor living room is lovely! Not to mention the amazing location - it can't be beat. It's only a few minute walk away from the gorgeous Lover's Point Beach and close by to all the hot spots in Monterey. Note that there are stairs inside the house (the bedroom & bathroom are downstairs and the living room & kitchen are upstairs), so be aware of that if you're disabled or have difficulty climbing stairs. I HIGHLY recommend Terre's place and will certainly be staying here again if I'm ever back in the area."
11533508,238769784,2018-02-26,49448825,Deborah,We loved staying here. It is wonderful
11533508,239688579,2018-03-02,22337066,Dana & Matt,"We enjoyed our stay at Terre’s place. The space was very clean - always one of the most important things to us. The view from upstairs was nice - I enjoyed watching sea lions with the provided binoculars one morning. The garage is available for parking, but we simply parked in the alley - just enough space for a midsize car. The walk to the aquarium was a bit further then we expected - about 25 minutes - but well worth it as it’s all along the coastal trail. Carmel and the scenic drive were both in close driving proximity as well. We would stay again!"
11533508,241332935,2018-03-08,15237155,Alise,The true Pacific Grove beach cottage experience! We walked everywhere and even saw otters playing from our window. Nice amenities and cozy stay. We enjoyed our three nights here.
11533508,243385364,2018-03-15,35821892,Ryan,"Clean, private, view of the ocean, no interaction with Terre or Urbano in person....perfect trip."
11533508,250970715,2018-04-06,9698156,Erin,"The Sans Souci is a very special place for anyone looking for a peaceful time on the peninsula. You've got the coast and Lover's Point practically out the front door and it was amazing to be able to watch the otters in the bay from the living room, (the binoculars provided were a huge bonus!) We were able to walk to Canary Row easily and the rest of Monterey was easily reached with a quick car ride. The house is very clean and all the necessities for daily living are in ample supply. Great host!"
11533508,252240490,2018-04-09,20439446,Kate,"We loved the location of Terre’s place - it is about a 20+ walk to the aquarium, but it’s a really nice walk (and you can always drive and find parking in Monterey); and the fact that it’s removed from the central Monterey area makes it really peaceful and a great place for quiet walks along the ocean.  The space was spacious for just the two of us, and the kitchen well outfitted with bowls and utensils if you want to cook (though plan on bringing any of the food elements like olive oil,butter etc - the fridge and shelves have no food items except a small amount of coffee and creamers). Everything was clean and there were plenty of blankets and a great heating system."
11562419,79114011,2016-06-11,69951537,Homero,"We enjoyed our stay.  The house was a rental investment house, it was comfortable, professionally cleaned and properly geared towards renters (i.e it is not used as a primary home by the owner).  The listing description was accurate.  We certainly felt the house was located in a safe neighborhood and for our purposes in a great location.  We felt it was equipped with everything we needed.  The host was responsive, and we would recommend this home.   Thanks for the stay."
11562419,83253748,2016-07-02,67352758,Mykola,My family has rented this house for 5 days. Richard has provided lots of information about the house and the area around. It is a very comfortable house. We had a great time. 
11562419,88802477,2016-07-25,5588536,Ivan,"We had a great time at Richard place, the location is great and the surrounding areas are just beautiful. We will be looking forward coming back here in the future!"
11562419,93866194,2016-08-14,68577018,Melanie,"Overall, it was a great stay with my family.  The house was a little outdated, but comfortable and clean.  The host was very thorough in providing information about the home, as well as the surrounding activities and restaurants.  If you are looking for a place that is close to Carmel and Monterey, I would absolutely recommend this Pacific Grove home."
11562419,96678899,2016-08-23,34418079,Bin,"这次旅程中最好的房子,非常安静舒适,设备齐全,虽然很晚到达房子,但十分顺利入住,非常推荐。"
11562419,98749584,2016-09-01,87174247,Wenning,good location and the house is very comfortble and clean. Landlord provided lost of (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a good experience for us!  
11562419,110358994,2016-10-25,11819448,Judith,"This is a very clean, nicely furnished and equipped house in a beautiful area.  I recommend it highly for anyone who is not environmentally sensitive - the very strongly scented laundry detergent used on the linens filled the house with perfume and meant that we had to leave a night early.  But if that is not an issue for you, then this house is perfect."
11562419,115193736,2016-11-22,2312815,Atul,Richard's place is the perfect location for a stay in the Monterey area. We had a great visit including trips to the Aquarium and the Carmel Mission. We walked to Pacific Grove (about 15 minutes) for dinner and a post-dinner stroll on the beach. The place was very comfortable and made it easy for our family to enjoy a few quiet days away. There is a Trader Joe's and Safeway very close by for getting snacks/supplies and the old Pacific Grove downtown is within 3 minutes drive or 15 minutes walk. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is 5 minutes drive away and the Carmel Mission and Carmel-by-the-Sea is a short 15 minute drive away. We would definitely look to stay here again on a future trip.
11562419,123118270,2016-12-27,32973541,Wessel,"Great location and amenities. Excellent value right in the heart of Pacific Grove, highly recommended."
11562419,129820950,2017-02-02,95666911,Ke,Almost everything is perfect except the bugs.
11562419,138433377,2017-03-19,18171966,Michael,"This is a nice house, conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood off the big streets in Pacific Grove. If you look for a convenient off-campus site while attending a meeting at Asilomar, this is the place. Host is punctual in communication and seems hands-off. Much info about the area is available. Very nice yard with covered porch to relax after a long day."
11562419,144101815,2017-04-14,63525411,Mary Jo,"My husband, grandson and I had a comfortable, quiet stay at Dick's home and enjoyed walking to the park and beach from the property.  The passes for the Aquarium were very much appreciated.  Everything we needed for our week stay was available.  Thank you Dick for the perfect place for us to land.  All the info given ahead of time came in very handy esp having a six year old on board!  
I would recommend this property and would stay here again."
11562419,146714814,2017-04-23,2035312,Simon,Very central to all the golf courses and town centre
11562419,148351723,2017-04-30,113314595,Camillia,"Renter was very good with communication and details regarding how to check in and information about the house. Location was great. The pull-out bed from the couch was a bit uncomfortable, but the 2 beds in the bedrooms were great. Showers needed to be spaced out between the guests because the warm water was used up quickly, but there were plenty of towels and even some toiletries provided for the guests. There was also a few food items available to guests in the kitchen, as well as laundry supplies. Overall, a great place at a reasonable price. "
11562419,161856350,2017-06-18,127908286,Lauren,"This is the perfect spot to call ""home base"" while exploring Monterey and the surrounding areas. My family and I had a a fabulous time. "
11562419,164326663,2017-06-27,72944066,Victoria,Great staying at your house!! Lots of information provided. A comfortable and cosy house near the center.
11562419,164825284,2017-06-29,129184197,Patricia,The house was very comfortable and pleasant.  The owner has been very thoughtful in setting things up.  
11562419,168478250,2017-07-09,37549761,Mary Kay,Monterey and Carmel are wonderful and this home was a good central location for a family.
11562419,172095614,2017-07-19,128870871,Kashyap,"Stay here. The location is close enough to everything important yet also far away to enjoy the peace and quiet of the nearby part/forest. The decor is a bit dated, but felt homey. 

Were it not for a late check in due to the janitorial staff cleaning later then expected I would have rated 5."
11562419,175389634,2017-07-28,36278225,Justine,"Perfect location for everything. Easy distance from Big Sur, Point Lobos & all that Monterey has to offer. Love the rural setting. Deer outside in the parkland. Very comfortable."
11562419,176407680,2017-07-30,138542204,Stacey,Great location.  Walkable to ocean & Monterey.  Comfortable home.
11562419,177145494,2017-08-01,142927855,Dave,Richard's place in Pacific Grove was a great choice as home base for our Monterey adventure. This was the first Airbnb experience for my family of four. Any first-timer trepidations were instantly washed away when we walked through the door. The house was clean and the space and ameneties were more than adequate. Everything we needed. Richard described perfectly the home's features and was available at a moment's notice to answer any questions. 
11562419,180533938,2017-08-10,109763220,Bénédicte,"Logement fonctionnel et agréable, très nature, nous avons croisé des biches. "
11562419,187888935,2017-08-27,70714296,Tom And Oksana,"We loved the location of the house! It's situated in a quiet residential neighborhood, right across from a wooded area (park). It is 5 minutes away from the Aquarium, Cannery Row, Safeway, Trader Joe's, and the beach. The house is older with older fixtures and cabinets but is very clean and light! We had everything we needed (Keurig, hot shower, plenty of towels). The thermostat worked great! A great bonus was two passes to the Aquarium, which saved us $100. The only thing I would change were the beds (uncomfortable), however, a mattress topper for the beds and the pullout couch would be an easy fix! We are grateful to the hosts for their hospitality."
11562419,192633885,2017-09-10,148548480,Naicee,"Everything was as described by Richard. It was a perfect place for my husband, 3 little girls and I. It was easy to get to and near all the places we wanted to go to. We were able to go back and forth with ease and eat our meals at the house and relax for a bit before the next outing. Our girls loved the house and were pretty surprised and happy when they saw deers from the front porch. One of my 4 year olds loved sitting in the rocking chair and just listed to classical music. Not even sure how she found the channel. We had a wonderful stay. We highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet place but close enough to different places to visit. We hope to return another time."
11562419,197187420,2017-09-24,113599067,Lucy,We were favorably impressed with how quiet the neighborhood is .
11562419,221489121,2017-12-26,20292048,Tao,Richard is the greatest host! He sent us all the tips about the house and surroundings including the touching story of baby beer born in the back yard which my little girl felt so proud of it! We all love the story and the house! Mostly we love the warmest heart of the host - Richard! Wish you all the best! I definitely recommend his house to everyone to visit the beautiful town!
11562419,222430373,2017-12-29,70570041,Donna,"The location was perfect, Richard gives great information and accurate too.  He really takes care of the hospitality in the home as well.
We would definitely stay here again."
11562419,226256696,2018-01-09,394968,Theadora,A lovely home in a great location. Richard was very hospitable and thought of every detail.
11562419,229637199,2018-01-24,40651828,Carolyn,It was a great location. We walked to the beach twice a day. The house is clean and well supplied with necessities. I would recommend it to anyone.
11562419,242665075,2018-03-12,168922469,Kellan,Great location. Host was very friendly and easy to communicate with. I would make a return trip in the future.
11562419,245549852,2018-03-22,1518623,Nick,The house is cozy and nice.  Wi-Fi worked great.  Comfortable bed and quiet.  Great location in Pacific Grove.  Would return.
11562419,250606522,2018-04-05,70853216,Shannon,"This house is a gem. Private, quiet and very clean. Close enough to walk to beaches, quick drive to shops and downtown Pacific Grove and Monterey. I stayed with my husband, 3.5 year old and 8 month old, and will definitely check for availability if we go back to Monterey!"
11641733,73987843,2016-05-12,36232912,Minh,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11641733,77298604,2016-05-31,2527683,Cory,"Abby's home was the perfect home base for a long weekend around Monterey, Carmel and Big Sur. It's super close to the beach, Monterey Aquarium and some great restaurants. Abby left a binder recommending som restaurants, which we tried and were thrilled with. They also supplied coffee + a French press, which came in handy.

Overall, the space is very homey, clean, and had plenty of room for me and a few of my friends. There was wifi, backyard and courtyard space, and a large kitchen so we didn't have to eat out all the time. Would recommend this home highly."
11641733,82557577,2016-06-28,1374208,Anton,"We loved this house, very cute and comfy. It was a great match for our family with a 6 months old baby, there were baby books and a high chair which we really appreciated. We enjoyed the backyard that had some vegetables planted, lounge chairs and a nice little shed. The location was very convenient, too. We had some minor issues with hot water one morning, but it eventually was fine and our overall experience was very smooth and pleasant. We would definitely recommend this place!"
11641733,83959702,2016-07-04,1378661,Emily,"A lovely and cozy place to stay! The little extra room and extra bathroom in the separate shed was a nice surprise. Beds were very comfortable and directions were thorough to understand the workings of the house - how to make coffee, how to turn on the heaters, etc. A short drive to downtown Monterrey and close to a grocery store. We would definitely stay again!  The day trip recommendations were also nice. "
11641733,84655781,2016-07-08,79296417,Georgia,Really cute house in a cool location. It was a great getaway for us. Well-suited for families with kids-the house is perfect for kids to play and there were kids books for them. Well-situated between Monterey and places like Carmel/Point Lobos. Relaxing and quiet neighborhood. 
11641733,85228802,2016-07-10,6272853,Sam,"Abby was accommodating and responsive to my inquiries. We enjoyed our stay here. Didn't have many problems except for the lack of hot water in the in-law unit. There were instructions stating to let the water run for a few minutes. So we did, yet it never turn on. Also, be aware that the Monterey aquarium tickets do not come with the stay. She has it written on her description but never included with the stay. Perhaps she'll need to update her info so that it doesn't mislead future customers. Overall stay was good. Probably come back."
11641733,86471721,2016-07-16,78109066,Naveen,"Great house, close to the water front. Property was just as described. We had a great time in Pacific Grove."

11641733,100095571,2016-09-07,16787970,Farhan,"Our stay at Abby's home couldn't have been better. She answered all of our questions prior to arrival, the house was exactly if not better than the listing, she met w/us and our little one at a beach the day of our arrival for a play date, and shared her little one's toys w/ours. To top it off she lent us her guest passes to the aquarium which saved us money and allowed to go when and how often we wanted.

The apartment is in a great location (walking to grocery, 8 minutes to the beach, 10 minutes to Monterey, 15 minutes to Carmel). Couldn't have asked for a better place.

Will definitely revisit. "
11641733,102717684,2016-09-18,40529064,Korin,"We loved this place and it was perfect for our family weekend to the Monterey Jazz Festival. Abby was perfectly communicative and prepared. Overall it was a great, no hassle stay."

The house is exactly as described, very confortable, toddler & baby friendly and well equiped. Abby was very responsive and available when needed. I would definitely recommend her and will be back if I can."

11641733,140565987,2017-03-30,119207927,Philip,"We really enjoyed our stay at Abby's.  Our children loved the books, toys, and musical instruments. It was a great central location for our visit, accessible to Point Lobos, Carmel, the Aquarium.  The house was clean and well stocked with supplies.  The neighborhood was quiet.  Self check-in and checkout were simple.  Would love to visit again."

11641733,146762163,2017-04-23,18105302,Angela & Andrew,"We loved staying in this house! It was decorated so lovely and in a beautiful location. The little separated room up top was really cute and nice if you want some privacy from the rest of the group. No cable tv but we really enjoyed the HDMI cable and projector for family movies at the end of the day! The house is walking distance to a grocery store and park, and very kid friendly! "
11641733,148343946,2017-04-30,122444079,Steve,Central and charming....perfect to share some time with family....we loved it.

Perfect for a family - good space, great musical instruments and very kid friendly with lots of toddler toys and books. The location was ideal for us - right off of the sunset drive and next to the 17 miles drive and a a 10 min drive to Carmel. Plenty of linen and blankets. The heating system was very effective. Will love to stay again on our next trip to Monterrey.  "
11641733,166871942,2017-07-04,28626875,Marc,Great location. Very close to all the attractions in the Monterey area. House is cozy and comfortable. No cable TV so make sure you bring computer/Ipad/etc. that has the ability to do HDMI out. Place has everything you need to have a relaxing stay.
11641733,168617406,2017-07-09,3423056,Felix,"If you are having a tough time looking for a place in the Monterey area close to all the attractions but feels like a second home, look no further! 

Abby, is extremely easy to work with, making checking-in and out a breeze. Aside from the perfect communication, her Home is exactly what a small family or a large family needs. Her Home is very cozy yet has space to have privacy. 

An absolute game winner about Abby's home, is the large projector with all hookups ready at the helm to use to watch your favorite Netflix show via an HDMI connection on a laptop. 

Abby provided a handbook in the kitchen with everything we needed to know about the house and, tips and tricks around Monterey. 

I highly recommend booking with Abby and I am looking forward to booking again with her next year! "
11641733,171091517,2017-07-16,35028876,Jack,Great Location.  Easy access to everything in Monterey you want!
11641733,172406480,2017-07-20,138833678,Lucille,"I usually don't write reviews, but with Abby's lovely house and being a responsible host, I have to write a positive feedback . All previous reviewers have said true facts about Abby's place and convenient location. What impressed us was Abby placed little decors here and there every corner in the house, there's also an already plugin night light ! Abby made every effort to make her guest to feel like being home ! Her house might not be the greatest in the listing, but the value is way over it ! I highly recommend Abby's house and definitely will rebook her house if I ever return for vacation. Thanks again, Abby, for putting your love in the house for your guests !

*** This's an extra note Nothing to do with Abby's place - my Airbnb account was unauthorized  login at Union City, CA when I was already checked in at Pacific Grove. Airbnb promptly alerted me, although I only have time right now to response to the alert message. No matter how careful we are to guard our account, things still happened ."
11641733,181459903,2017-08-12,145216637,Eduardo,"My wife and I were pleasantry surprised with this home. We both very much appreciated the HDMI and projector, as well as the piano and guitar with music books. The Boze speaker was definitely the cherry on top. Also, Abby was amazing. We purchased travel books about the Central California, but Abby was willing and able to tailor our outings based on our demographics and interest. Thank you so much for helping us enjoy that region."
11641733,185075177,2017-08-20,83570614,Tamir,"This place is fantastic!  Amazing location, very clean and well laid out.  The projector screen was a huge bonus.  Communication was super easy with Abby, and the check in process was super smooth.  I highly recommend this spot and I look forward to hopefully staying there again next year.  Thank you!"

Convenient location for Pebble Beach"
11641733,188252624,2017-08-28,21526478,Stacie,"What a lovely time we had here, all of us, big and small! The house is a perfect mix of well-appointed style and well-stocked comfort for kids and adults alike. And from the beach to dining out, we were never more than a ten minute drive from everywhere we wanted to go. On top of the great location and amenities, Abby & Jeff were such kind and responsive hosts. We definitely hope to return here someday. Cheers!"
11641733,190733891,2017-09-04,73869358,Jennifer,"This is a fantastic location. Very close to Monterey bay aquarium, the wharf, and more. Abby is a wonderful host and her home is very cozy and clean."
11641733,203855724,2017-10-15,5196110,Rolf,"The place is super homey and nice - we felt at ease right away, as did the kids. The kitchen clearly gets used a lot to cook, and is well equipped.

We very much enjoyed our stay there. Whale watching is on our must-do list whenever coming to Monterey - and this time was as awesome as ever."
11680976,74145004,2016-05-13,66669215,Mark,"House was exactly as advertised.  Very nice, historic home.  It was within walking distance to most activities , which was great.

"
11680976,75804770,2016-05-23,35999681,Jeffrey,"Super easy check-in. Great location, close to beach, shops and restaurants. Perfect place to getaway from it all. Master bedroom has great view over oceanfront. Combines old rustic with modern amenities. Big dining table makes great place to play boardames.
"
11680976,77332340,2016-05-31,20482909,Sarah,Beautifully maintained cottage on a quiet residential street just 5 minutes walk from cafes and restaurants and 10 minutes walk to the coastline. We appreciated the detailed binder of local info and tips. Christine was very responsive and friendly - thank you!
11680976,79377405,2016-06-12,68138707,Mark,We had a great stay at the sea lion house. The house has a lot of character and is in great location with restaurants and things to do near by. Would love to stay here again! 
11680976,80724925,2016-06-19,34161589,Melody,"The host is very nice and organized, everything we need to know was well written and put on the wall. She also serve a bottle of wine to welcome us. We really love the house & enjoy our time in there. We were very surprise how big but cozy the place is. This is really a nicer airbnb to stay in. If we ever come back again, this would be the top choice for us. "
11680976,84188506,2016-07-05,40981592,Ivan,The house was very nice and in a quiet neighborhood. Christine left everything for us and was so easy to deal with. The town is beautiful and close to all the sights in the area. 
11680976,86220587,2016-07-15,21660102,Valency,"We had a wonderful time in Christine's home! The home is beautiful and historic, and has been updated to honor that history. We found it very clean and comfortable. Plenty of luxurious details.

The location was perfect for our needs, as well. We walked to the Aquarium in just under 20 minutes. The neighborhood is charming, with fun details to spot along the way.

We had 5 people sleeping here, and had plenty of room. It was nice to have 2 living areas (the living room, and the lower area of the master bedroom). The kids and adults could spread out and not be on top of each other.

Definitely a top rental! Thanks for enhancing our vacation."
11680976,86992938,2016-07-18,74350426,Rachel,"This charming home has the perfect location for a long weekend getaway. We walked everywhere once we arrived (beach, restaurants in the quaint downtown, Monterey Bay Aquarium, etc); we never moved our car until it was time to leave Pacific Grove! Christine takes great care of her home, and the framed photos she took around the house are especially lovely. "
11680976,88455009,2016-07-24,61331356,Daniel,Very beautiful home. Our family absolutely love it. Being so close to the beach and so close to the restaurants was amazing. 
11680976,91692021,2016-08-06,69992826,Trisha,"Sea lion house is a wonderful comfortable house in a quiet road in Pacific grove.  Shops and restaurants were close by as was the beach.  Monterey is a short walk along the coast.  We had a fantastic time and my boys aged 12 and 9 loved watching the seals, Dolphins and whales! we would definitely recommend Pacific grove as a great location and sea lion house as a wonderful place to stay."
11680976,92229037,2016-08-08,55195679,Bernadette,"The house is fantastic! Very comfortable, lots of amenities!  
Christine was fast to respond. She texted to make sure we were able to get inside the house with no problem. Easy rental process, liked 3pm check- in which is an hour earlier than other rentals. 
We enjoyed our stay. Thank you Christine for sharing your home with us!"
11680976,93127221,2016-08-11,80655087,Stephanie,"Great house! Very comfortable and nice location. The house is as beautiful as in the photos. Included in the decor are a variety of fantastic local underwater pictures which add a nice touch. When the weather was good, the back patio was a nice place to sit. We also loved its proximity to the water and being able to walk to the shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove. "
11680976,93757754,2016-08-13,4170286,Alex,"My family and I really enjoyed Christine's unique, beautifully-styled house! It has a easy code for check-in (makes all the difference when we might make spontaneous roadtrip stops), and is a few blocks from the beach (and a few more blocks to the Aquarium and grocery.)

This is the FIRST time I've stayed somewhere with clear (and fun) signage on how to use the showers, faucet, kitchenware. There's also a binder of thoughtful resources for those looking for wine, scenery, or family fun! Christine's thoughtfulness and experience design shines through."
11680976,94486520,2016-08-15,42200085,Alison,"Sea Lion house was just as described. The pictures were accurate and if anything, it was better than the pictures. Christine was easy to communicate with. We appreciated the bottle of wine. Her signs and information were easy to read and not annoying. We needed three bedrooms and this worked out perfectly. The house is a real treasure with the beautiful woodwork and antique pieces. The location was perfect. We were able to walk to our pre wedding dinner at the nearby Crema cafe and also to many other shops and restaurants. We only wish we could have stayed longer."
11680976,96342622,2016-08-22,8960491,Juan,Exactly as represented online. A great place to stay for the vintage races and pebble beach concours. Just make sure your car is not too low if you want to use the garage. My stock M5 barely cleared the driveway crest.
11680976,99515673,2016-09-05,71577608,Daphne,Nice neighborhood; several messages prior to arrival with all necessary information; Several books in unit giving all necessary and helpful information; charming historic home;  well furnished; pleasing maritime theme.  
11680976,101139782,2016-09-12,68752908,Stephanie,"Christine made everything very clear in her instructions so getting in, having a comfortable stay, and checking out were all easy. The house was clean and beautiful. It had everything we needed - even a hairdryer! The location was near places to eat and was a nice distance from the water and Lover's point. The driveway is pretty steep so be cautious. We had 3 couples staying and there was plenty of space. One thing to note is that the master bedroom is much larger than the other two bedrooms and has 1.5 bathrooms on its half of the house but just 1 bathroom on the side with two bedrooms. This wasn't a problem at all but was the only surprise for us in scoping out the space compared the the photos/listing. Overall: kind and organized host, clean and beautiful house with many amenities, quiet location in walking distance from the ocean and food spots. I highly recommend!"
11680976,102750740,2016-09-19,85021412,Noriel,A wonderful house to stay in.  My family loved every minute. 
11680976,106577613,2016-10-07,7873024,Steve,"This house is better than the pictures describe. I'm not sure how to take the pics, but it basically has 2 sides, each with bedrooms, living space, and full baths, connected by the kitchen. Perfect for 2 adult couples traveling together. A really nice place I would love to stay at again. Location, is terrific as well."
11680976,108642209,2016-10-16,26816807,Andy,"The house was perfect for our trip to the area and even better than the pictures.  There were 5 of us and we had plenty of room to spread out when we wanted and hang out together as well.  It was a gorgeous place in a lovely neighborhood with beautiful views.  Everything was well labeled and convenient within walking distance.  We enjoyed the bottle of wine to welcome us and Christine was super responsive. The driveway is a bit tricky but parking on the street was easy. I will definately stay there again when I am in the area.
"
11680976,109930509,2016-10-23,34011291,Jaypal,"Its pretty rare to have a description so accurate to the experience. Truly loved the stay. You can tell Christine makes a lot of effort to keep this property in great shape and provide a super experience. We'll definitely stay here again. 

thanks! "
11680976,116025799,2016-11-27,11586364,Kavitha,Christine was quick to respond. The location of the house is perfect -- within walking distance of many attractions. 
11680976,122044070,2016-12-20,1984788,Jim,"The house is a total gem! Plenty of room for our two families, a GREAT backyard with a chiminea that we sat by after the kids went down. It's walkable to some incredible restaurants and a 4 minute drive down to the aquarium. Highly recommend! "
11680976,122919941,2016-12-26,61100630,Bryce,"Very cozy organized and thorough.  Everything was awesome and loved all the helpful notes through out the house.  Really impressed with how organized everything was and very peaceful perfect place for some family time and R&R!  Perfect place to spend the holidays and loved Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel.  

Only downsides:  The fridge was too small and check out at noon would be much better.  We would likely be out before noon, but hotel hop a lot and noon seems to be the perfect time for myself and those who I travel with.  Also, one thing my Mom noticed was the windows were dirty...lol, she is an heart nurse so of course she would notice something like that."
11680976,123795747,2016-12-30,44708512,Ed,"The Sea Lion House was perfect for our group of 7.  We walked in all directions from the house, which is convenient to downtown Pacific Grove especially, but also to Lover's Point and the Aquarium.  Christine was easy to contact over the very minor issue which arose (... I was unfamiliar with how the lock box worked).  A delightful place!"
11680976,124371487,2017-01-01,652423,Garrett,"A few friends and I had a great, quiet stay at Christine's house for New Years. The house is old, charming, and private within the neighborhood. It's a short walk to Lover's Point and an amazing walking path that stretches up both sides of the coast. We had a great time."
11680976,130400742,2017-02-05,1148880,Kate,"Lovely home, great separation of space, close to ocean and walkable to aquarium. Christine was lovely to communicate with, which made for an easy, comfortable stay. Highly recommended! "
11680976,134337227,2017-02-26,110353054,Kenneth,Sea Lion House is a wonderful stay. We had a family of six adults and a six-year-old grandson. Great spaces for gathering together and for individual privacy. Beautiful view of the bay from the upstairs master. All instructions for the stay were nicely laid out in notebooks. Christine's passion for marine photography are displayed throughout the house. 
11680976,135688350,2017-03-05,13483064,Micaela,"The Sea Lion House was a perfect fit for our group of 7! Everyone had plenty of space without being on top of each other. The house is a short walk to cute little shops and restaurants, as well as a short drive to downtown Monterey and Cannery Row. We will absolutely stay here again next time we visit the area! "
11680976,136965678,2017-03-12,91499887,Mark,"A great place - large, roomy and relaxed.  We would stay there again for sure.  "
11680976,138040051,2017-03-18,74352898,Sung,"Christine's place is very nice and a good testimony to antique house preservation.  It's spacious enough to comfortably accommodate 5 adults, and the neighborhood is very quiet and close enough to the  beach and city amenities.  But it is a little tricky in parking the car, particularly, a mini-van or larger vehicle, into the garage or even on the sloped driveway.  Curbside parking is generally available, however.  Unfortunately, internet connections in the house are not fast, and therefore, internet addicts may have to rely more on their own cell phones for watching online streaming programs.  The host does provide very good tourist information in the house and that could be a good time saver.  "
11680976,141336963,2017-04-02,92192943,Stan,"Very clean and well appointed. We enjoyed being at this house which was close to several restaurants and a few block from the ocean front, particularly Lover's Point.  "
11680976,142330914,2017-04-07,80829070,Charlotte,"The house is in a wonderful location very close to resteraunts, shops and the beach.  Short drive or walk to monterey.   Christine left a lovely bottle of wine to welcome us! The house is historic and well preserved but with that a little basic also the layout is a bit unusual. We were 6 and a baby. It was tight to share."
11680976,146725468,2017-04-23,42675202,Kevin,"Christine's Property is a beautiful historic home situated in the central part of Pacific Grove. 

My group was there for a wedding in Pebble Beach and the house was only an 8 minute Uber drive away. 

Our group didn't spend too much time in the house itself simply because there is so much to do in the area. On our first day, we ate at Peppers Mexican Grill just down the street. The atmosphere was great as well as the food and service. The ingredients all tasted extremely fresh (seemed to be a trend in the area)! That night we went to our first event at a driving range in Pebble, which was incredible. 

On our second day, we woke up and ate at Crema. We missed the brunch (make sure to get there before 11:15). The food was delicious, so much so that we had to go back on the third day. Make sure to get their chicken and waffles! 

In regards to the house... it is cozy with plenty of space and sleeping area. The bed that I slept in was extremely comfortable. My friends also said the same about their sleeping arrangements. 

We would recommend staying in this house. 

"
11680976,148449941,2017-04-30,22245909,Christina,"This house is great for large groups. The master bedroom is in its own wing and has a second living room which is awesome if you are traveling with kids. We had hot water issues during our stay, which Christine responded promptly to. 
The house has the basics (linens, plates, cups) but there are not toiletries if you are looking for that, and you may need to restock on trash bags, paper towels, etc during the stay. 
All in all, a great location and a lot of space!"
11680976,149311505,2017-05-03,58101027,Rafael & Lisa,"Marvelous Pacific Grove! Charming, rustic home, excellent location, good wifi, clear and easy directions!"
11680976,150635322,2017-05-08,24176459,Pauline,Extremely comfortable stay and great location in Pacific Grove. Hassle free check in and communication. Thanks!
11680976,154082679,2017-05-22,6459167,Valerie,"Our family of five had a very happy 4 night visit at Sea Lion Properties. The home is perfect in every way, and most importantly provided us the opportunity to stay together and yet enjoy our privacy when desired.
This was my second trip to the Monterey area, and both times I chose accommodations in Pacific Grove. I love its shops,cafes,and the people are helpful and friendly. Christine's home is central to everything and that means a short walk to the water! 
The home itself is wonderful...very,very lovely inside and out, but also quite comfortable. 
I would stay there again in a ""New York Minute."" We all loved it.
Regarding your host Christine, she is very friendly, thorough,and quick to respond. She has organized the home perfectly.
Happy travels to all!
"
11680976,157841820,2017-06-04,125988206,Stephanie,Christine has thought of everything. House is clean and well stocked with essentials. Notes through the house are helpful hints.
11680976,159834589,2017-06-11,7168043,Alessandra,Beautiful home! Great area! Walkable distance to PG and Cannery Row. Would stay here again if the opportunity presents itself. Very responsive host!
11680976,160335767,2017-06-13,119039106,Austin,"Recently had a 2 night stay at Sea Lion House in Pacific Grove. Everything was as stated or better, location was a short walk from the beach and close to many restaurants/shops. Had a great time and Christine was super easy to reach and always quick to respond/helpful when needed. Would definitely recommend a stay at the Sea Lion house!"
11680976,164575774,2017-06-28,4831510,Roy,The location and home are both fantastic! Very peaceful and quiet. Perfect for a small family getaway. Will hopefully get the chance to stay here again!
11680976,167091595,2017-07-05,122678671,James,"We really enjoyed staying here! We are a family of four with a 12 year old and a 15 year old and it was nice for everyone to have their own space. Everything in the house was exactly as Christine described. We had no trouble finding the house or checking in and out. She has clear instructions for how to use all of the appliances, thermostat, etc. so no issues there either. The beds were comfortable and everything was super clean.

The location is perfect- as it is in a very quiet neighborhood (which we appreciated) but also within walking distance to so many things! We walked to the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, Cannery Row, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.  We also enjoyed good coffee down the street at Carmel Valley Coffee Roasters. There is a nice path right down the street that you can walk/run/bike on. 

Christine has some binders full of information about restaurants, parks, hiking and lots of other local activities. It was very nice to have! 

We would definitely stay here again and recommend it! "
11680976,168085075,2017-07-08,34951670,Andrea,We loved the historic beauty of the house and the area. The view from that area is wonderful. Thanks for making this a great weekend for our family.

11680976,173653009,2017-07-23,1833518,Stephanie,"This place has everything: views of the ocean, quick walk to major places in PG, quick access to the recreation trail for running, walking and taking in the views, and more. The photos do not do this beautiful home justice - it is just perfect. We absolutely adored the outside area and loved how close we were to everything. We never drove because we could walk everywhere! Not to mention, the beds were so comfortable. Thank you very much! I will definitely stay here again if I'm ever in PG :)"
11680976,174373427,2017-07-25,127570489,Beverly,"Beautiful, immaculate, well-equipped"

The house is a beautiful historic home in the heart of Pacific Grove, within walking distance of many restaurants, shops, the beach, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We really enjoyed all the helpful laminated tips around the house, and descriptions of some historic features (like the ""Winchester door""!). The house was also very clean and well organized, and the check-in process was easy. We all had a great time, and would love to stay here again next time we're in the area! "

11680976,204140192,2017-10-16,11694152,Rebecca,This historic house is beautiful and located on a quiet street close to the beach. The master bedroom is set apart from the other two bedrooms and kitchen to enable two families with small kids to stay comfortably. My husband and I celebrated my daughter's 2nd birthday here with our mothers and a couple relatives. The garden and deck make a serene hangout after a day at the aquarium and beach. Christine is a lovely host with great suggestions for local activities and restaurants. The complimentary bottle of wine was a lovely touch.
11680976,206115535,2017-10-23,134883344,Peggy,"We had a fantastic ""ladies retreat"" at the Sea Lion House! The home is beautiful, historic & charming. We especially loved all the little touches to the home that really made staying there memorable.  Christine was an exceptional host, quick & accommodating in her responses.

The location is top notch- everything is a short walk (or drive) away, but walking is worth it to take in the gorgeous scenery! It's also a short drive into Carmel-by -the-Sea and the Carmel Valley (which we frequented for the amazing wine tasting). Walking along the commercial pier we even had a close up encounter with a friendly sea lion, which seemed fitting given our stay at the Sea Lion House. I very much recommend booking a stay- you will be charmed by the home, awed by the sights, and warmed by the memories made."
11680976,207771407,2017-10-29,79968838,Tomas,Fantastic house with style and everything you need.
11680976,222060940,2017-12-28,4255129,Susan,"Sea Lion is a lovely property. Comfortably equipped. Kitchen is more than adequate for preparing meals.  Great proximity to town, shopping, beach, restaurants and Aquarium.  Great privacy for master suite with its own 1/4 bath in loft next to bedroom and full bath downstairs next to private living room. ""Older"" part of house has two small bedrooms (full beds) and share a full bath.
Open dining area and living room. Very nice grill."
11680976,227433444,2018-01-14,22297302,Marcin,"Wonderful location, very clean and lots of room (3 bedrooms plus two sofas). A large house in a residential location that is close to Monterey and other places. Christine is very helpful and responds quickly. Highly recommended."
11680976,230732347,2018-01-28,91362381,Sara,Great place! 
11680976,232859176,2018-02-06,6377613,Leah,"This is a top-notch, well-run rental.  The house is charming and spacious.  The location is great, a lovely walk to the beach and aquarium and any restaurants or shops you desire!  Christine was helpful and thoughtfully checked in on us.  The kids loved the bonus playroom in the master suite!  We had a great vacation here and highly recommend!"
11680976,233708139,2018-02-10,26011453,Tiffany,"The living areas are breathtaking and the little backyard and kitchen are cute as can be. The downstairs bathroom is a bit difficult for bathing, but with another full bath and 1/2 bath, there's a workaround for that. I would stay again!"
11680976,236901711,2018-02-20,115093039,Vanessa,An ideal retreat for our Presidents' Weekend trip.  The house was charming and had the perfect layout for our family.  We will stay here again!

11680976,245068963,2018-03-20,129288483,Joseph,The home was quaint and comfortable. The little play room upstairs was an added bonus for our two young children. Is within a mile walking distance to the aquarium but a scenic walk. Would recommend to other families.
11680976,246641812,2018-03-25,42249219,Sarah,"A lovely home, in a great location!  Loved walking Pacific Grove -  all the restaurants and shops.  Excellent proximity to the Aquarium.  And a good jumping off point for adventures south into Big Sur.  Christine was helpful and very responsive."
11680976,248143364,2018-03-30,63588042,Denise,"This place is a great place to rent for 2 families master sweet is separated from the 2 bedrooms in the front of the house ,2 full baths & 1/2 bath! Perfect location! We loved everything about the house!"
11680976,250335323,2018-04-04,122935564,Jahan,"Perfect for families- at bedtime, there’s plenty of room to spread out. For family time, the master suite is huge! The outdoor space is great as well."
11680976,254039262,2018-04-15,7131414,Luke,"This place is fantastic. Very nicely appointed, great light and flow. Nontraditional layout and generous spaces. Great location and really sweet neighborhood. Highly recommended :)"
11910433,66644043,2016-03-23,63642130,Amy,"We loved this townhome and its owner!  Bill told us we were the first people to stay here and it was obvious.  Everything was brand-spanking new and squeaky clean.  I've stayed in many condos on vacation, but have never had such royal treatment.  They provided a bowl of fresh fruit, two bottles of wine, a gorgeous vase of fresh flowers, coffee, and some staples in the fridge and pantry.  Way above and beyond my expectations.

The home itself is small but beautifully decorated.  Tasteful nautical/beach themed decor, local art and photos.  The upstairs has vaulted, white-washed wood ceilings.  The bedding is beautiful and comfy, with tons of extra pillows and blankets.

The main living area is a bit dark as the house is built into a hill, so it's partially underground.  But off to the side is a little nook with a very comfy chair and ottoman placed directly beneath a skylight.  My son and I had to fight each other for that chair!  The living area has a TV with cable and a gas fireplace.

The kitchen has everything you'd need.  Pots, pans, utensils, dishes, microwave, coffee pot, etc.  It's not huge but has plenty of counterspace to prepare meals.

It's only a short walk (maybe 7 mins?) to the beach and about 15 minutes to the aquarium, Starbucks and restaurants.  Perfect location.

The only downsides to the home are that both bathrooms are pretty small (very little counterspace to get ready), and have very loud fans that turn on automatically when you turn on the lights.  Also, the home shares a wall with another unit.  Although those tenants were perfectly quiet, you could easily hear their TV, the fan in their bathrooms, footsteps, etc.  They were up late and this interrupted my sleep.  But then again, I'm a really light sleeper.   We were gone most of the day, so the daytime sounds didn't bother us."
11910433,67321913,2016-03-28,12450131,Chris,"Bill is a great host. Very prompt with answering any questions or inquires. Upon arrival, we were greeted with detailed information on house with thorough walk-through and even the wine gifts! House is very clean and well maintained, and all the amenities are well equipped. Super friendly and overall highly recommended!! Would definitely stay again at Bill's when visiting Monterey."
11910433,68532315,2016-04-05,63745429,Debbie,"This is a nice two bedroom place with plenty of room and in a great location.  Walk to the waterfront area and Monterey Bay aquarium  in less than 15 minutes, small grocery store and places to eat also within walking distance.  Neighborhood is very quiet.  Nicely furnished unit with plenty of supplies in the kitchen.  The owners met us when we checked in and had fruit on table and coffee and tea available for the morning.  They were available by phone if needed.  You will enjoy your stay."
11910433,69347671,2016-04-10,44680092,Kuldeep,"We had a great experience at Bill's rental place. We were a group of 5 adults. The place is spacious and neat and clean. The kitchen has all the utensils needed to cook. There are board games in the house, which we enjoyed playing both the nights. The house is close to many sight seeing spots. I would highly recommend this place. Bill and Kelly were prompt at responding to our queries. They even allowed us a late checkout. Overall it was a very nice weekend for us."
11910433,70271288,2016-04-17,18878248,Anika,"Bill was a great host!  The house was perfect and had all the items we needed for a fun and relaxing vacation. Beds were super comfortable, all linens provided and even had shampoo/conditioner in the shower. My kids felt at home, we had more than enough space for 3 adults and 3kids.  Definitely going back!  "
11910433,72530609,2016-05-03,7400250,Jacob,"We stayed here for an extra-long weekend with our two-year old son. We had a great time! It's a short walk down to the rec path and, from there, a beautiful walk towards Lovers Point or Cannery Row. It's also a short walk to downtown Pacific Grove. It's on a very quiet block (although I'm not sure a loud block even exists in PG)."
11910433,73635694,2016-05-09,19534516,Seth,"My family had a wonderful time at Bill's ""Coastal Getaway"". Not sure if it was the comfortable bed or the surroundings, but had some of my most peaceful sleep in a long time.

Loved waking up in the morning, opening the windows and hearing the birds chirping. The serene backyard was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Was able to meditate out there both days and felt very calm.

Proximity to shops in Pacific Grove was also a bonus. Had not visited that part of town before, having restricted myself to Monterey previously.

While in town you have to check out Lover's Point and the beaches, The Red House Cafe and their smoked salmon, and Passionfish for dinner. All excellent finds.

Thanks for the wonderful experience, and the tea! We will be back."
11910433,94959428,2016-08-17,63805664,Frank,"房子太小了,楼上只有一个很小的卫生间,很不方便。照片显示是全幢房子,实际只能用一半,另一半还有人住,车库也不能用。厨房用具比较齐全。"
11910433,97059512,2016-08-25,83138587,Leo,Made to feel wonderfully welcome and the house was truly gorgeous!

The space was very clean, nicely decorated, it had a well-stocked kitchen and just nice to stay in. The location was perfect, walking distance to many good eats, the aquarium and more. Would definitely come back!"

The host was great, she greeted us and took her time to explain everything regarding the house and also great tour guide! 

Highly recommend this place. "
11910433,107287807,2016-10-09,6134658,Nicole,Kelly was a warm and welcoming host and the communication was wonderful right from the moment we booked. The house is in the most perfect location and I am absolutely in love with how charming the pacific grove area is. The house is lovely and the kitchen is well stocked. It's walking distance to the cute downtown area and just a few blocks from the beach. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
11910433,108641374,2016-10-16,88225172,Melissa,The photos where accurate. Place was clean and location was good.  The check in was made very easy.
11910433,109639004,2016-10-22,41645903,Lucas,It's a great location and was super clean. Our only knock was that the walls are thin and we could hear everything including the squirrels running back and forth on the roof. Thank you for lending our place to us.
11910433,112627842,2016-11-06,57572994,Kelcy,"This was such a great stay! Bill and Kelly were very responsive, informative and had I needed anything I don't doubt they would have been helpful, but everything was smooth sailing. 
The place: clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities we could need for our girls weekend. Beds were comfortable and bedding was clean. We didn't do much cooking but kitchen seemed stocked. We even discovered a small stash of board games and playing cards that was a nice surprise! The location was perfect. Within walking (or short driving) distance of the aquarium and cannery row, great restaurants, the bike path along the coast and grocery store. Really nice, quiet neighborhood. 
We had 4 women staying here and it was the perfect size. 6 could fit but would be cozy. 4 was comfortable."
11910433,113762091,2016-11-13,90541003,Mika,"The house was wonderful, our hosts communicated things well with us!  We especially loved the location of this house, only two blocks from the water and 15 min walk to cannery row.  We will definitely come back!"
11910433,116080123,2016-11-27,82837545,Sue, Highly recommend.  Extremely comfortable and centrally located to multiple places
11910433,125036945,2017-01-03,54063050,Robbi,"Our stay here was delightful! Everything about it was exceptional, from the location to the comfortable home equipped with everything we needed to cook and dine. The couches and beds were very comfortable, the bedding and towels were of great quality.  Bill communicated with us prior to and during our stay. Our walk to the beach was short and easy, as well as scenic. We truly enjoyed our 8 days there, and would do it again in a heartbeat. The house provided comfortable space for four people. We felt privileged to be able to stay there. Excellent experience! Thank you so much for all that you did to make our stay special, meaningful and AMAZING!
"
11910433,128136559,2017-01-22,111810618,Jared,"Cozy place just barely out of the way from main tourist roads but still walkable to great coffee, food, shops and the coast. Kitchen is well stocked with items for convenience, basic spices, and even wine glasses. Unexpected coffee pot and towels were nice/soft. Parking is a plentiful but tight on small streets. Several neighbors have dogs, all well very behaved, we didnt hear them once aside from the mailman. You'll enjoy this rest spot while visiting the greater Monterey area"
11910433,129202497,2017-01-29,17084057,Peter,"Great place to stay and use as base to explore the beautiful area. We did not meet Bill , but had very good communication and everything was as it should be

11910433,133468995,2017-02-22,64429943,Doranna,"This was a great home base for our Aquarium trip.  It is exactly as advertised, clean and quiet.  It rained the whole time we were there, but that didn't get us down because we knew we could always go back to the place and hang out comfortably.  It's a duplex, but we rarely heard the neighbors.  Very quiet part of town.  If it hadn't of been raining, we would've walked to the aquarium and maybe some parks.  Another time, perhaps. "
11910433,133767129,2017-02-24,14816525,Brooke & Karl,"We had a wonderful stay at Bill & Kelly's ""Coastal Get Away"". Great location, we walked to the Monterey Bay Aquarium one day and went biking on the amazing coastal trail the next. The house was clean & cozy and communication was super smooth."
11910433,135669034,2017-03-05,111833709,Perynn,The house is incredibly cute and clean. Felt like we were home! Check in was easy even with our odd schedules and communication was prompt! Would for sure stay here next time we are in the area !!! Thank you for making our weekend so seemless and comfortable.

11910433,140950506,2017-04-01,20234919,Mandy,"This home is in a great location within walking distance of many of the local amenities including the Aquarium and Oceanside paths. Towels and sheets were great, though we could not locate any extra blankets in the home. The lower level is somewhat odd as the living room is in a basement with only one window that provides little light. The home functioned just fine for our family, however. Check-in was easy and the home was very clean."
11910433,146828778,2017-04-23,119779976,Carson,This place was great. Thanks Bill!

11910433,159789707,2017-06-11,18175507,Alison,"We went to Monterey for a friends' weekend and stayed at Bill's place. The location is in a nice, quiet residential area, but near enough to walk to several shops and places to eat. The home itself is very nice and clean. We had 6 adults in our party and it comfortably fit us all. They have all the basic kitchen appliances, cookware and dishware so we didn't have worry about packing anything extra. Bill was extremely easy to communicate with and provided clear directions and access instructions well in advance of our arrival. He was quick to respond to a couple of questions upon our arrival. Overall, no issues and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I'd definitely recommend Bill's place."
11910433,164561741,2017-06-28,127102173,Michelle,"This was a great place to stay.  Bill was great

11910433,177739310,2017-08-03,132872363,Kinley,"Our stay at Bill's property in Pacific Grove, CA was wonderful! The property was prepared for us when we arrived and had everything we needed. We were able to walk to many different places because the location was in a great area. Because we were traveling as a group of 6 (the total able to stay at the property) the space was a little tight for us, but we were out and about in the town most of the day so it didn't really matter. Thanks for having us, Bill!"
11910433,180228175,2017-08-09,90541003,Mika,"This is our second time staying here and we absolutely love this property!  It is walking distance to the aquarium, Cannery Row, and to the quaint little shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove.  The property is in great condition, the kitchen is perfect for making meals, there are plenty of towels to use, and the washer/dryer is so convenient to have when you have kids!  We will be returning soon!"

Centrally and conveniently located for picking up bits, walking out for food and drinks and also visiting all Monterey/Pacific Grove facilities including Fishermans Wharf, Cannery Row and the Aquarium.

Communication was excellent as was info left in house. Bill accommodated a schedule change on our side with no issues when we changed our plans and decided to arrive a day later.

Thanks again,

Garth and Tessa"
11910433,190991956,2017-09-05,1242810,Adrienne,Great location.  It's a very close walk to shops and restaurants. Perfect place for a family to stay .  The place was very clean and fresh and inviting.
11910433,192994474,2017-09-11,16021537,Samantha,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Coastal Getaway :) We felt the house was well represented in the photos and description, allowing us to know exactly what to expect. The house itself had everything we needed to make it feel like a home during our stay and we were able to walk into town and enjoy everything the area had to offer - which was just what we were hoping! We greatly appreciated the ease of communication with Bill and Kelly throughout the whole process too. Also, there was a binder of house/local information, along with a lot of literature provided for events/restaurants around town and it was so helpful to us out-of-towners...and a wonderful touch to make us feel welcomed to the area! Definitely would recommend :)"
11910433,194881988,2017-09-17,16188471,Juan,Great location!

12027823,93368297,2016-08-12,83800195,Glenn,"We had such a great time! Four of us stayed here for a birthday celebration.  We stayed in the lobby in late afternoon drinking wine and marveling at the ocean view!  Warm, Charming yet Elegant!  Highly recommend!    "
12027823,137339395,2017-03-14,79439347,Jason,"Wow!  This place is beautiful!    It is right on the coast, impeccably furnished, clean, and very organized.   We stayed in the detached Sea View cottage which was plenty of room for a family of four.  It had a private patio out back and superb amenities inside.   We kept saying to ourselves ""oh, they thought of that too"" as everything we needed was in the room.   This cottage is part of the Seven Gables Inn and the morning breakfast was well run and tasty.   I could strongly recommend this location for a few nights as you can get to Monterey easily.   The larger Inn in would be a photogenic place for a small wedding party to stay if you could get enough rooms.   We walked to a nearby restaurant and had a very nice meal.    I would stay here again.   "
12053553,68623997,2016-04-05,4648071,Sarah,"This cottage was a delightful place to spend a weekend, and we'd totally go back. It's less than a block from the shoreline, with beautiful views from the patio and front windows.

Jonathan was extremely hospitable -- welcomed us, gave us recommendations on good walks in the area, and was available to answer any questions. When the oven wouldn't light, he set up the grill for us to cook our steaks there.

The cottage is attached to the host's home, so you can hear occasional water running, but it still feels private. I noticed a few cobwebs but overall it was very clean. The kitchen is stocked with pans, dishes, etc., so you can cook your own meals if you like. (Go to the Grove Market for delicious produce and a great meat selection!)

Overall it was a great place to stay and I'm looking forward to visiting again someday."
12053553,78406977,2016-06-06,23913961,Andy,"This is an amazing little place!!  We loved every minute we were there and every inch of the place.  It's pretty obvious it is taken care of with love.  Everything is very clean and neat.  The ocean and the beach walk is just a block away.  Very quite.  1.5 miles from Monterey Aquarium, nice easy walk.  The yard is immaculate and every plant is taken care of.  Very cozy.  Comfy bed and pillows.  Nice linens and towels.  Would highly recommend and we will stay here again, given the chance.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!  "
12053553,81444994,2016-06-23,2070203,Andrew,"Looking for a quiet, relaxing place to sip coffee or afternoon cocktails feeling the ocean breeze?  Then this is your place in Monterrey.  Out of all the AirBNB stays that I've had, this cute little apartment is adjacent to one of the most beautiful gardens I've ever seen.  Just pure relaxation and just minutes always from plenty to do.  "
12053553,81668943,2016-06-24,11602256,Peter,"Christine and I had a great time staying at the Ocean View cottage :)
Spacious and clean with all the necessities to take in the local sights, 
Jonathan and Adriana were excellent to deal with - gracious and helpful. They have a beautifully cultivated garden where you can catch up on a book or an email. There is a tranquil ocean view and park a 90 second walk away. We enjoyed hearing about Adriana's travels! Would definitely recommend. "
12053553,86775558,2016-07-17,26267013,Karin,"The location, peace and quiet, bed was super comfy, lots of amenities and the hosts were very approachable.  The garden was beautiful with spectacular ocean views a block away.  Lots of privacy even though attached to main residence. Would stay again."

12053553,100740836,2016-09-10,85381238,Nancy,"We were graciously greeted and sent off. We got lost coming in and phoned for directions, and Adriana sat out on the wall in front to guide us in and to the parking. When asked via phone if there was a coffee grinder, our host didn't have one, but then provided it! Jonathan and Adriana were very knowledgeable about the area, available at all times, friendly and helpful. We enjoyed hearing from them the history of the cottage and how the spot is definitely part of the history of  Pacific Grove. The cottage was comfortable in every way, has a well equipped kitchen for light cooking. We are elderly, and it was nice to have outdoor lighting automatically come on at night as we came in. We would gladly go again."
12053553,115735426,2016-11-26,62012881,Kari,"Jonathan went out of his way to help make the ""check-in"" process go smoothly. His wife was in the cottage when I arrived. She is very sweet. 
The bed is comfortable, the fireplace cozy, the garden is beautiful and the location is perfect!"

12053553,146808443,2017-04-23,22019068,Elizabeth,"We had an incredible weekend stay at Jonathan and Adrianna's cottage. They are wonderful hosts. The cottage is perfectly located- walkable to the aquarium, amazing views, kitchen if you want to stay in and the patio is perfect for morning coffee or a glass of wine while you watch the sunset. We highly recommend a visit!"
12053553,177750237,2017-08-03,21055771,Akash,"Jonathan has a beautiful home on Monterey. It was fully stocked with towels, soap, plates and cups. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets were soft. Really enjoyed our stay here and the location was prime.  "
12053553,197493027,2017-09-25,3717964,Cameron,Lovely Airbnb. Extremely close to the water and all that gorgeous Monterey has to offer. We were lucky enough to enjoy wine from the patio and saw several whales in the bay. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a seaside stay.
12053553,208940138,2017-11-03,152661084,Carlos,Cute place nice location!
12053553,211412229,2017-11-12,9279718,Alison,"This place is amazing! My husband and I were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were so happy to have found this gem! Cute, quaint, cozy and within 1 block to the ocean! After our first morning drinking coffee on the patio we opted to walk down and enjoy the sunrises there on the water and what a view! With the cooler evening weather we got to enjoy the fireplace in the evening and it created the perfect ambiance! Loved that there was a walking path and we were so close to Lovers Point Park too! We had restaurants, cafes, shopping all within a 15/20 min walk. This home is very convenient for anyone who is visiting Monterey or Carmel By The Sea too."
12053553,221798806,2017-12-27,145319639,Ganci,"Such a lovely place, with a garden of sea view.  Great interior design.  One block away from coastline. 
What else I need to say?"
12053553,227698036,2018-01-15,6445907,Adriana,"Beautiful place in a great location in Monterey. Jonathan, the host, was very welcoming and accommodating. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the Monterey area."
12053553,230730737,2018-01-28,166662189,Kathleen,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful cottage. The location is fabulous! Short walk to the ocean.  The garden is absolutely stunning and Jonathon and Adriana were very kind.  Not intrusive at all and yet there if you needed anything. Would definitely return!
12848742,73503815,2016-05-08,18067665,"Jim,Stacey,Gary,Lynea,Amy,&Michael","What a wonderful weekend we spent at Michael's adorable cottage! We absolutely loved the charm and decor. It was incredibly quaint and cozy, with all the comforts of home provided for our convenience. We parked our car and walked everywhere — Cannery Row, downtown Pacific Grove, and Lover's Point Beach. The cottage was the perfect place to come back to after a day of exploring. We enjoyed relaxing in the comfortable living room, drinking wine by the fire, and making a home cooked meal in the delightful kitchen. We can't wait to return for another visit! "
12848742,74611704,2016-05-16,61864048,Camille,"We had a fantastic weekend at Michael's cottage! The location is perfect or everything that Monterey and Pacific Grove have to offer. The coastal trail was just down the street and we enjoyed a walk along the ocean bluff every morning. We also loved the convenience of bike and kayak rentals at Lover's Point Beach. The comfortable cottage and quiet neighborhood were much appreciated to return to each night. This beautiful little cottage just felt so much like home from the minute we arrived, that we wished we didn't have to leave. We look forward to our next trip to Le Mistral ... thanks, Michael, for a weekend we won't soon forget!"
12848742,75839775,2016-05-23,33785775,Laetitia,"We had a great time, the cottage is nice and cosy."
12848742,77255187,2016-05-31,4186534,Sonya,"Michael was a great host. The cottage was just as described and everything was perfect for our arrival. Michael was very thoughtful, checking in to make sure everything was going well and we had everything we needed for our stay. The neighborhood was great - close to everything but in a nice, quiet location with lots of parking around. We really enjoyed staying in Pacific Grove where we could wander around the quiet neighborhood but easily get to the more touristy areas of Monterey and Carmel. We look forward to coming back!"
12848742,78768701,2016-06-09,9585085,Natalie,"Michael has thought of everything at his beautiful cottage. His communication throughout the booking process and during the trip were exactly what we needed to feel comfortable and informed. We were sent detailed arrival instructions before we left and there was a very thorough welcome binder at the cottage telling us everything we needed to know, about staying there and enjoying the surrounding area. We had no idea there were so many things to do locally and so many fantastic restaurants to try — which actually created a dilemma because we hated to leave this adorable cottage each morning. Every corner was full of homey charm and thoughtful touches. The fact that it was so incredibly relaxing and tranquil, made us anticipate our return at the end of each day.  

We will never forget the fun we had here and the simple pleasures like enjoying the fresh ocean breezes blow through the cottage windows. We really couldn't have asked for any place more perfect to stay on our trip to the coast. "
12848742,79208562,2016-06-11,7512252,Tom,"We really enjoyed our time in Pacific Grove.  Our accommodations was very nice and my family enjoyed the walkable proximity to the downtown, etc.  We certainly would recommend."
12848742,79948090,2016-06-15,45030170,James,"We loved staying at this property.  The cottage was gorgeous and every bit as appealing as in the photos.  Michael was a terrific host and even met us on arrival.  He had prepared a little outside fire for us to sit by.

The cottage is a fair walk from the beach and the village but the neighbourhood is lovely."
12848742,80507729,2016-06-18,76980267,Stephanie,"My friends and I had a fantastic stay at Le Mistral. The neighborhood was very quiet, and Michael was a superb host. "
12848742,81471687,2016-06-23,68171880,Frank,"We had a great time in Le Mistral. Michael was an excellent host. He sent instructions about where things were before our arrival and was even there to meet us when we arrived. Once upstairs, we were greeted by a bottle of wine left to welcome us. The cottage was amazing and was exactly as it was described, love the all the little details that have been put into making Le Mistral so cozy. We also loved the fact that it had great Wi-Fi. The neighborhood was so calm and peaceful and we loved the nice ocean breeze that would fill the cottage when we opened the windows. After spending days in Carmel and Big Sur, returning to Le Mistral was a welcoming treat."
12848742,83132705,2016-07-01,3446660,Adam,"The place is exactly like the pictures. We guess the one of the host must be an artist! The host provided so many nice things for us to use, including a bottle of local wine. The communication was fast and smooth. The location of the place is great. We didn't walk down the hill, but we can drive to everywhere within 5 minutes. Driving down to the south towards Big Sur was an amazing experience. We stayed an extra day to enjoy more. "
12848742,84143957,2016-07-05,5350930,Solveig,"Great communication with Michael before our check-in into his very nice cottage which I truly recommend: close from the beach and Monterey as well as from Carmel, very very very cosy. A true hotel you can stay in for a while since it has everything you need for a great stay: towels, soap, kitchen... Thanks!"
12848742,85770727,2016-07-13,77985165,Jim,Michael has a beautifully decorated country style cottage in a great location.  Most comfy beds ever. Loved the sheets and comforters.  Perfect location in a quiet neighborhood. I would 100 percent recommend this as a place to stay.  
12848742,88039700,2016-07-23,28725979,Suzanne,"Such a lovely cottage. Adorable decor, fabulous beds, wonderful ocean breeze, quiet neighborhood, walking distance to town, many special touches and a bottle of wine to greet us. Could not ask for any place better. Michael and Amy were sweet and easy to communicate with. I shall return! "

12848742,91473602,2016-08-05,81353206,Halimah,"We had a lovely stay at Le Mistral with one of our grown daughters and an 11 year old grandchild. The actual apartment is as charming as the photos, so we enjoyed hanging out whenever we were there, reading around the cozy Franklin fireplace as well cooking cheese omelets in the well equipped  kitchen. Since we were first time Airbnb users, we had some questions.  Michael and Amy were very helpful answering our emails and text messages. From the bottle of wine and a welcome note to their guest binder with great restaurant recommendations, we felt well cared for.  We biked, walked, swam, and kayaked during our visit. The shops of Pacific Grove were a convenient short drive to this peaceful neighborhood. Glad we chose Le Mistral! Thanks Michael and Amy."
12848742,92666008,2016-08-09,16385532,Carla,The Cottage was really nice and in a very good location. Ver cute place to stay! And the communication with Michael was very easy! We will defiantly recommend it!!

Michael was very helpful and responded quickly to any questions. We highly recommend this property."

12848742,95318018,2016-08-19,35652523,Huong,"We loved La Mistral! It was the cosiest little cottage in ideal location, with everything we needed and some! 
Super clear access instructions made everything really easy for us.

It was perfect for my young family, the aquarium and the heated pool by lovers point were favourites and only minutes away in the car!

The decor, the fireplace, the coffee and welcome wine were all such nice little touches and were really appreciated. 

Thanks so much to Michael and Amy for hosting us and making our first Airbnb experience amazing! "
12848742,97246301,2016-08-26,31599344,Joe,We had a great stay at Michael's place in Pacific Grove! Michael's instructions on how to access the place were very straightforward. The home was lovely and exactly what we needed for our time in Pacific Grove. All rooms were very clean and comfortable. Everything in the area is within walking distance or a short bike ride. Would definitely stay here again!
12848742,98139847,2016-08-29,28457590,Carrie,"Excellent host, house was just as described, very clean, well appointed, and beds were very comfortable. I couldn't have asked for more."
12848742,101103572,2016-09-11,73408159,Aram,Great cozy place to stay. I highly recommend it. 
12848742,101612483,2016-09-14,3285024,Gloria,"Michael was really helpful when we arrived. During our stay, we accidentally turned off the gas for the fireplace and he send us some electrical heaters right away. The place was beautiful and nice. I loved every peace of it. The small town Pacific Grove is a beautiful place. Michael have a folder of information about the restaurant and other things to do when you stay there."
12848742,102523524,2016-09-18,76887507,Liam,"We had a wonderful time at Quaint Coastal Cottage. The place feels like home as soon as you walk in.  It is clean with everything you would need. Michael was available throughout our stay to help with several queiries we had. Pacific Grove is a beautiful part of the world with wild deer walking along the streets.The cottage is only several blocks from the sea, main high street and Cannery Row. I would definitely recommend staying here."
12848742,102947369,2016-09-19,4296437,Jane,Micheals cottage was perfect. It was spotless... Beautifully decorated and very comfortable. 
12848742,103535149,2016-09-23,79328452,Shastl,"This is a lovely cottage, in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood.  We enjoyed the attention to detail in the decor; so many delightful touches! We felt very comfortable and relaxed in the space.   Michael was very responsive and helpful with any questions or requests.  The only thing that would make the space even better would be a wood-like floor, similar to the kitchen, instead of the carpet.  
"
12848742,104204341,2016-09-25,30298544,Megan,Michael was great! We arrived a little early and was having issue with the door but he helped us to be able to get in the house. The place is cute and in a great area. The beds are really comfy!! 
12848742,105300176,2016-10-01,1385883,William,"They left a cute note with a bottle of wine as a welcoming.  They were very easy to communicate with.  We got there early and, after a brief text back and forth, they were able to let us check in early."
12848742,105994683,2016-10-03,9287018,Lin,"Michael's place is one of best Airbnb that I've ever stayed. It's very clean, neat and organized. Everything is curated artfully and he has good taste on arts and accessories. Me and my family had a very pleasant stay there. We feel calm and settled soon as we arrived. The location is very close to the Aquarium, and we walked around the nice neighborhood too. I definitely recommend this place! "
12848742,107350151,2016-10-10,21145886,Stacy,This Cottage was more spacious than expected from pictures and had everything we needed! We especially loved the gas fireplace at night and cute decorations throughout the place.  It has every amenity anyone would need and very well stocked. So clean and beds were very comfortable. We chose to stay here because affordable for space you get and location was wonderful. We traveled to Big Sur and Carmel from this location easily.  I would definitely stay here again! 
12848742,110206017,2016-10-24,85307932,David,Fantastic hosts! Beautiful area and a great location. We loved walking to downtown and along the bay to watch the seals. Thanks for a great stay!
12848742,112177940,2016-11-04,51489124,Ariel,Lovely cottage. Great decorations and host is very responsive. I saw two deer 9pm just near the corner of the house. Such a lovely surprise!! 
12848742,113402209,2016-11-12,62695256,Cindy,From the first email interaction I knew this was going to be the peaceful getaway that I wanted. I've never had a smoother Air B&B experience. 
12848742,115204633,2016-11-22,6706956,Vanessa,"This was a particularly good airbnb experience, just the right size for our family of 3, would be nice for 2 couples as well.  An easy and beautiful walk to the aquarium, good restaurants nearby, quiet and clean with a cozy gas fireplace. Beds were nice memory foam."
12848742,117087732,2016-12-04,1925643,Alison,"Michael's lovely cottage was one of my favorite Airbnb experiences, and I've been using the site since 2012! It has one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on that is not my own, and between the warm French country decor, roaring (gas) fire, cozy living room and well-equipped kitchen, we felt right at home... but were really just a few short blocks to the main drag of quaint Pacific Grove and the ocean! We were visiting close friends who moved to the area recently, but because we had our 18-month-old daughter with us, they ended up coming to ""our place"" during the evenings. (Note: the cottage is on the second floor, so if you bring a young one, you'll probably want a baby gate for the top of the stairs). Really, we couldn't ask for a better option for our too-short stay in the area. Thanks, Michael!"
12848742,120328391,2016-12-09,43037379,Jeanne,The place looks exactly like the photos. The beds are really comfortable and we were walkable to everything. Michael was easy to communicate with and very responsive. The guidebook is fillled with recommendations for things to do and resturants. Crema is the best breakfast ever! I would highly recommend this place.
12848742,122172724,2016-12-21,98838023,Yck (Phone number hidden by Airbnb),"房子很干净。有一个厨房很方便。住户生活与户主是分开的所以不会被打扰。周围风景很好,离市中心也不远。"
12848742,122944762,2016-12-26,60417639,Xiaoliang,Very nice place. The house is a bit old but quite convenient. My only suggestion is that it will be great if the heater (gas fireplace) can automatically turn on and off according to room temperature. We have a 1yr old baby who slept in the living room. Keeping the fireplace on is too hot but turn it off is a bit too (Website hidden by Airbnb) we had to manually turn it on and off a few times during the night. For adults there is no problem because the comforter is very warm and we are ok without heating at night.
12848742,128796945,2017-01-27,52551841,Kate,"We loved Michael's place! Great location in Pacific Grove--near the water as well as the small main drag. We were two couples (close friends) and it was perfect for us for two nights, however, it's small and cozy so it doesn't offer a ton of privacy. We found the kitchen to be very charming and pretty well appointed. As many of the other reviewers mentioned, the beds are ridiculously comfortable! We'd happily return here!"
12848742,131610591,2017-02-12,46000909,Ali,"Michael's place is quaint, charming and perfectly located in Pacific Grove. It was such an easy walk (or drive) to get to the downtown area, beach and attractions. It was also a short drive away from Pebble Beach and the 17 Mile Drive that takes you into Carmel. The listing was clean, neatly decorated with California cottage style. The amenities were great, and Michael was so easy to communicate with. Would absolutely recommend for a weekend in the Monterey area!"
12848742,134331677,2017-02-26,45770749,Whitney,This place is in such a great location close to everything! Most comfortable beds I've slept in staying at an air bnb. Hope to come back and stay again soon!! 
12848742,138661620,2017-03-20,6645027,Sabina,"My family had an amazing time during our 3-night stay at Michael's & Amy's upstairs rental. In addition to the little nearby aquarium that you may have heard of, there are some nice playgrounds that my 3 yr-old daughter had a great time walking to and stomping around. The location is great and the layout of the interior is well thought out. Both bedrooms are on the south side and the kitchen and living room are on the north with a closet and bathroom separating the spaces. We were able to tuck the kids in early and watch a movie in the living room without any worry of disturbing them. My only regret is not staying longer and we'll be looking forward to the next visit."
12848742,139887715,2017-03-26,10636820,Matthew,"Excellent place - exactly as described and perfect for a short trip to the area.

Thanks!!"
12848742,140976824,2017-04-01,96093,Karen,Great cottage. Very quaint and furnished lovely. Perfect for our family of 4. 
12848742,142944777,2017-04-09,5626868,Sara,"This is a lovely, cozy, magical little place in a quiet neighborhood at the top of a hill. An easy walk or bike to the Aquarium, Cannery Row, and the cute shops of Pacific Grove. Walking/biking back up is a little intense, but that was fine with us. 

Michael and Amy are wonderful and responsive hosts who did everything they could to make sure we were comfortable. They went out of their way to help us safely store our bikes, and handled my multiple neurotic emails and questions with grace and kindness. 

We will absolutely stay here again - it was the perfect home base for enjoying Monterey. Thanks guys!"
12848742,144101321,2017-04-14,71407429,Celia,"Cute little cottage, prints and posters of good taste adorn the walls, comfortable beds, convenient location, welcoming hosts. House details slightly old and basic, but still feels warm and cozy. Enjoy the comfy experience overall, but I wouldn't overly romanticize about the ""French country"" aspect of it."
12848742,149128157,2017-05-02,4612371,Heidi,"Le Mistral is a adorable place to stay! We had everything we needed for a comfortable 5-night stay to run the Big Sur Marathon. Great location in charming Pacific Grove - away from the bustle of Monterey but easy to get to the bakery, or beach, and marathon expo/events.  So nice to have a kitchen to cook some meals although we did enjoy the numerous delicious restaurants in the area (be sure to go to Passionfish!) we did run into Michael and he was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. When it was chilly the gas fireplace and blankets were so nice, but mostly we enjoyed the lovely breezes that come through the open windows during the day. The neighborhood is very quiet at night and the bed sucked me in post-marathon and I slept like a dream. Would definitely stay again! "

12848742,154441524,2017-05-24,39903687,John,We had a lovely stay in Monterey and Michael and Amy's place was ideally situated. It was also just as we expected having read the description. If I was returned to the area I would happily stay there again.
12848742,156086122,2017-05-29,91832987,Dana,"My fiance and I arrived at Le Mistral for a wedding in Monterrey after traveling for a week up the Pacific Coast Highway on a road trip. This was the perfect place after an exhausting road trip because the cottage was super relaxing, cozy, and comfortable! We shared the cottage with another couple and it seemed to be the perfect size for four adults-- although we thought having just one bathroom might be a challenge for two couples, it didn't end up being a problem after all :) 

We stayed at the cottage for two days and two nights. The cottage is located in a fantastic location, about 10-15 minutes from both Carmel-by-the-Sea and Pebble Beach. It was also less than 10 minutes from the Monterrey Aquarium, Cannery Row, and plenty of restaurants, shops, and antique stores. We had brunch at two awesome restaurants - Wave Street Cafe and Crema - highly recommend!

The inside of the cottage is impeccably clean and cozy. We felt at home and at ease as soon we arrived. Amy and Michael did an excellent job at making the cottage feel cozy, quaint, and charming. I especially appreciated the little details like the placement of art, books, and quirky antiques. Not to mention, the beds were incredibly plush and comfortable too! Amy and Michael were very accessible and easy in terms of communication throughout the process, and their sense of warmth and hospitality was certainly present throughout our stay. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful escape in beautiful Monterrey - you will be very well taken care of!"
12848742,159292045,2017-06-10,17648691,Sarah,"This bright and airy cottage is located just a few blocks from the beautiful Pacific ocean, as well as from lovely restaurants, coffee shops, and the amazing biking/walking path that makes moving by foot between Pacific Grove and Monterey easy and incredibly enjoyable. We loved opening the cottage windows in the afternoon to feel the sea breeze and then firing up the gas stove/fireplace at night while we played card games. The kitchen is great for making a simple meal, with all the basic tools provided. The neighborhood is quite and peaceful, and we felt quite at home in Le Mistral. Lastly, Amy and Michael were quick to respond to any questions/needs we had."
12848742,160377121,2017-06-13,14013764,Jayme,"Michal and Amy's place was lovely. Quiet, cozy and extremely comfortable beds. "

12848742,168969224,2017-07-10,56207892,Collette,Michael & Amy's place was absolutely adorable. We were in town for World Superbike so we didn't spend much time on the property but the time we did spend there was perfect. The neighborhood is positively magical. 
12848742,169797512,2017-07-13,137519309,Valida,"Thank you Michael & Amy, for sharing Le Mistral with us!  We had a wonderful stay.  My youngest (11) liked to call it an ""old-timey"" house.  It was very comfortable--especially the beds.  I wish we had been able to spend more time there, maybe we'll return when my girls are older.  They really loved the area, and the house.  Thanks again!"
12848742,171477135,2017-07-17,85995270,Jo,"We loved Michael & Amy's place.   We are four adults and were quite comfortable in the upstairs cottage.  We like to cook more than eat out - the  kitchen, besides being adorable, had everything we needed.  Pacific Grove is breathtaking.  I regret we could not stay longer."

12848742,184940648,2017-08-20,9127848,Debbie,"Charming little 2 bdrm for short stay.  We had the upstairs property, which was quaint.  Roof is a-frame which means ducking your head a bit when in the bedrooms and kitchen.  We aren't talk so not a big deal.  We could not connect to wifi, even though owner attempted to fix.  Overall, I think we would stay again.  Attentive and very nice owners 👍😊"
12848742,187856149,2017-08-27,112424650,Tilo,"Ein wunderbar gelegenes Haus, liebevoll eingerichtet und nah bei Restaurants und allen Sehenswürdigkeiten."
12848742,193494969,2017-09-13,48518139,Emily,"The apartment is just as cute and cozy as the pictures!  Very clean and lovely space.  You should know that the neighbors have organized against short term rentals (STR) in the area.  Signs are posted at all the neighboring houses.  If you park in front of other houses they will likely ask you to move (in my case, without a lot of kindness...)."
12848742,195280523,2017-09-18,61176030,Jackson,"We have a great time in Monterey at Michael and Amy's place! It is beautiful, exactly as it looks in photos. Michael and Amy were always super prompt in their communication and helped us out through the booking and check-in process, plus recommended some great places to eat in Monterey! We brought our parents to stay at the cottage and really appreciated all the small details of how nice it is and how nice Michael and Amy are. The cottage is a 10 minute walk to pacific grove down town and a nice walk/ running track along the water. Really relaxing and enjoyable place to visit. 

Highly recommend and we would love to come back! Thanks again"
12848742,197207520,2017-09-24,38955198,Nonie,"The cottage is extremely clean, well decorated and very comfortable. I wish it could be my house! The area is perfect - an easy walk down to the ocean for amazing views. I would definitely recommend this place!"

12848742,207746288,2017-10-29,8915980,Tim,Great two-bedroom in a quiet neighborhood a short walk from Cannery Row and the other main sites in Monterrey.  Easy communication with the hosts and very easy check-in/out.  Would recommend to anyone and would be happy to return.
12848742,213895023,2017-11-23,91897739,Vern,"We really enjoyed our stay.  We were extremely pleased with the restaurant suggestions in the binder on the coffee table.  The facilities were clean, comfortable, quiet and wonderfully relaxing - walks to the beach and downtown Pacific Grove, invigorating."
12848742,214857575,2017-11-26,50065164,Bob,"This is a great location and incredible value. We parked our car and were walking distance to just about everything. Loved just being able to walk down to the water and to restaurants on Lighthouse Avenue with ease. Groceries are not all that close - so stock up before you park. There aren't many stock items in the kitchen so you could hit the Safeway or Grove Market on the way in. Lovely neighborhood - it really felt like home. :) The wifi was really strong and capable of withstanding several phones hooked in at a time. It was very charming and I would absolutely rent there again. 

I was little shocked to get hit with a Pacific Grove Short Term Rental charge on top of what they are already renting for - and wasn't alerted to it till after the rental had already been paid for. $60 on top of $366 may not seem like lots of money - but felt a little like an afterthought."
12848742,220119304,2017-12-20,68267103,Amber,"Michael and Amy were fantastic hosts - Amy was so helpful and responsive, and the space is absolutely adorable, clean and comfortable. It was perfect for our family of four."

12848742,227691835,2018-01-15,76613142,Melissa,Our family of four had a wonderful time here! The house is very old and a bit creaky but added to the charm. Thanks for the stay!
12848742,230043933,2018-01-26,11707371,Laura,"I enjoyed staying here with my husband, baby, and mother-in-law while on a work trip.  The local area is beautiful, and the rental is within reasonable walking distance of a number of cafes and shops.  The home itself is well-appointed, cozy, and comfortable, and we enjoyed the cottage decor.  The gas fireplace is a lovely feature.  Michael and Amy were easy to communicate with and replied quickly to my various inquiries.  Would stay here again!"

It was perfect for our group of 4 — Michael and Amy provide all the little amenities that add up to make a big difference, and they are friendly and communicative hosts. We are so glad we stayed at Le Mistral, and would definitely book it again in the future!"
12848742,246599805,2018-03-25,7071233,Lisa,Thank you so much for such a wonderful weekend away! Le Mistral is so chic; we were thoroughly impressed by the decor and found the space in general to be homey and charming. The beds were INSANELY comfortable. Location was awesome and convenient. Michael and Amy were FANTASTIC with communication. Would definitely stay here again!
12848742,247474633,2018-03-28,6310016,Jennifer,"Nicely appointed space, super clean and bright. Very comfortable beds and well equipped kitchen. Easy walk down to waterfront, aquarium & easy check in. Missed that it didn't have an outdoor area for upstairs guests. However if you are a day tripping family, gone most of the day exploring, this unit is perfect for you. 

Just a note on the neighborhood as I'm surprised no other guests put in their review.  It's apparent that the neighbors do not appreciate having a STR beside them given all the Stop STR protest signs on every house surrounding the rental and directly facing the property. We found it a little unsettling to pull up and know your presence wasn't welcome. I'm not up to speed on the issues that face the neighborhood with rentals - just an FYI to other renters. I hope everyone is able to resolve the issue somehow."

12848742,254461574,2018-04-16,2850379,Peter,Monterey and the surrounding area is wonderful and our stay was much enhanced by Michael and Amy's wonderful cottage. It's location is ideal for walking to Cannery Row or the splendours of Lovers Point. Everything you need for a great weekend.
13261592,81431808,2016-06-23,21106108,Shrishail,"We have been doing AirBnB and (Hidden by Airbnb) for a few years. Our experience with Amy's home ranks among the best!

After a week, our 6-year old continues to talk about the fun she had in Amy's back yard, picking eggs from the chicken pen, about learning to play Doe-a-Dear on the Piano, reading the wonderful children's books, soaking in the deep tub.

Amy's has decorated her house tastefully, yet practically, so we found everything we needed and yet, the house did not seem cluttered with stuff. We got the feeling that everything here belongs!

We would love to return to Amy's in the future.  Thank you Amy!
"
13261592,82545131,2016-06-28,14174289,Dmitry,"Charming house built with so much love to kids. The backyard has a playground, cool swings and a table tennis. On a back-backyard there are chickens that my daughter loved to watch and feed - we even got 4 eggs for breakfast. The house is full of toys and !music instruments, there are 2 small guitars, piano, flutes, djembe, etc. We enjoyed played on all these together with kids.
The place is real close to the ocean, asilomar beach is 10 minutes (or something) away. Right across the street there is a park but we haven't even get there because of such an awesome backyard.
We've had an awesome weekend and we recommend everyone to stay here, your kids will thank you for it."
13261592,88594368,2016-07-24,45026024,Jessica,"We had a wonderful time at this home.  Location was great, close to the beach and cannery row.  The home was a perfect place for our young family.  My kids loved the backyard and toys.  Hosts were quick to respond with any questions.  Highly recommend for families. Thank you for a great time!"
13261592,96194361,2016-08-22,83750442,Kevin,"Amy was so great about communicating with us before the trip, giving us all the information we needed to know in a timely manner and even checking in with us to make sure we arrived without any problems.

The house itself was as wonderful as advertised and it's perfect for families with young kids!"
13261592,108249504,2016-10-15,13777098,Megan,"Lovely home perfect for families! Our children loved the backyard!  Chickens, tree swing, play structure what more could you ask for.  Inside, everywhere they turned was something to entertain them, they especially loved the piano and musical instruments.  We are a family that's likes TV in the evenings but we didn't turn it on once during our stay!  All in all I definitely recommend this home for families with small children.  "
13261592,141359023,2017-04-02,12272287,Darrell,Great home in an amazing neighborhood.  Perfect for a family with children with a large backyard.

13428610,87067225,2016-07-18,82683327,Laurie,"We were greeted at the door, given all the information needed to have a great stay.  Everything was beautiful and the view is SPECTACULAR from the bedroom! We recommend bringing binoculars to see the whales and sea otters, we had ours and it greatly increased our enjoyment of the breathtaking coastal wildlife.  King sized adjustable bed was very comfortable and everything was clean.  Spa shower set up is big enough for two! Very quiet, serene, private and definitely romantic.  Enjoyed a day at the aquarium with free passes from our hosts, get there early for members entry to avoid the crowds.  Easy walk to the beach, we enjoyed walking the neighborhood too.  Lots of good restaurants around but make reservations early on weekends. The brownies left for us were yummy and good coffee and other amenities available. Couldn't have asked for anything more, all was perfect!"
13428610,99672357,2016-09-05,90633569,Nitya,Jeanne and her husband were extremely helpful and thoughtful. Very friendly. Extremely beautiful place. Loved and enjoyed the stay. The views are very beautiful. The suite itself has a very awesome set up.
13428610,102629796,2016-09-18,33574109,Eric,Absolutely beautiful location.  You won't find a hotel with a better view and fully featured room.  The views in the morning were spectacular.  Very quiet neighborhood with walking paths all around.  The hosts were very very helpful and welcoming.  They created an atmosphere of calm for us while we stayed.  Very private room with easy access.  Absolutely recommended!
13428610,107240541,2016-10-09,97508544,Michael,Where do I start?  The property was perfect and breathtaking at every turn!  Jeanne and Dale were incredible hosts who were extremely thoughtful.  My wife and I wanted to explore Pacific Grove and we could not have asked for a better location to see it for all of its beauty.  The ocean views are spectacular!  We will definitely be back.
13428610,131597264,2017-02-12,36811225,Jason,"The location of this house is amazing (only two houses from the water) and the view of the bay from the room is breathtaking! We even woke to whales spouting out in the bay that we could see from our room through those big beautiful windows. You can walk to town, although it is pretty far (about 2 miles), so we opted to drive or take a lyft/uber. We did walk along the water each day and down towards the lighthouse, watching the otters, seals and many birds along the way.  Jeanne and Dale are such nice people. They shared all of their top restaurant choices with us and gave us a lot of information about Monterey and the surrounding areas. Jeanne even gave us a ride into town and pointed out some of the places they had told us about! Monterey is great, but this place is so nice and tranquil, you might not want to go anywhere. This is an amazing place, with amazing hosts. We highly recommend it!"
13428610,148482133,2017-04-30,127247411,David,OMG! What a great place to stay in the Monterey/Pacific Grove area. House was the second house from Monterey Bay. Easy access to the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail for biking or walking. View from the second floor master suite was terrific. Large bay window was perfect for watching the pod of whales glide by on Sunday morning. Can't wait to come again. 
13428610,158456681,2017-06-06,84341608,Janet,"Fantastic location. I stayed 6 nights and never tired of the walks and bike rides from the front door. The wildlife was quite abundant--deer and squirrels on land and sea otters, dolphins and seals in the nearby ocean. I saw humpback whales on one of the commercial trips. The nearby town of Pacific Grove was an easy walk and had a market, coffee cafe and good bakery. Jeanne and Dale were great hosts."
13428610,160136922,2017-06-12,2980736,Lisa,"This place is spectacular. The pictures and description were spot on. The view from the bedroom was amazing. Jeanne emailed the day before to ask what I like to drink in the morning as well as at night.  This was a nice touch.  The refrigerator was well stocked with those items. Jeanne and Dale met me at check-in and offered tips on local eateries, activities and made sure I had everything I needed. They communicated well, were friendly and very respectful of privacy and noise. My itinerary was full so I did not see them again after I checked in. I would return in a heart beat. This is a beautiful room, yard and home. You won't want to leave. Thank you Jeanne and Dale. "
13428610,179084464,2017-08-06,68322304,Mike,"We had a great time here
Hosts were very helpful, friendly and accommodating.  Check in and check out were easy.  Property has a beautiful view of the ocean
It is half an hour walk along the beach to cannery row in Monterey and 20 min away from Pacific Grove downtown 
Very relaxing "
13428610,190711885,2017-09-04,142524333,Daisie,Jeanne was so helpful and the property is just wonderful.  Beautifully decorated and clean.  The view was just incredible.  We walked down to the bench by the bay and watched the sunrise but could have enjoyed it just as much without even getting out of bed.  The walk to downtown PG is a very nice one.  Excellent location and neighborhood.  We loved out stay!
13490440,84654063,2016-07-08,75814257,Marlon,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13490440,107676807,2016-10-11,96987173,Gerald,Cottage was clean with updated and quaint decorations.  Many comfy touch especially like smores kit coffee soft pillows and linens and throw s.
13490440,143430568,2017-04-11,74098421,David,"The house was great!  I visisted the area with my wife and three small children. There was plenty of room for all of us, and the location couldn't be beat. The house had lots of kids toys, and they loved the bunk beds. Being two blocks from Lighthouse Ave meant everything was walkable in PG. (Must drive to Monterey or Carmel).

I highly recommend this house for future stays. "
13490440,150399319,2017-05-07,35496450,Sonya,"Shirleen was a wonderful host! The house is darling and beautifully furnished. It allowed my family to gather comfortably and spend quality time together. The location could not be better; it's close to lots of shopping and restaurants. I jogged along the beach, and it was glorious. I highly recommend Shirleen's home! "
13490440,158413345,2017-06-06,124139280,Jennifer,"Cottage adorable, cozy and comfortable. Beds really comfortable!  Perfect size for 6 of us, including our four children, ages 7-20. Great location to walk to Pacific Grove each morning for coffee; short walk to Lovers Point. Mile walk to Aquarium/cannery row. Only minor note is that kitchen was inconsistently stocked (no colander, pots with fitting lids, baking dish, etc, yet lots of condiments, spices etc. )but  we improvised and cooked two dinners.  Other  than that: fantastic! Highly recommend. "
13490440,165687710,2017-07-01,45489825,Li,"房间干净,生活方便。房主也很好沟通。唯一就是主卧窗子多有点亮"
13490440,185397087,2017-08-21,26947179,Jeff,Great location with good restaurants at the end of the street walking distance I will book again !!
13490440,214854931,2017-11-26,24494318,Sherri,The location was really great because it was a short walk to downtown Pacific Grove and Lover's Point. The Monterrey Aquarium and Cannery Row were about a mile so we walked down one of the days and drove on another.  There is plenty to do in the area so it was great.  The house was stocked with all of the kitchen supplies that we needed and we made several meals at the house.
13490440,221498052,2017-12-26,9952561,Grace,"很温馨,非常不错的体验。"
13490440,223706831,2018-01-01,9839969,Mercy,Shirleen's place was ADORABLE and very comfortable. My family loved it. We came during the winter but I can see how the house would be PERFECT for a summer beach vacation.
13710512,91471712,2016-08-05,22533176,Sibila,"Accurate listing description and wonderful neighborhood, but was was TOP NOTCH were the hosts Kelly and Ken! If you make a wish for the perfect hosts they will surely appear right in front of you! Kelly and Ken go way beyond possible to make you feel comfortable and at home. We were greeted by them like we were old friends and we felt honored to have them spend their time navigating us through the details of the city. They left us a variety of goodies to snack on and a great wine bottle! The place is SUPER cozy and delightful to stay in. I would definitely come back! Thank you Kelly and Ken for being such wonderful hosts!!"
13710512,93132826,2016-08-11,87399807,Mira,"We were a group of four and it was a very comfortable space. The place was clean and easy to get to. The location is great, close to all the main attractions. Our hosts were very helpful and quick to respond to questions. They provided coffee (very good coffee), tea, snacks, and even wine! They also had a great selection of movies. The beds were amazingly comfortable and they have plenty of warm fluffy blankets and pillows; We were never cold during the night.
We have no complaints, the experience exceeded our expectations. "
13710512,93801928,2016-08-14,4350836,Svea Lin,"This is the second unit of a low-key beach town duplex. The building had some wear, but the space was perfectly comfortable and clean and had more amenities than we were expecting. Our son loved the cozy space, climbable furniture, and day bed, where he slept. Windows had coverings that kept it nice and dim in the evenings/mornings. We were plenty warm and, although the host mentioned we may hear noise in the morning, it was very quiet as well. It was a perfect space for our short stay!"
13710512,94886229,2016-08-17,87143059,Stephen,"They were very welcoming! We arrived later in the evening and they were at a benefit at the Monterey Aquariam. As soon as she arrived home, she shot over and gave us a quick tour of the place. It was a great experience overall."
13710512,95391179,2016-08-19,75629145,Jonathan,"Ken greeted us and showed us around the space. It was late when we arrived. Kelly and Ken have really went above and beyond making sure everything is available here! My wife especially loved all the nice touches- the super comfy bed and blankets. They took extra care to make it feel like home.

The aquarium was fun and quite walkable from their place.

This was a great airbnb experience and I completely recommend them to everyone!"
13710512,99695737,2016-09-05,84668539,Jim,"The hosts are some of the sweetest people I've ever met. They were very helpful during our stay, offering passes to the aquarium and excellent dinner recommendations. We had a lovely time, in no small part thanks to their hospitality."

It is such a beautiful and homey lil place. It has a very cozy bed and so many comfy blankets all over. The bathroom is fully stocked and they even hooked us up with stuff in the fridge and the aquarium passes! We would absolutely stay again. We wanted to stay longer, but we couldn't. Definitely happy with our getaway. Also, they were so sweet trying to help us with check in times and if you just communicate they're really sweet and willing to help! "
13710512,101205757,2016-09-12,10956352,Stephen,"Loved the place, very walkable, quiet neighborhood, spacious apartment, save a ton by using their aquarium guest passes! Great living room and bedroom for relaxing, nice well stocked kitchen for cooking. Definitely recommend!"
13710512,101858471,2016-09-15,71453553,Jessica,"This was the nicest Airbnb experience we've had to date. The bed was SO comfortable, there were delicious things to eat and drink, Kelly and Ken even left books, movies, and stuffed animals for my kids to play with. The aquarium guest passes were such a nice perk and saved us well over $100. We highly, highly recommend. "

You can walk to the Aquarium if you like. Kelly and her husband were very accommodating and super friendly without being at all intrusive, and the place is stocked with everything you need. Kelly takes great pains to think of even the smallest things to make the stay comfortable. Highly recommended."

Kelly and Ken made sure we knew where things were in the house and in the neighborhood. Everything was there to make our stay comfortable and convenient. We would definitely stay with them again. 
13710512,106181736,2016-10-04,33873815,Kim,My husband and I spent 2 nights at this house when we went for golf around the bay areas.  Ken greeted us upon our arrival to the house.  He was so nice and showed us around the house and let us know where all the things were kept.  There are extra blankets if you are cold and a fan just in case is too warm for you. The kitchen was well stocked with food.  The host bought us croissant and muffins for our breakfast.  Which was great as we leaves early for golf.  The house was very clean and spacious.  The only regret we have was not able to sleep in and enjoyed the comfy bed.  We checked out around 7.45am and Ken dropped by to say goodbye.  This is one of our best experience with Airbnb and I would highly recommend this place.    
13710512,106707107,2016-10-07,91016012,Heather,"Kelly and her husband greeted us when we arrived and gave us the grand tour of the apartment. She really takes her role as host seriously and was warm and accommodating to our needs. She quickly produced a tube of super glue for a minor repair I needed and I felt confident that if I needed anything else, I could go to them for questions or help. We had a great stay and enjoyed the air pop popcorn maker... Nice touch! Just a short walk to the aquarium and the guest passes they offered were a deciding factor for our stay. "
13710512,109636252,2016-10-22,83819310,Scott,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed an absolutely wonderful getaway here.  Ken and Kelly were welcoming, cheerful, and helpful.  The apartment was clean, beautifully furnished, and located within walking distance of Cannery Row and the water.  And the cherry on top?  Their charming cat who greeted us in the morning!  We will definitely stay here again next time we are in the area."
13710512,110206077,2016-10-24,46001886,Jason,We had a warm welcome and felt very comfortable. We would stay here again.
13710512,110640489,2016-10-27,16995100,Jai,"We had such a great experience here and loved the apartment. It was very clean, inviting, fun and comfortable. I did refer to it as home a few times to my husband. We really enjoyed the aquarium passes and we're able to walk there with ease. We also put the full kitchen to use! Looking forward to coming back soon."
13710512,111316709,2016-10-30,66511680,Juliene,Kelly's place was perfect for a weekend in Monterey and Pacific Grove.
13710512,113790823,2016-11-13,52063681,Shira,We had a great experience - thanks for a great weekend!
13710512,115211069,2016-11-22,91043936,Anthony,My cousin and I needed a place to post up while we explored all the great hikes that the Big Sur area has to offer. Kelly's place was perfect and she even left some wine and baked goods to welcome us. Definitely recommend and would gladly do it again. 
13710512,117082491,2016-12-04,103934957,Vivia,"Kelly and Ken were very welcoming and their one bedroom apartment is lovely,  thoughtfully decorated and with a very well stocked kitchen. It was a pleasure staying there! "
13710512,120770496,2016-12-11,26000401,Robin,Very comfy and homey!   Very nice!
13710512,126010141,2017-01-08,70592855,Becky,"This place was in a perfect location to get to and from the aquarium and cannery row, easily walkable. Kelly and Ken are extremely welcoming and helpful. Ken gave us lots of good ideas for place eat and visit, along with an extensive tour of the place to make sure we felt at home. Highly recommend this place, we will definitely be coming back again.   "
13710512,127472907,2017-01-18,3496595,Jackie,What a great location and so many extras in the house and kitchen made our stay so welcoming. Robes in the bathroom and fresh pastries from a local bakery on our first morning was amazing. Kelly gave great suggestions for food and local things to do the aquarium passes were also a very big plus. Great trip to Monterey!!  
13710512,129232483,2017-01-29,78699646,Manjula,We had a great stay ! The place is clean and comfortable. Kelly goes the extra mile to make sure we have everything that we need. The communication was great. Check in and check out were very easy.
13710512,130416347,2017-02-05,8355257,Kevin,My young son and I had a wonderful trip here to give Mom a break for the weekend. Kelly's place was just right for us. Close to the aquarium and restaurants. Would definitely recommend. 
13710512,133462622,2017-02-22,39732974,Van,"Although it was a little smaller than expected, this cozy home was perfect for a short family get-away. It had everything from shampoo to extra tooth brushes to condiments in the fridge, plus everything you would need to cook a meal! I hate staying at places that offer a full kitchen but don't even have any salt on hand. It was, hands-down, the most well-stocked airbnb I've stayed in. She even brought over extra candles when the electricity went out (due to one of the worst rain storms the area had seen in over 50 years!). It was also very central to all the local attractions, which were either a short drive or leisurely walk away."
13710512,135641111,2017-03-05,58643450,Chris,"Kelly's place is fantastic if you are planning a trip to the Monterey area. Walking distance from Cannery Row, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and many great restaurants, one of which was recommended by Ken. They provided us all amenities and great hospitality, and have great style for a house rental. Would definitely come back and will recommend to friends!"
13710512,138982962,2017-03-22,54990940,Carla,"There were three of us on our trip to Pacific Grove, including myself and my college-age son and his girlfriend.  This place worked very well for us.  Ken and Kelly have thought of everything to ensure their guests have what they need while traveling...a well-stocked kitchen including a fruit basket and muffins, bath essentials and extras (in case you forgot your toothbrush or shampoo, etc.) and even cozy terry robes.  We were surprised just how comfortable the beds were - even the trundles!  Ken was a gracious host, meeting us at the house for check in and a tour, and giving us great suggestions for which beach to visit, a fabulous Italian restaurant (that served delicious housemade gnocchi and 4 nut pesto) and a little coffee place  nearby where we enjoyed a pour-over roast of the day and fresh baked scones.  We especially loved the central location of the house, as we could walk to everything in 10-20 minutes - the beach, downtown Monterey and Pacific Grove,  and to many shops and restaurants.  An added bonus were the two passes to the acquarium, which we made good use of!  All in all, this place worked perfectly for our 2-night stay."
13710512,140256758,2017-03-28,66257640,Liz,Location is on a quiet street with easy parking. We walked to the aquarium and the 2 aquarium passes are a nice perk. It is a duplex and the hosts live on the other side. Good value for the price. 
13710512,141946058,2017-04-05,118763961,Ryan,Great space with excellent hosts! Walking distance to the aquarium and cannery row! 
13710512,144807292,2017-04-16,77540670,Karen,Nice bathroom and kitchen. Comfortable and Quiet. I would return. 
13710512,145901068,2017-04-20,116626508,Ana,We chose Monterey and the aquarium for our first family vacation. Kelly's place and the aquarium passes were a perfect combo. Kelly was amazingly accommodating and helpful and generous. The house was perfect for us. We had a great time and definitely plan on returning. 
13710512,146760266,2017-04-23,66881487,Sarah,"Great, cozy place with lots of amenities and great location."
13710512,148360673,2017-04-30,43005866,Jill,Kelly was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed. Her place was perfect and we had a wonderful trip. We got to use the Aquarium passes and took our little boy to enjoy the fish. Would definitely stay again!
13710512,150699439,2017-05-08,6415916,Andrew,This place was excellent value. Very comfortable and clean. We definitely reccomend =)
13710512,152266751,2017-05-15,52702226,Mindi,"Where to start???  Amazing place, so convenient to Cannery Row and beautiful short drive to Carmel. We did Hydrobiking at Moss Landing, Segway tour down 17 Mile Drive. We rested and played board games. Very quiet neighborhood. Kelly had the house so well stocked. There was wine, coffee, creamer and more. We also had the most wonderful pastries. Ken made some great restaurant suggestions. We highly recommend and hope to be back!!!"
13710512,153759417,2017-05-21,124424285,Emily,"What a wonderful place to stay while visiting the Monterey area. The cute little home is well appointed with all the little extras provided as if you were staying with family. Kelly had  wine, fruit and fresh ground coffee, as well as waters and juice for us. The little home is quaintly decorated and comfortable in the beautiful area of Pacific Grove. Thank you to the Dirks for such a memorable stay!"
13710512,154649087,2017-05-25,2600228,Danielle,Kelly & Ken's place is quant and centrally located!  It was perfect for our small family and was more accommodating and well stocked then any air b&b we have stayed!!  It is exactly as described and we'd recommend to others.  Thank you Kelly & Ken
13710512,156092903,2017-05-29,7330405,Deb,The location was perfect for visiting the harbor and Aquarium and close to the historic parts of town.  Kelly made everything comfortable and convenient. 
13710512,157404803,2017-06-03,72778630,Freddy,Kelly's adorable apartment was within walking distance to the aquarium(guest passes provided) and Cannery Row. Check in was quick and easy and Kelly did a great job explaining how everything worked in the apartment. The kitchen was stocked with lots of little goodies and all the lights and lamps scattered throughout the house made it very welcoming and fun. We definitely recommend staying with Kelly when visiting Monterey. 
13710512,158463305,2017-06-06,37048083,Lucio,"Kelly was at the front of her house, waiting for us, as we drove in. she welcomed us with a beautiful warm smile. 
Her place was absolutely charming. Kelly! Quickly showed us around. Her apartment is even nicer than the pictures. Kelly made sure we had everything we needed. AND WE DID!! From towels, blankets and robes, to croissants and jam for breakfast, and a bottle of wine for the evening! She had maps at the ready. 
The aquarium was a wonderful treat, we enjoyed it. Monterey is absolutely beautiful. Everything was within walking distance. 
Our only complaint is that we didn't stay longer!!
Will we come back? YES! In a heart beat! Will we recommend Kelly's little treasure, of a place?  OF COURSE!!
Thanks again Kelly. "
13710512,161377749,2017-06-17,126353708,Zachary,"This place is great. We stayed for a couple of days. There are appliances for people to use. In addition, there are extras like wine and coffee provided to add to the experience. 

Highly recommend this place. Felt like we were locals :). "
13710512,163962699,2017-06-25,23042396,Nicole,"This place is great! The little, well-thought-out details really make this place go from great to excellent. (Wifi, extra toiletries for anything you could have forgotten, power strip next to the bed, amazing fluffy blankets. The list goes on.) Check in was easy and well communicated. Kelly and Ken really give you privacy but are right next door if you need anything.  Certainly one of the top Airbnb places I've been to!"
13710512,165041890,2017-06-30,50152568,Kajsa,"Kelly's house was the perfect mix of quiet seclusion and yet walking distance to so much.  My son (10yrs old) and I stayed there on a 4 day trip to Monterey.  It was a cozy little duplex on a quiet street.  Plenty big enough for the two of us...I'd say perfect for either a couple, or a family with one kid.  We were a short 10 minute walk from the Aquarium and Cannery Row, but also centrally located to get to highway 1, the lighthouse and Moss Landing/Elkhorn Slough within a short drive.  Our trip was extremely active so after very busy, physical days we were able to stop by the local grocery store (also walking distance) and cook dinner back ""home"".  Everything from the incredibly luxe and sink-your-body bed coverings to the well thought out kitchen ...and SUPER kind that she stocked with some essentials like juice and water and milk and fruit...also she bought breakfast pastries from a local bakery for our first night's stay.  It was easy to feel at home there and Kelly and her family were very welcoming and comfortable.  We had an amazing trip and would definitely stay here again on our next.  Thanks Kelly!!!"
13710512,166518526,2017-07-03,86005835,Steven,Kelly was very kind and friendly. Great central location. We enjoyed our stay.
13710512,167739928,2017-07-07,124899043,MariaA,"Comfortable, clean, great hosts, residential area.  "
13710512,168878732,2017-07-10,20857266,Andrew,"The apartment was exactly as described. Very close to the aquarium and parking was a breeze. The place was very clean and more than enough space for 2 people. They provided all the essentials including any supplies we may have forgotten. Overall, an excellent place and I'd highly recommend!"
13710512,171101032,2017-07-16,81431893,Rachel,"Kelly's home was perfect for our family vacation. Everything we needed was there in case we forgot something. The full kitchen was awesome and the bed so cozy I will be buying one for my home. I'm so glad that we rented instead of going to a hotel. Kelly and her family were very hospitable and I would recommend this rental to anyone looking for a cute place to stay in Monterey. Easy to walk to town, quick drive to Carmel. Perfect!"
13710512,172400055,2017-07-20,9041624,Theresa,"Kelley has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and convenient. The cottage is quirky and fun, and she's made it incredibly easy to make  yourself at home, complete with visits from Jethro the cat. It's a quiet neighborhood just up the street from the Aquarium and Cannery Row. Note: yes, it's walkable, but the hills are steep and not so easy for someone with mobility issues. I will say that the beds are the most comfortable I've ever slept in during my travels, including my own! I would definitely stay there again."
13710512,173657319,2017-07-23,8940122,Ashley,"We LOVED our stay at Kelly's place! The location was amazing (walking distance to the aquarium, ocean, shops, restaurants, etc. Everything about the place was great. Kelly and her husband welcomed us and showed us around which was super helpful. The place was super comfy and cozy. Kelly has thought of everything to make a guest's stay ideal. It was so nice to have a well stocked kitchen, delicious pastries, coffee, even almond milk! The bed is really comfortable as is the couch and the big chair. We really couldn't have been happier. We brought our 10-month old who was also happy as a clam. Even though the place isn't perfectly baby proof (and I wouldn't expect it to be) it was really great for a baby (clean carpet to crawl around on, comfy chair for feeding, bedroom gets nice and dark for sleeping, etc).  And, it seemed like such a good deal with all the extras you get plus the passes to the aquarium. These hosts are really generous and wonderful."
13710512,175314140,2017-07-28,122540724,Heather,The location of Kelly and Ken's place is perfect.  We are a family that loves to walk and it was nice not to have to drive around while we were in Monterey for the day.
13710512,179127446,2017-08-06,32524209,Jillian,Kelly & Ken were wonderful hosts and their place provided a cozy and relaxing getaway. Kelly really went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and Ken was terrific with making sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely book again with them. 
13710512,179876433,2017-08-08,139496776,Michelle,We had a wonderful stay!  The place is so close to the downtown and Kelly and Ken are wonderful!!  We would definitely recommend staying here to everyone we know in who is visiting the area.
13710512,180963564,2017-08-11,11398850,Cami,We loved this home! Kelly and Ken were so welcoming and it's clear they wanted to provide a great experience. The home was in an awesome location and Ken gave us excellent suggestions of places to eat. This was such a great place to stay.
13710512,183247594,2017-08-16,66606019,Felipe,It was great! Kelly is a wonderful person. It was one of the best Airbnb experience we had. We will definitely come back. Thank you!
13710512,186181497,2017-08-23,102539893,Jinlai,"Kelly&Ken were so considerate to provide any help we needed. And they were so kind to give us two aquarium passes, which gave us an incredible experience! Would definitely love to stay here again!"
13710512,189116527,2017-08-31,965215,Jeremiah,"Booked Kelly and Ken's place for three people that were attending a conference in Monterey. They were extremely quick in their message replies and accommodated us on several occasions, making it a much easier process. 

The place is small, but quaint. It's not too far from the Monterey wharf, several good restaurants, and the beautiful Monterey coastline. It fit the three of us easily and the beds were quite comfortable.

My only complaint is that the bathroom didn't have a fan, so the bathroom window had to be open after baths, which made the bathroom chilly during the evenings. Not a big deal and definitely not a deal-breaker, just a little annoying. 

Overall, Kelly and Ken were fantastic to work with and their place was perfect. I highly recommend it and would book with them again."
13710512,193465890,2017-09-13,35302633,Ashley,Loved staying here !! I loved the nautical/eclectic decor! The aquarium passes and Polaroid camera were also a nice plus!
13710512,195547437,2017-09-19,8523080,Eileen,"Hello Kelly and Ken:

Your place here in Pacific Grove was just what we hoped it would be.  It provided peaceful surroundings and thoughtful amenities.  It is perfectly situated between the 17 Mile Drive which we biked and the downtown area with its wonderful Aquarium and restaurants.  

Eileen and Richard"
13710512,197212665,2017-09-24,10768095,Barbara,"Kelly & Ken affirm my belief that there is no reason to stay in a motel or overpriced hotel. I was so tickled with their Pacific Grove walkable neighborhood that was so close to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Thanks for including two member passes to the Aquarium. Your warm welcome and lovely treats made this so special. We hope for to return soon. The precious friendly black cat Jethro made us feel totally at home, too."
13710512,197768799,2017-09-26,112774937,Caroline,"Kelly and Ken were great! They were there to greet us and show us around. Very responsive with any inquiries we had. The aquarium passes were really appreciated and they are in a great location - 10 minute walk from the wharf and aquarium, definite plus!"
13710512,204168341,2017-10-16,144883594,Rod,"Please consider this rental because it is cozy, clean, lovely and comfortable for your stay.  It is very apparent that your hosts Ken  and Kelly have been so meticulous in their planning on how to make your stay so calm and uncomplicated that you will be ready to return sooner rather than later!"
13710512,238482797,2018-02-25,5291269,Talia,"The house was very comfortable and definitely convenient!  Kelly and Ken met us at check-in to show us around and they provided us with breakfast foods as well. The house was just a short walk or drive from the beach, restaurants and shops. We'd definitely stay again!"
13710512,240395964,2018-03-04,1269806,Karen,"Kelly and Ken's place is very well-located and extremely well-equipped for a visit to Pacific Grove. We were attending a conference at nearby Asilomar and the space worked very well for two adults to share, yet still have some privacy.  Very comfortable beds and bedding!  Kelly was there to meet us in a person and clearly cares greatly about the comfort of her guests.  Also, the unit is super-clean!!  A very nice stay."
13710512,242374860,2018-03-11,40447624,Karmen,"Small and quant 1 bedroom, 1 bath “condo” 1/2 a mile up the hill up from Cannery Row. It’s a quiet and safe neighborhood. Kelly and Ken are great hosts and don’t overlook any details. They even provide an aquarium pass and some fresh fruit, granola, sparking water for us to enjoy. I would recommend  this place for a couple or one small child. The “condo” is attached to Kelly and Kens home so if you desire a lot of privacy the setup may not be for you. If you like a newer home that’s been completely remodeled this may not be for you. Kelly has taken a lot of time and thought into decorating and thinking of every detail which made a big difference to us. Enjoy!"
13710512,244454940,2018-03-18,39844342,Sandy,Kelly and Ken are great hosts. They thought of everything you might need and then some! The aquarium passes were an added bonus. You will find a comfy bed and a quiet space to relax after a day of sightseeing.
13710512,246973866,2018-03-26,17947270,Heidi,Kelly made us feel so welcome (even our littlest guest). Short walk to the aquarium and all the amenities a family could need. We will be back as soon as possible!
13710512,251917720,2018-04-08,45290748,Rebekah,"This unit is attached to Ken and Kelly's house, so they are just feet away if you need anything, but they are quiet and unobtrusive, the perfect hosts. Kelly has outfitted the house with everything you could possibly need, and then some! Lovely spa items, a diffuser, blackout curtains, pharmacy basics, and so many snacks, along with games and two whole collections of movies for adults and kids. The best part for us was the 2 guest passes to the Monterey bay Aquarium, only half a mile away, downhill. 
I've stayed in plenty of places that were nice, and some that were even thoughtfully stocked, but Ken and Kelly's place is the first one that feels like the hosts created it for themselves, and that you're more than just welcome. 100% my best stay yet."
13715244,85173008,2016-07-10,1143362,Brent,"Jessica's cottage is a comfortable, cozy home in a quaint neighborhood just a short walk from the shops and restaurants of Pacific Grove. A perfect place for a couple or a small group looking to get away for the weekend. It was exactly as described and met our expectations in every way. Thanks!"
13715244,86947773,2016-07-18,12753603,Liat,"The place was probably even nicer than the photos - it was beautifully decorated and the kitchen cupboards were stocked with every piece of kit you could need and good spices etc. It was on the small side for the price, but the whole area seems fairly expensive. It was only a few minutes walk to lots of great restaurants though, and Jessica was extremely helpful in giving us great restaurant recommendations as well as her top pick of local sites. All in all a really wonderful stay in a beautiful property, and a great host."
13715244,88288617,2016-07-24,40335844,Holly,"Jessica was wonderful! Really responsive with questions about the home and even restaurants and beaches. We loved staying in her pristine, stylish, and cozy cottage. Her kitchen has everything you'll need-even a panini press and turquoise pots and pans. It is on a nice, quiet street, and is a lovely walk to everything. We actually loved walking through this neighborhood admiring homes, history, and gardens. It fit 3 adults and 2 little children well. It's not a huge cottage but it was perfect for us-I highly recommend!"
13715244,90208665,2016-07-31,1695457,Barbara,"I apologize for my brevity, but AirBNB requires to review within a week, while I'm still on my trip and only have my phone.
Anyway, we Loved staying at this cottage in Pacific Grove! It was so clean and perfectly furnished for us, a family of 4 (2 young children). The location was nice and quiet for us. 
Unfortunately, I have to go now because I am with 2 kids on a road trip. But, this place is clean, new, beautiful and very practical. I highly highly recommend it!"
13715244,90978131,2016-08-03,78200266,MariCarmen,This is a lovely cottage in Pacific Grove in pristine condition and convenient to all the sights. It looks newly renovated and it is very well equipped both in the bathroom and kitchen areas. It is located in a very quiet area. It is suitable for a couple or a couple with a child. We really enjoyed our stay. 
13715244,92065418,2016-08-07,10360983,Reyna Maria,Host made me feel welcome. Nice neighborhood. I recommend this property. 
13715244,92906365,2016-08-10,55286553,Michael,"We've been to Monterey a few times, but have always either stayed at Pebble, or another hotel nearby.  Never again.  Jessica's little bungalow is just blocks from the water and all the shops and restaurants you can throw a rock at :-)  Her home is small, but plenty for the three of us and is quite nicely decorated and outfitted with brand new everything.  Washer and dryer was icing on the cake!  Also, her friendly and prompt communication was greatly appreciated.  Really fun time, thanks again!"
13715244,94921993,2016-08-17,81929744,Diarmuid,"A gem! Beautifully renovated. Nice quiet neighbour so close to the coast, village and restaurants. Bikes great. Will be back someday! "
13715244,98424613,2016-08-30,90565063,Wendy,"Our host is a wonderful landlady!  Understands the needs of a traveller staying in the area.  Everything listed is true, but I would say the property is much more than I expected.  A truly lucky and exceptional find.  The property is located 5 mins from the sea, close to fabulous local restaurants, a good baker and an a super grocery.  Thoroughly enjoyable stay, i wish I could have stayed longer.  17 mile drive is like a back garden! If this place is available to book, I would highly recommend it!"

13715244,101001528,2016-09-11,1751986,Daniel,Perfect cottage for beach visit. Cozy and close to everything.
13715244,103288145,2016-09-21,54442278,Cathy,"Great little property in the lovely town of Pacific Grove.  Conveniently located in a quiet residential area. Jessica was very prompt and helpful with any queries we had. The kitchen had everything you could possibly need. Thanks for the kettle and teapot, Jessica, first we have had on our road trip! "
13715244,103851722,2016-09-24,53176958,Stacy,We felt welcomed by host and she was very responsive and attentive. The listing was pretty accurate.  The area was as described.
13715244,105383753,2016-10-01,27705393,Victoria,"The house was as described, and the instructions provided were great. Everything we needed was there. We didn't cross paths with Jessica, and didn't need to but she was very responsive via email. "
13715244,113783578,2016-11-13,12226596,Junying,Its amazing house! We all enjoyed the stay! I hope next time I have a time come back stay in . Thanks Jessica give we all the help. 
13715244,115553069,2016-11-25,53091195,Christopher,"The cottage is cozy and really comfortable. There's a spacious bedroom, a living room/kitchen combo (with big and comfortable couches), and a little second bedroom (a ""den"") where our 16-year-old stayed in privacy. The kitchen is modern and well-equipped, with lots of basic food items available (condiments, oils, baking supplies, teas, etc.)--but you should probably ask beforehand if there's something specific that you know you'll need! The cottage is even nicer in person than in the ad--we loved being there, and the walks through the historic neighborhood and down to the shoreline were great. We'd definitely return! "
13715244,116044596,2016-11-27,18770407,Andy,"This little cottage was the perfect getaway location. Very close to all the major sight seeing attractions. The place is even more lovely in person. Jessica is a fantastic host and incredibly responsive.
"
13715244,123787339,2016-12-30,61028619,Jonathan,We had a lovely time at Jessica's house! It was well-located and came with everything we could have wanted or needed. It is even better than the pictures! We would happily come back here again. 
13715244,124393477,2017-01-01,108923966,Fiona,"The cottage was very nice, exactly as described in the Airbnb description. Jessica was very responsive to email and messages."
13715244,157096549,2017-06-02,17618647,Tala,"Amazing find in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood! About 5 minutes walking to downtown Pacific Grove, filled with all sorts of shops and amenities, and 10 minutes from Lover's Point, a scenic part with a small beach. Every amenity (groceries, gas, gym, etc.) were less than 10 minutes driving. I stayed in this home for an extended period of time and Jessica was a fantastic host who answered all my questions and made the move-in/out process very smooth."
13715244,161378719,2017-06-17,74225479,Wendy,"This was a mother/daughter trip and we spent 8 nights at Jessica’s house/cottage. This was a great place to stay. The cottage was obviously a labor of love and the whole place was remodeled from top to bottom. The attention to detail and all the special touches were really nice. The overall space is small but has a nice layout. It has a split floor plan so that the bedrooms are not next to each other. This gives some privacy.   There is no bathtub but the shower is HUGE with all sorts of sprayers. My 8 year old thought the hand held sprayer was way more fun than a bath anyway.  The living room area is very comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. However, despite a really nice kitchen, we ate out quite a bit. The cottage is in a very quiet residential neighborhood and is within walking distance (about 4 blocks) to some really great restaurants. Our favorite was Red House Café which was a recommendation from Jessica. 

The cottage is about 10 blocks to the beach at Lovers Point. This is where the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail starts. You can walk or bike the trail all the way to Seaside. We brought our bikes with us and this was our mode of transportation. From the cottage we rode to the Aquarium, Cannery Row and Fishermans Wharf etc. via the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail. There are two beach cruisers in the back yard. I didn't get a good look at them since we had our own. I highly recommend either walking or biking the trail. One day while biking the trail, we saw a couple of whales. My 8 year-old daughter also managed to count 132 Sea Lions.

This is a beautiful cottage in a great area. I highly recommend staying here. We will be back again!

13715244,162407679,2017-06-20,23426096,Cathy,"This little cottage FAR exceeded our expectations.  It's completely unassuming from the outside.  The ""street"" it's on is actually a little alleyway, and it doesn't really have a front door, you have to go in through a side yard, so we were a little confused when our GPS told us we had arrived.  Once we got inside, we were stunned by how cozy, and clean, and beautiful it was.  It smelled so clean and fresh, and this little cottage got SO much light in it, it was sunny inside all day, even though it was a bit overcast outside.  The bedrooms were cozy, and perfect for our little family of 3.  We cooked all of our meals, the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed.  Everything was new and perfectly designed.  The shower was gorgeous, it's floor is laid with smooth stones, and a few tiles shaped like koi among the stones. The small space was utilized to the fullest extent, while still appearing very minimalist, making it feel very homey.  I don't think the pictures really do it justice.  While we were there, we walked to Lover's Point, which was about a 20 minute walk (with a 5 year old.  And we had to take turns giving her piggy back rides on the way back.  It was a bit far for a youngster.  Not too far for a healthy adult.)  The cute little downtown area wasn't too far, about a 10 minute walk.  The walk is through a fantastic, historical neighborhood, where the older houses have plaques displaying the first owner's name and what year it was built.  It was fun to check them out.  Lover's Point beach was a bit crowded for us, so we went to our favorite beach; Asilomar, which was only about a 5 minute drive away.  Asilomar beach is great for young kids, because it has a lot of little rocky coves with no waves, and tide pools in the rocks.  After a full day at the beach, coming home to a comfortable, cozy little cottage to have a nice, relaxing dinner was just so fantastic.  It was such a great stay, we will definitely stay here again when we go back to Pacific Grove."
13715244,165078131,2017-06-30,114862756,Mary,"Great place to stay.  Jessica is mega quick to respond to all queries. Lovely quiet area and walkable to restaurants, shops and lovely beach. Wifi and Netflix great too!! Thank you Mary"
13715244,169786194,2017-07-13,7110705,Paul,Absolutely perfect for our family. So many perfect little touches for our 4 night stay. Will definitely look for it on our next trip to Monterey. 
13715244,171474102,2017-07-17,15090688,Brennan,"Jessica's house was exactly what we were looking for - easy walking distance to cafes and restaurants, only a few minutes from Lover's Point, and a short drive away from Monterey. We had a great time! "
13715244,173105980,2017-07-22,111656569,Sandra,"This house is in the perfect location. Easy to walk to coffee shops, restaurants and the water. Close to freeway access. Beautiful home and the host was a great communicator. We had a wonderful stay here."

Ten minute walk to the ocean in a cute neighborhood. 
We ran every morning using the costal gravel path. Also used the c"
13715244,178093864,2017-08-04,8308916,Lisa,"Beautifully updated home like you'd see on HGTV or DIY show. Quiet neighborhood, very comfortable and had everything we needed. Great location to Cannery Row. Had a pleasant stay."
13715244,179101274,2017-08-06,11351328,John,"Great house, exactly as described. Location is great, 7 minute walk from downtown Pacific Grove, 12 minute walk from the beach. We hope to stay here again."

13715244,181450615,2017-08-12,30057410,Adam,"Unassuming from the outside, this well appointed cottage provided a great base as our family explored Pacific Grove and Monterey. 

Just a short walk away from both Lovers Point Park and the Aquarium! We shopped at the nearby Trader Joe's and ordered take out from a few restaurants in downtown Pacific Grove.

I would have no problems recommending Jessica's place to anyone traveling with a toddler and/or baby."
13715244,183231548,2017-08-16,4590748,Leslie,"We had a fantastic stay at Jessica's cute, cozy little house. It was perfect for our family of three. Getting in was simple, and it was nice and clean and very well equipped. We loved it. 
We only cooked a couple of times, but managed to set the fire alarms off one of those times with little smoke. So I'd suggest opening the window right behind the stove to avoid that. 
Otherwise, our stay was perfect. The location was great. The walk to Pacific Grove's downtown was less than five minutes. And we walked to the aquarium in Monterey as well in less than 30 minutes. It's a gorgeous walk if you take the path above the shore."
13715244,185430397,2017-08-21,4212684,Sharon,"Jessica's cottage is so comfortable and cozy! The location is terrific -- great neighborhood close to the downtown area and beaches. There are bikes outside, and  kitchen is fully stocked for cooking. While the place is small (2 bedrooms, 1 bath, an eat-in kitchen and small living area), it doesn't feel cramped but, instead, bright and airy. The wooden deck is a nice plus.

Jessica left a house manual that gave us everything we needed to know.

I'd definitely book this place again!"
13715244,187795903,2017-08-27,13567041,Claire,"We had a great visit!  Everything was clean, comfortable, and organized.  We were able to cook a nice dinner using the kitchen and enjoyed a movie on the comfy couch.  Great place!"
13715244,191009046,2017-09-05,26777915,Kirsty,"After 2 weeks staying in hotels, it was fabulous staying is this cute cottage and it was the most relaxed part of our holiday.  Really enjoyed the facilities - fabulous kitchen, laundry and tv.  Location was also beautiful - secluded and quiet but only a stroll to great cafes and restaurants.  I would highly recommend for couples or small families."
13715244,193246113,2017-09-12,104374463,Brittney,This was a fantastic house to stay in for our long weekend to the area. Easy to walk to many restaurants and grocery store and just a short walk to the beach. The house was a perfect size for our needs. The kitchen was well stocked and we had everything we needed  for meals at the house. Would love to come back to the area and stay here again!
13715244,222788752,2017-12-30,95072039,Alexa,We had the best family vacation & were so happy with or stay here. Everything was very clean yet comfortable and cozy feeling. We had plenty of space for our family of three. I can’t say enough good things about our communication with Jessica... she was always quick to respond and more than helpful. I hope to be back again in the future.
13715244,234952627,2018-02-14,162672483,Kathy,This cottage is accurately described in the listing and the reviews. The location is great (after you find it).  The cottage was absolutely adorable and very close to downtown PG and the ocean. We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 night stay!

13715244,250625252,2018-04-05,27195292,Thomas,"Jessica’s place was spotlessly clean, well designed, cosy and superbly located to explore the delights of Pacific Grove, Monterey, Carmel and beyond to Big Sur. She was extremely prompt with communication and provided some top local dining tips. We would highly recommend to anyone especially those travelling with young children!"
13715244,251925798,2018-04-08,11228130,Sally,This is a fantastic place beautifully decorated everything you can want from a home from home. Great place to explore Monterey region and Big Sir
13768901,83551806,2016-07-03,28100963,Brandon,Elaine and Bob were great. Very accommodating for our late evening arrival and we enjoyed chatting with them.  Would definitely stay again if we are ever back in the area!
13768901,84046711,2016-07-05,647928,Shaunta,Really nice place. Close to Cannery Row. Great host and hostess. Will use them again if I'm in the area.
13768901,84655668,2016-07-08,82311851,Allison,"Elaine and Bob are superb hosts!  Elaine graciously welcomed us into her home and showed us around the suite. She offered great dinner recommendations in Pacific Grove. We chose the Red House Cafe and had a delicious meal. We were able to walk from the house to downtown Pacific Grove and after dinner we walked to Lovers Point where we caught the final glimpse of the sunset.  
The room was very nice and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large and had great mirrors. We had a great stay and would recommend highly!"
13768901,85009854,2016-07-10,1739380,Leo,"Elaine was super responsive to any questions we had prior to our arrival. When we arrived, Elaine and Bob graciously gave us a lot of good tips on dinner and sights around the area and even had stacks of menus from local restaurants. The room was comfortable and well appointed. There were no other guests when we stayed so we had the second floor to ourselves. The location is very convenient to sights in Monterey, Pebble Beach, Carmel, and further south to Big Sur.  Thanks for the quick responses and providing a great place for our last-minute excursion to the ocean!"
13768901,85285680,2016-07-11,1841002,Martha,"Elaine and her husband were lovely hosts! While my brother and I only rested our heads for a few hours before heading out to explore Big Sur, we were appreciative of the warm welcome. "
13768901,85439486,2016-07-11,38164065,Susan,"Elaine and Bob were an absolute delight.  They were very gracious hosts, and were warm and generous.  Our room was ready well before it was promised, and was clean and inviting.  They gave us several restaurant recommendations, and the location cannot be beat.  Coffee and chocolates were stocked for us upstairs, which was a nice touch.  We enjoyed visiting with them, and even shared coffee and dessert.  I highly recommend this listing.  "
13768901,86023786,2016-07-14,4415816,Claire,"Elaine and Bob were perfect hosts. We had troubles arriving in town at the time we originally expected, but they were nothing but lovely with a friendly welcome when we arrived - and were very gracious and friendly hosts for the remainder of our visit.
We stayed in the twin room, which was fine for our needs - and we had access to our own bathroom, which was great. Towels and coffee were provided, so we had the basics covered.
Location is great for exploring Big Sur, but having options for food and drink before and after a day in the wilderness. Elaine and Bob gave us some great recommendations for dinner and breakfast places too.
Would def stay here again - and would recommend this as a location for anyone else looking to stay in the area."
13768901,86222432,2016-07-15,23310587,Dorothy,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

13768901,86895973,2016-07-18,80927612,Zack,"Accommodations were lovely and charming. Bob and Elaine are wonderful hosts and have thought of everything a guest might need. The mini fridge and coffee maker in particular were much appreciated bonuses. Elaine recommended my girlfriend and I have our anniversary dinner at Restaurant 1833 in Monterey, which could not have been a more perfect suggestion. We were immensely pleased with our stay and look forward to returning on our next trip to Pacific Grove."
13768901,87324706,2016-07-19,1400240,Daniel,"Elaine and her husband are wonderful, and Monterey could not be more beautiful! My only regret is that we didn't stay longer.

13768901,88157493,2016-07-23,3839224,Tracy,"Great hosts -- Elaine & Bob are so friendly, helpful, and respectful of your vacation time.  They offered tips for the area.

The space was very nice.  Super clean, super private and quiet.  You rent a master suite with a fridge, microwave, and, I believe, a coffee maker (I can't remember about the coffee maker...b/c we didn't make any!).  Has nice, roomy closet in the room too.

Quick drive to beach....or you could walk it too (not sure how many blocks that'd be...but it'd be fun walking through the residential areas).  It's very close to everything that you'd want to do in Monterey or Pacific Grove.

Was a great place to stay!"
13768901,88448886,2016-07-24,1094707,Kathy,"Initial meeting and welcome was very nice and proper with great care to show us their upstairs rooms for our stay.  This space is well suited for people who want to eat out most of their stay as the kitchen is not available.  We decided to think of it as lovely upstairs hotel rooms. The owners are kind and the dog is quiet.  The home is very quiet, the rooms very clean and the little chocolates in the room were delicious."
13768901,88910977,2016-07-26,5491598,Beverly,Elaine was very gracious in welcoming us.  The house was very clean.  The master suite was smaller than we expected.

13768901,92502074,2016-08-08,79903993,Rose,What kind and wonderful hosts you guys are. We had the most romantic and memorable time at Pacific Grove thanks to your suggestions on where to go and what to do. I have already started telling everyone to go there. Thank you so much for your hospitality.

My mom wants to try their homemade food, unfortunately, their kitchen does not work but they recommend me a great restaurant and Bob bought us breakfast. The house is in a very quiet and lovely place. The room is very clean and cozy, especially the bed. So I have to struggle to get up in the morning. All in all, it is very luck to have a room like this. And their house is near Lovers Point where you can walk."

The room was comfortable and clean too.  It worked out great because I was traveling solo for the night, and I'd stay there again if I found myself in Monterey."
13768901,101861701,2016-09-15,1445921,Celine,"The hosts were very welcoming and full of advice/information as to what to do in the right order.
Since we like to walk their place was very well located between Pebble Beach and Pacific Grove.  Great restaurants nearby.
We are thinking of recommending their place for relatives visiting in a few months' time as well as when we will be visiting again next year."
13768901,102925934,2016-09-19,58404287,Grace,"Elaine was a kind and pleasant host! She responds very quickly to messages. Her husband, Bob, has a good sense of humor. The room is even more beautiful in person and I'm jealous that my bathroom at home isn't as big as this one! Elaine had a great selection of coffees and teas in the room as well as bite size candy bars, water, etc. I thought this was really cool: they have a world map by the front door and you stick a pin in your city so they can see where they've had guests from! Very neat idea. Definitely recommend staying here."

It's really a homey place to stay when we are traveling overseas."
13768901,104182062,2016-09-25,90246348,Christine,"Bob & Elaine are wonderful hosts.  They are very welcoming at your greeting, have you pin your hometown on their map of the world, give you great suggestions on anything in the area you might be looking for, show you your room and then give you the key to the front door.  From there you'll never know they're in the house elsewhere.  The room was fantastic and was so relaxing with an attached bath.  Loved just relaxing on the bed and hearing the quiet of nature outside the window.  Great location to restaurants and quaint shops of Pacific Grove.  Easy access to Monterey and Carmel as well.  Would stay here over and over!"
13768901,104977171,2016-09-29,74414793,Karen,"Elaine and bob were great hosts and made us very welcome. The room was very clean and well equipped with a coffee machine, fridge and microwave.  We were on our honeymoon so they gave us some wine on arrival  as well.  They were always happy to recommend places to visit in the local area, and the room had plenty of info  about  the sea as well.  Would be happy to stay again. "

It is in a location that is very convenient to the restaurants and shops of Pacific Grove, as well as quite close to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the 17 Mile Drive. The room was very pretty and comfortable, and the bathroom was great. Big fluffy towels, and two sinks if you have someone traveling with you. There was also a Keurig and other amenities. The neighborhood also felt very safe and welcoming. I definitely recommend for anyone who wants a peaceful stay in a nice setting!"

13768901,108141130,2016-10-14,99218029,Hannah,"They were amazing hosts and knowledgeable about the area. Their home is centrally located to all major destinations and about 30 minutes to Big Sur. The master bedroom was clean and comfortable with attached bathroom.

13768901,109980329,2016-10-23,4422629,Sebastien,"Everything about Elaine and her place should make you happy! They are located fairly close to the center. The house is spacious and the room is prepared with such details that many hotels could be jealous.
Elaine and her husband are really nice and will welcome you warmly in their house, making sure that you have and know everything to enjoy your stay not only at their place, but in Monterey in general."

13768901,114888916,2016-11-20,103145645,Helen,"I adored the large mounted map on the wall with the pins of prior guests original locations. Was ideal.  Both Elaine and Bob were very friendly and open to us. And explained the plus/minus of having one of these. But it is ideal especially in today's job market.

Fantastic people to befriend. And honest too."
13768901,115211767,2016-11-22,19384775,Tim,"Elaine and Bob were both very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  They pointed me to the local restaurants and made my stay very easy.

Their set-up is ideal for a guest:  with a private room upstairs and direct access to the front door from the stairs it can be quite private if you want.  The house is at the end of a quiet road, so it's very quiet.

The en-suite room is fully equipped with coffee maker and little snacks.
There is a bath-tub in the bathroom (which I like).

It's a long-ish walk to the high street (which has a lovely neighbourhood feel - there was a farmers market the day I was there), so I drove."

We were free to do our own thing, but it was also really nice getting to know the hosts and learning an insider's perspective on the area. Probably my favorite part was enjoying a relaxing evening on their beautiful back patio, a real treat!"

13768901,144819347,2017-04-16,63971597,India,"Elaine and Bob are both very pleasant people and very easy to communicate with. We enjoyed Bob's welcome spiel and adding our pins to their lovely world map. It's always nice to stay with Airbnb hosts who enjoy hosting and have good energy. The neighborhood is peaceful and filled with singing and chirping birds in the morning and melodic wind chimes during the day. It was sunny and cool during our trip so we took advantage of exploring Cannery Row, which is only a 10min drive away (tops). Lighthouse Ave is also worth exploring - has cafe's and restaurants all along it, gas, and a CVS even. It is a very long avenue. If you're a walker you'll find that walking to either Cannery Row (30min walk) and Lighthouse Ave (10min walk) from here are close and make nice walks. I'd say most of this area is walkable for those who love walking.  We enjoyed staying in the master bed with attached bathroom (lots of mirrors), and spacious. Having a microwave, mini fridge, and Keurig coffee and tea with mugs in our room was convenient, to say the least. All in all, our stay here was enjoyable and comfortable."

The location is close to many things in a central location. The place is quiet in a neighborhood. We had a car, so I am not sure how it would be without a car."

13768901,153314831,2017-05-20,128883707,Cornelius,"Out host was really sweet and made us feel very welcome. The bedroom was a bit smaller than we had imagined, but the bathroom was larger than we had imagined. All in all, good value for money. It was an approximately $7 Lyft ride to Monterrey which was nice. There were some minor housekeeping issues - a bit of dust, a few stray hairs in the bathroom and unfortunately we found the refrigerator in the room not working and uncleaned. "
13768901,153652023,2017-05-21,17009479,Zach,"If you're looking for a tranquil, restful and rejuvenating stay in Pacific Grove, look no further.  "

13768901,160570595,2017-06-14,873679,Kathy,"Elaine's place was perfect for our quick 1 night get-away with the family.  It was a short drive to the aquarium (30 min walking) and a 15 minute walk to restaurants and shops on the main drag. We didn't need much besides comfortable beds and warm showers. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The hosts greeted us at check-in and check-out, otherwise we didn't see them.  

We would definitely stay again!"

Todo es muy lindo. La cama es excelente. La ubicación ideal entre Monterey y muy cerca de 17miles dr. Recomendable para ir en familia.

13768901,213899018,2017-11-23,18556281,Jacklyne,Elaine's place is very closed to 17-mile drive. The house is very sweet and clean and the couple was very hospitable. They gave us a lot of great recommendations for our next-day itinerary on Route 1 and they all proved to be  highlights of our trip! It's very rare to find a 2-bed+2-bath AirBnB in this area with this kind of hospitality. I'll definitely recommend everyone who travels along Route 1 or around Monterey/Big Sur/17-mile to stay at Elaine's place.

总体性价比不高吧。"

They have a board showing the world mounting at the bottom of the staircase full of location pins representing guests from around the world.

Bob and Elaine are very hospitable and great hosts! Bob stayed up late Monday night because we were running late, and he was very warm and inviting when we arrived tired and ready for bed.

The room was immaculate, the bathroom was large (we had the whole upstairs!) and they had a bottle of wine out for us! Highly recommend staying here! It got our honeymoon off to a great start!  :)"

I travelled with my husband and mother-in-law and the layout of the upstairs unit is clever as it allows privacy between the rooms. Elaine and Bob are just lovely and homey. After giving a very warm welcome, unless you need or want otherwise, you are left on your own. I highly recommend staying with them."

13902577,93103841,2016-08-11,87078751,Bill,"Totally  updated house with modern kitchen and baths. Very charming with many new stained glass windows that were easy to open.  Gas Fireplaces in living room and Master bedroom that turn on with the flip of a switch.    Great location one block from beach, and walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and Aquarium.  Good communication with owners that were very helpful."

It's only one block to the beach,just two mins walking. We went to beach everyday during our stay. And it's close to restaurant,coffee shop and stores too. We enjoyed our stay here. We definately recommend this house to everybody."
13902577,101010438,2016-09-11,16932443,Sholeh,"Adorable house, clean and comfortable house. Great location, within walking distance to Lovers Point, shops and restaurant.

13902577,107510313,2016-10-10,36389972,Christy,"The area was fantastic. Loved the location. It is a couple of blocks to the beach and a couple of blocks to downtown Pacific Grove. It's very quiet and small. Perfect for a couple. I would love to stay here again in this cute, historical home. Communication was great. Thanks so much! "
13902577,110205928,2016-10-24,99882673,(Email hidden by Airbnb),Yes and very easy to communicate with

The owners were very helpful and responsive throughout the entire process.   We would love to stay here again when our travels take us back to this area.   "
13902577,146726437,2017-04-23,199055,Kris,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at the little pink victorian in Pacific Grove.  The home has been wonderfully remodeled and is clean, comfortable, and has all the amenities that one needs for a vacation stay.  The location is fantastic - a short walk to Lover's Point (a great beach for kids!) and to downtown Pacific Grove for your morning coffee or antique shop browsing.  We had a couple of minor issues (smoke alarms without batteries, hot water heater not turned on), but we were able to fix these ourselves and the owners were very responsive when we reported the issues.  Overall, a wonderful stay in Pacific Grove!"
13902577,157833639,2017-06-04,126142809,Thomas,"It is a very nice house in a great and quiet neighborhood with excellent walkability, and with plenty to do in town and in Carmel and points south. We especially liked that we could easily walk to a place to rent bikes or kayaks, and also the walk to the aquarium was very pleasant and not far. There is so much natural coastline beauty just 2-3 blocks away. Just a great environment to both relax and have fun."
13902577,167170894,2017-07-05,133802219,Matt,"What a wonderful experience staying at the Pink House in PG.  My family had a fantastic time exploring the area from the perfect basecamp.  Communication was exceptional, even when the host was on the other side of the world!  All questions were answered almost instantly, and the property was exceptional.  Such care and craftsmanship went into the remodel and decoration.  We felt a part of history in this beautiful space.  My only recommendation would be to add an extra blow-up mattress, as although the bedrooms are large, there are only 2 beds.  My kids did pretty well sharing a bed, but the little one may have slept better on a cot.  Not a knock though- this place was even better than advertised.  If my family ever makes it back to Monterey (which we hope) we will definitely plan to stay here again."
13902577,172094448,2017-07-19,128152565,David,Loved this beautiful pink house! House was spotless . Location was perfect . Walk to restaurants and shops . Would stay there again for sure. Thanks for a great family memory !

13902577,176415138,2017-07-30,128727779,Pam,The historic pink house is in a fantastic location. It is a short walk to  the  beach at Lovers Point where we rented bicycles and enjoyed a long ride on a safe off road path with beautiful ocean views. The house is also close to very nice restaurants and shops. The home was clean and comfortable. The  hosts reached out to us to be sure that we knew that the Festival of Lanterns was going on while we were there and they messaged us the schedule of events. The fireworks were fun. Our only small issue was initially connecting to the internet and the hosts immediately corrected the problem. We really enjoyed our stay !
13902577,179117317,2017-08-06,9377165,David,"We spent a lovely weekend in the cottage, and would certainly visit again. It's spotless, comfortable, and perfectly located– 1 block to the beach in one direction and 1 block to lots of good restaurants in the other direction. It's quiet and outside of the touristy area, but a quick 4-5 minute drive away from the aquarium and Cannery Row. We appreciated and made use of the aquarium guest passes– go there early and pet the bat rays while they're the most active."
13902577,185107578,2017-08-20,127228490,Kaushal,We really enjoyed our stay at this house . House was immaculate and very comfortable.
13902577,190754771,2017-09-04,15472852,Bita,"The cottage is located a couple of blocks from the beach. It was clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The host was communicative and responded quickly. 
We arrived on an unusually hot day which was unbearable, but after the sun down we managed to cool the house down. Beds were comfortable and clean and had plenty of blankets and pillows and the same goes for the bathrooms, tastefully remolded and decorated.
This lovely cottage is in walking distance to great cafes, restaurants and great little shops.
This was our first time visiting Pacific Grove, but definitely not our last.
Wilson were wonderful hosts, and although we never met they kept in touch throughout our stay.
This is wonderful little gem in a fantastic location."
13902577,197141979,2017-09-24,49296743,Kristine,"The Wilson's home is on a peaceful street within walking distance to the shops and restaurants in downtown Pacific Grove as well as the bay (bonus for those who want to watch the sunrise in the morning).  It was also very cool to read the books they provided regarding the history of the pink house as well as history of SF and it's architecture. 

The hosts were quick to respond to any questions. They provided helpful recommendations for the neighborhood sights and activities. The home is as described and an ideal location if you're looking for a place to relax.

We look forward to visiting again soon and hope their home is available for our next trip."
13902577,203837564,2017-10-15,53926952,Mike,The house is in a great location just 2 block walk to Beach and 2 block walk to downtown pacific Grove.
13902577,214346560,2017-11-25,26603271,Sheila,The Little Pink House is adorable.  It is perfect for two couples - two separate bedrooms (Queen bed in each) each with a bathroom on two separate floors.  Location is perfect for walking along mainstreet or along the coast.  The pictures are accurate.  The Wilsons are fantastic at answering questions. We enjoyed staying here.

14266085,95143626,2016-08-18,14765027,MacKay,"Location, location, location! We couldn't have been happier staying so close to the ocean and walking trail. We actually saw harbor seals on the beach while walking to a great local restaurant for dinner. The beds were cozy and the neighborhood very quiet (other than those pesky seagulls!)"

14266085,97931389,2016-08-29,23858377,Keelia,"What a wonderful location and a wonderful home. Super short walk to amazing views and fun activities. We had an absolutely fabulous time. The neighborhood is serenely quiet and perfectly located. The house is quaint and sweet and has a nice kitchen setup and tons of natural light. There's an iPod/speaker set up that's loaded with awesome music. We put it on shuffle and enjoyed it the whole time we were in the house. I would definitely book again and bring more people next time (to help with the cost). There are 2 bedrooms (with queen beds, I believe) and 3 comfy couches. What a joy!!! "
14266085,98136868,2016-08-29,72210223,Ching,"Overall it's a really cozy and comfortable place to stay in. The location is great - the beach is just at your door step, Lover's Point is a few blocks away; Fisherman's Wharf and Cannery Row and 5 minutes drive away. Joy is also very prompt in replying to my messages, superb host!"
14266085,99452258,2016-09-04,6846506,Arshiya,Viveca's place is a quaint little place closer to the bay and close to many activities. My boyfriend and I stayed here with another couple. We weren't there for much more than sleeping and it worked out fine. We were able to get on the Bay trail for a run on Sunday morning very easily. The space was a little crowded for 2 couples. The living space was nice and comfortable. Overall it worked out just fine for us.
14266085,99824581,2016-09-06,92371605,John,"Perfect location, quiet neighborhood steps from the ocean. Only problem with the stay sad the length.  It was too short!  "
14266085,101023226,2016-09-11,73477710,Heidi,"We felt at home right away. The host was easy to access, the check in and check out was seamless, the place is artfully decorated and the location could not be better.  The beds were also very comfortable so we slept very well."

14266085,102702114,2016-09-18,15896002,Silvia,"The cottage was lovely and we enjoyed our stay here. I was in town with a few friends for a wedding. We only stayed one night, but it was a pleasant stay - everything was just as expected. The area is lovely, and only one block away there is a path for walkers and bikers right by the ocean, very picturesque. Local, quaint coffee shops and restaurants are within walking distance of the house. The area is quiet and protected from the sounds of traffic, and we slept very well here. I would definitely recommend this place."
14266085,104196439,2016-09-25,10098915,Katherine,"The Spanish Cottage made for a great weekend writing retreat. We felt as though we were spending time in a cozy New England beach town!  The location was perfect -- within a stone's throw of the ocean as well as both downtown Pacific Grove and Monterey, and just off the running path along the coastline. I enjoyed a walk to the water with freshly brewed coffee from the kitchen each morning, and both beds were very comfortable. Viveca and Joy were responsive and made us feel welcomed from arrival to departure. Overall, we found the cottage an excellent place of respite for our visit to Monterey. "

14266085,108297363,2016-10-15,96105681,Hui En,"The house is a bit old and small. I don't like the carpenter. There is no stainless steel window-screen, it can't prevent mosquito and other winged insect. And I think it's not safe also. The location is good. "
14266085,108623003,2016-10-16,13227523,Advait,"This place is a ~20 min walk from Monterey Aquarium and right next to a nice walking trail along the bay.
Great place to stay. Would definitely recommend it."
14266085,109987185,2016-10-23,15103663,Janelle,"The stay here was really great! We loved being walking distance from the beach and Monterey Bay Aquarium. One thing that I didn't realize was that the only heat was the furnace in the living room, which was fine because it wasn't too cold this weekend but might be challenging later in the winter. Other than that it was perfect. "
14266085,110361675,2016-10-25,34475493,Ian,"The check in process was exactly as described. We showed up, key was available and the home was exactly as described.

Neighborhood is super quiet and it's great for families with kids too!"

14266085,120785543,2016-12-11,4427084,Lee And Carrie,We really enjoyed this great little find in Pacific Grove! It's just 6 houses from the beach and a quick walk to downtown. We really appreciated the well equipped kitchen and the extra cooking condiments - great touches that made our short stay really good! Perfect for our group of 2 adults and 1 kid.
14266085,122461042,2016-12-23,48533499,Jean,We loved this cute little house next to the ocean.  We took long walks along the ocean path and to the town each morning.  Check in and out was easy and Viveca and Jim responded quickly whenever we had a question.   Thank you!
14266085,122599401,2016-12-24,108146852,Raj Kishore,Me and my visited pacific Grove for couple days. We stayed Viveca's place and it was nice and clean. It's very near to sea. Only problem was power. There was power outage for nearly 1 hour in the night. Later Viveca's fixed the power issue and everything is back to normal.
14266085,122732649,2016-12-25,105928379,Valoy,"Cottage is located within walking distance to beach, restaurants, aquarium. Great to just park car and not use it til you leave. Love the ocean and cottage is comfortable. "

14266085,124760571,2017-01-02,98503013,Kelly,"We had a wonderful week's stay here with our 2 kids. The location was amazing, perfect distance to the ocean, aquarium and Lover's Point. Easy access to downtown PG too. We visited a tide pool close by every night before retiring. The cottage had everything we needed and more. Many of the nights or mornings we stayed in for our meals and had plenty to work with in the kitchen. The place was very cozy and warm and quiet. The bedrooms were at the back so it was nice to have the living room up front to stay up in after putting the kids to bed. Joy was very responsive with property or area related questions. Thanks again!!"
14266085,127735454,2017-01-20,9440759,Ben,Excellent home in a great location perfect for what we needed.

14266085,131581409,2017-02-12,36815643,Kyle,"Viveca and Jim are phenomenal hosts! They clearly think a great deal about how to make their guests as comfortable as possible. The house was beautiful and clean and stocked with everything we could possibly need. There were extra blankets and linens to make up a third bed, snacks and drinks in the kitchen for breakfast, even detergent for laundry. And it really is just steps away from a spectacular path along the beautiful ocean coastline."
14266085,133608841,2017-02-23,66208649,Kris,Our family of four had a great stay at the Spanish cottage! The kitchen was fully furnished and we cooked all of our meals. The cottage is a short walk from the aquarium so we were able to walk home when our toddlers needed a nap. The street is quiet and the house is just perfect! Every room was comfortable and offered the rest that we needed. The snacks were much appreciated. The stay was worth every penny! Thanks again!
14266085,134320097,2017-02-26,7954834,Stephen,"Viveca and Jim's Spanish style house was the perfect weekend getaway. The location is great — one block away from the bay-front walk/bike path, and a short walk to both Lovers Point and Monterey Bay Aquarium. The house is incredibly comfortable and well furnished, not to mention stocked with plenty of coffee, tea, and snack options! The hosts are quick with communication and flexible with the needs of their guests (we forgot a watch and they not only found it for us, but let us sneak back in hours after check-out to retrieve it).

14266085,139865903,2017-03-26,2584030,Divya,Thank you for sharing your home. We were out at Monterey for a girls getaway and your house was perfect to just relax and take a lovely walk by the sea. We didn't cook much but the kitchen was super well stocked. 
14266085,140544225,2017-03-30,517752,Dave,We had such a wonderful stay. Location is perfect. Walkable to all the sights and tucked away on a nice quiet street. We enjoyed daily strolls on the oceanfront path just steps from the house. Everything in the house was clean and tidy and we would love to come back again someday. Thanks!
14266085,140959462,2017-04-01,19643668,Brian,Loved this place! It was a cozy place to call home for the night and we loved that it was a short walk to the walking path along the ocean. Would stay here again next time we travel through Monterey.
14266085,141298606,2017-04-02,83858423,Liang,"The house is clean. The beds are clean. Everything works pretty properly.

14266085,144092159,2017-04-14,62702455,Damien,"Excellent location in Monterey. My four and five year olds easily walked to the aquarium, Lovers Point, and the shops/restaurants in Pacific Grove. Cottage was clean and comfortable with lots of of small touches to make one feel at home.  I would definitely recommend and we would love to visit again."
14266085,144825326,2017-04-16,1352645,Rebecca,"We stayed at Viveca and Jim's place with grandparents and our 1-year-old, and everyone enjoyed the home! The living room is well supplied with comfortable couches, and the kitchen is stocked with nice snacks and tea/coffee. The beds were very comfortable as well. The location of this house is great, as you can easily walk to both the Monterey Aquarium/Cannery Row as well as downtown Pacific Grove, which has lots of nice shops and restaurants."
14266085,146350166,2017-04-22,60669793,Joshua,"The place is in an incredible location. Viveca and Jim were very accommodating and helpful! Even when I became ill at the last minute and could not travel, they treated my colleague with the same warm welcome and comfortable stay."
14266085,146728423,2017-04-23,16263722,Sarah,"The home was well-equipped, very close to shopping and restaurants.  It was just down the street from the Cannery Row shopping area and a delicious Italian restaurant that we loved.  It was a lovely spot for a reunion weekend with a small group of friends.  We particularly loved that coffee, snacks and breakfast items were provided!"

It's walking distance to the beach, aquarium and plenty of resturaunts and if you don't mind walking it's also easy enough to get to Fisherman's Wharf. We will definitely be back! "
14266085,151641065,2017-05-13,26971777,Karen,"Feels much larger on the inside. Nice living space, kitchen, dining area. Lots of snacks, tea, coffee, cereal, sweets. Super close to the beach. "

14266085,156504022,2017-05-30,130059673,Julie,"You will not find a better location! Wonderful, comfortable little house.  The hosts were easy to communicate with, and the easy street parking make this a wonderful base to explore the peninsula from. "
14266085,157864951,2017-06-04,69960368,Stephanie,"Lovely, cosy little house in the most superb location two minutes from the most glorious seafront. Joy managed the place for Jim and Viveca to a high standard, responded v quickly when contacted and the hosts were v generous in the provisions they left plus info about the town. Town itself is gorgeous of course, 

Steph, Hil and Roger"
14266085,159351612,2017-06-10,53596616,Suzanne,"Comfortable and quiet location.  Convenient for sight-seeing in Monterrey, grocery stores and restaurants.  Appreciated having tea, coffee and microwave popcorn.  Very short walk to get down to see the ocean and a nice biking/walk path up to Lover's Point.  "
14266085,159824693,2017-06-11,26124218,Michelle,"Great location, comfortable and cozy. Really nice stay! "
14266085,160824807,2017-06-15,10674211,Thomas,"Viveica and Jim's place is cute, clean and in a great location. We loved being  a 1 minute walk to the beautiful Monterey coast. We saw whales, otters, seals, sea birds, crabs, and other sea life. Just a few minutes walk to the aquarium and cannery row, and a few minutes drive to the 17 mile drive. We will be back. "
14266085,161311310,2017-06-17,28003060,Stephen,This is a great location. Easy to walk to the beach or town. The house has everything you need for a wonderful stay. Highly recommended.
14266085,162113884,2017-06-19,119287042,Joshua,"This little beach cottage is just perfect and the neighborhood was lovely.  For a busy summer Saturday and Sunday we felt like there was no one around.  The location was amazing and even better than we expected.  We walked to Lover's Point on our first afternoon and then chose to walk to the Aquarium the next day.  About 1/2 mile walk if you are interested.  After dinner a walk to watch the sunset is about 2 minutes.    Everything worked out perfect, super comfy couches, internet worked well.  Only suggestion I have is to add a DVD/BluRay player to the living room, otherwise this was the perfect end to our wonderful road trip.  "
14266085,163377836,2017-06-24,122258201,Grace,"What a great location! We couldn't believe how close we were to such breathtaking views. Within our first 15 mins there, we were able to see whales! Also a good location for longer day trips! We made it to Santa Cruz, Big Sur, and even the Sequioa National park. We will miss this little cottage. "
14266085,163925350,2017-06-25,108189973,Shannon,We loved our stay at Viveca and Jim's. Adorable place and great location. The second bedroom is very small but cozy. We'd love to stay here again in the future.

14266085,165025273,2017-06-30,4657527,Ashley,Viveca and Jim's house was great! Communication was fast and check in and out was easy. Took their rec for breakfast and it was yummy! Wish we had stayed more than one night!!!
14266085,165347994,2017-07-01,108977716,Dave,"Great home perfectly located to water, town and walking trail. Well kept, roomy and great value for money. Was treated very professionally. Most enjoyable experience."

The location was also wonderful with lots of things to do for little kids and adults.  Couldn't recommend it more highly!"

14266085,171079835,2017-07-16,3707162,Fico,A cozy and fully equipped house. You can walk to the sea in 2 minutes. The view along the coastline is beautiful. The manager Joy is really helpful. She responsed timely whenever you need help. Highly recommended!
14266085,172100590,2017-07-19,79289537,Tony,"Great house centrally located in Pacific Grove/Monterey. Quiet neighborhood, close walk to oceanfront trails, and the Monterey Aquarium. The house was very clean and well furnished/decorated. Filled with lots of essentials for the family to make the stay even more enjoyable. 

Would definitely recommend Viveca and Jim's place and we will most certainly be back!"
14266085,173096399,2017-07-22,91312135,Michael,"A great place to stay in Monterey! We stayed here as part of our drive from San Fransisco to LA - it was a perfect stop. Gorgeous location, right by the sea. Spotlessly clean, great amenities, very spacious - a tea home from home. Fantastic communication - can't recommend the place enough. "
14266085,173715848,2017-07-23,376217,Mariko,Cozy and cute house in an amazing location - we loved being so close to the ocean and the beach at Lover's Point. Perfect place to stay with kids for a weekend trip to Monterey Bay aquarium. Appreciate the ease of check in/out and the thoughtful extras.

14266085,179557332,2017-08-07,131228528,Betsy,"This cozy, comfortable cottage was in easy walking distance of many shops and restaurants, the amazing Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the scenic Lover's Point park. From the cottage, it was an easy drive south on Highway 1 into beautiful Big Sur region and within a few hours of San Francisco when we continued our trip along the Pacific Coast Highway. We had a lovely stay here and highly recommend it!"
14266085,180597626,2017-08-10,7137749,Tori,"My family of four (2 adults, 5 year old, 2 year old) stayed here recently and really enjoyed our stay. The house is perfect for a family vacation rental. The location honestly can't be beat! It's half a block from the shore and a few blocks from downtown PG. We walked to the PG Farmers Market, Monterey aquarium, Monterey/Cannery Row, and Lovers Beach. It's a two minute drive to the start of the 17-mile drive and close to a great Trader Joe's, which is our grocery spot. 

The second bedroom is small but worked fine for my two kids to share a bed. It is definitely kid-friendly with even a few toys for them to play with. At nice it's very quiet, with the exception of some resident seagulls that were so awesome to listen to when falling asleep at night.

The kitchen was well appointed with everything you would need to cook a nice meal in. We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area. Thanks!"
14266085,181982625,2017-08-13,4028749,Liz,Great location!
14266085,185854992,2017-08-22,132636488,Scott,Excellent little cottage for the price. Close to everything. Well stocked and maintained.
14266085,186479457,2017-08-24,56875678,Celine,"We (a family of 4) had a wonderful time at Viveca and Jim's house. It is a very charming little house, very comfortable, cosy, perfect for relaxing holidays, and walkable to every points of interest in Pacific Grove (many restaurants and cafes included). We enjoyed watching deers gathering in the neighbour's frontyard, or otters at the beach. We highly recommend this house !"
14266085,187277655,2017-08-26,53364456,Phoebe,Great place for retreat!
14266085,190639836,2017-09-04,53238713,Patricia,An amazing spot.  Stroll down the block to observe sea otters in their natural habitat after seeing them at the aquarium.  Lovers point is an excellent beach for kids. This cosy cottage was perfect for a relaxing vacation.
14266085,192066880,2017-09-09,5050259,Diane,"Location, location, location!!!  The home is sandwiched between the coastal bike/walking trail with gorgeous views and a neighborly, historic downtown with restaurants and shops.  Viveca and Jim thoughtfully provided us with snacks, games, books, and cozy housing during our stay in the quaint town of PG.  The dancing whale statues greeted us on the shoreline just a short stroll down the block.  At the same time, nearby trees--resisting the force of the afternoon wind--squeaked and squealed as if singing a whale's song.  It was a magical beginning to our short holiday.  We had much to celebrate so splurged on a delicious, 5-star dinner at Montrio Bistro.  This home and restaurant are highly recommended!"
14266085,192660541,2017-09-10,116259465,Kimberly,"The home was lovely, although we had a couple of concerns. The couch throws by the wall smells and especially the bed in the smaller room. It smells like sweat mixed with perfume spray and something else. We ended up not staying in that room as the odor was really strong especially on the inner linens and pillows. Good thing we had sleeping bags with us and we slept on the living room floors instead. The bigger bedroom was okay according to my sister. It was already late at night when we were about to go to bed when we noticed the smell so we didn't wanted to contact the manager/owner by then. I hope they pay attention with changing the linens and beddings and with cleanliness all in all. It was a really uncomfortable stay."
14266085,193769275,2017-09-14,7920848,Benjamin,We enjoyed our stay at the Pacific Grove cottage very much. It was a perfect location to explore Pacific Grove and visit the aquarium. Both are an easy walk from the house. The home was clean and the bed was comfortable. It was a great place to bring our infant on our first family vacation!
14266085,194384721,2017-09-16,148596622,Douglas,Perfect location for a weekend getaway. Thank you for allowing us to visit.
14266085,195547505,2017-09-19,25791068,Tara,"My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location couldn't be better! You are just a few steps away from a pristine coastal view, where we had a picnic sunset dinner.  The beds were comfy, the home cozy and well-equipped. We walked to the red house cafe for breakfast one day and saw so many cute houses along the way. Explored the aquarium of course and did a 9am kayak trip with Monterey bay kayaks (A++), both things 5 minutes away. We sure did miss the homey-ness while we were freezing our butts off camping in Yosemite during their unexpected early first snow! Highly recommend."
14266085,197194970,2017-09-24,5178994,Barry,"Perfectly located with convenient access to walking paths, parks, and local attractions. The home was stocked with everything we needed. Loved how many towels and extra linens were available. Lots of street parking. Home is just the right size for a small family visit."

14266085,202544046,2017-10-11,143997237,Maggie,A seaside cottage getaway!  A few steps from the waves and outfitted with all you may need!!   Perfect for a two day landing between other trips and just what we needed to recharge and forget our cares.
14266085,203809241,2017-10-15,4724295,Harry,It is a great location for a walkable situations. All-in-all a good rental. If I have to get nitpicky There are some dust collecting and older/worn entities that can be updated to improve impression. There are many great touches like the tourism literature and the treats in the kitchen...The location makes up for anything else.
14266085,204763495,2017-10-19,6415602,Sara,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at Viveca and Jim's sweet house.  We enjoyed it so much!  As everyone mentions, the location is fantastic--we walked to the Aquarium, up to the shops on Lighthouse, and along the water after dinner.  We especially appreciated: the well stocked kitchen--complete with a jar of Halloween chocolate, the washer and dryer, the easy check out instructions, all the couches and big coffee table (perfect for our young children to play with  toys and puzzles), the extra fans  (needed for the hot days early in our stay) and furnace (needed at the end of our stay), and quick, easy communication.  The second bedroom worked perfectly for our two children, but it is small.  We were really happy here and greatly enjoyed our visit."
14266085,207773277,2017-10-29,89408101,Nicole,"Love the location. This home is walking distance to the Aquarium, Cannery Row, the whale watching boats. Lovely paths along the water are right at the end of the street. The kitchen is well stocked and the living room was roomy and comfortable. We enjoyed the stay very much."
14266085,208954546,2017-11-03,2921555,Sarah,"My mum was visiting from Canada so I took her and my toddler to Monterey - we had such a lovely stay. Once we parked at the house, we didn’t drive throughout our stay - we were walking distance to the aquarium, the ocean, the playground, and great restaurants. We were able to check in early and check out late to accommodate my daughter’s naps which I really appreciated - as well as the great food recommendations. I hope to visit again - thanks for a great stay!"
14266085,211412865,2017-11-12,24716072,CIndy,Location was absolutely fantastic!  Cute cottage in the heart of PG.  We are a family of 4 and was perfect.  Our hosts were also fantastic - quick to respond to emails/messages!

14266085,224322541,2018-01-02,3028234,Dami,We hat a good time at your place. It is a bit different than it looks on the pictures. We assumed a bit more style for this price. But it was an overall good experience and the house is very close to the ocean. The communication was great and so the check in. Thank you.
14266085,224654364,2018-01-03,12759266,Kathleen,"The location was the best -- a block to the ocean, quick and easy walk to the aquarium, and even easy to park! A very quiet neighborhood and lively home."
14266085,227379803,2018-01-14,2265668,Schuyler,This home's location is the star. It really is one block from the ocean. We enjoyed a lovely walk by the water when we woke up. 
14266085,229620866,2018-01-24,149002329,Ann,"Lovely, centrally located house within walking distance to the beach, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, whale watching, bakeries and restaurants.  We could see whale spouts from the beach, sea otters and seals in the bay.  Great walking trails just a half block away.  Would definitely stay here again!!!"

14266085,234142736,2018-02-11,171300551,Jeremy,My experience staying here was excellent. The house was clean and had a ton of amenities that my group enjoyed. The location is also perfect for doing any sort of activities nearby.
14266085,237118511,2018-02-21,23426096,Cathy,"We usually pack a lot of stuff before heading over to stay at an Air BnB.  This time, nearly half of the stuff I brought was unnecessary.  This house is fully stocked!  It had everything we needed for a more than comfortable stay.  We LOVED the layout of the house.  It's small, without feeling cramped, and it's completely cozy.  The living room was the BEST!  In the day time, it got so much beautiful lighting, it was bright and spacious.  At night, the awesome lamps in the room bathed the room in a golden glow that was SO comfortable.  There are 3 full size couches, so there was plenty of seating for my little family where we could just sprawl and lounge. The two bedrooms and the bathroom are at the opposite side of the house, and we really appreciated how separate everything was from each other; you had the sleeping/bathing area, you had the kitchen/dining/laundry area, and then you had the living area.  The bedrooms are VERY close together, which gave us peace of mind as our 5 year old was staying in the smaller bedroom.  The bedrooms couldn't have been more cozy.  We stayed during a cold snap, so we ran the heater most of the time, and it was perfectly sufficient.  NOTE:  I had difficulty running the hot water in the shower.  Joy was very patient trying to solve my problem, and after talking to the owners, she informed me that you have to turn on the hot water just a tiny bit, not full blast.  And that worked every time.  So take note of that if you have problems with the hot water in the shower. 

Anyway, we loved this place so much, I'm about to book it again for our next vacation, in 2 months!  We have stayed in a good number of places in Pacific Grove, and this one is by far our favorite."
14266085,240455634,2018-03-04,46299527,Asia,"The location is INCREDIBLE! We walked to the beach (takes just a minute) in the morning and saw a big school of dolphins. There were 4 deer roaming the street and munching on the neighbors gardens. The house is very quaint. It’s a tight squeeze but the location can’t be beat. Wonderful hosts, let us check in early. Lots of coffee and tea supplied. Would definitely revisit next time we need a spot near Monterey!"

14266085,243937167,2018-03-17,12098230,Nicole,"Amazing location, cute little house. Great amenities. 
Cool that they have an ipod player with music on it. 
The linens are kind of cheap and scratchy, you would think for how much you pay you would at least get better sheets (that is my only complaint!).
Otherwise, I would stay again and bring my own duvet!!"
14266085,246072421,2018-03-24,25825496,Megan,"We were in walking distance of a ton of places, including a great park and the aquarium. The place was just big enough for 4 people, nice and cozy. The only thing is that the bedrooms were much cooler at night. The heater in the main room helped but if the doors were closed, no heat would get into the rooms."
14266085,250625972,2018-04-05,166218655,Dawn,Perfect location.  Great place with all the amenities we needed.
14266085,250946480,2018-04-06,12431672,Kathy,"We had a wonderful stay in this lovely cottage! It’s very warm, comfortable and cozy. We were only there for one night, and wish we could have stayed longer! The location was unbeatable , truly steps from the sea, and within a spectacular walk to the aquarium, restaurants, and fun. Thank you so much for helping create wonderful memories on a very happy family getaway!!"
14266085,252448557,2018-04-10,73657652,Michael,Very nice little house. Great location and very clean and comfortable space. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to our next visit to Pacific Grove.
14266085,252949636,2018-04-12,180572329,Trina,The perfect sea side get away! So clean and cozy! Viveca and Jim did a great job offering tips for our trip! Perfect location to walk to lovers point and the aquarium! Thanks again!
14266085,254104662,2018-04-15,9291995,Jon,A quaint cottage one block from the coast.  Perfect for a laid back weekend.  Quiet and residential with plenty to do within walking distance.  Pacific Grove is a great small coastal town.
14302227,96620565,2016-08-23,57177886,Carol,The townhouse was great. Full kitchen and all small appliances.  The location is perfect. You are 5 minutes from the beach and 10 minutes to downtown Pacific grove or Monterey.   You are really close to 17 mile drive also.
14302227,97161648,2016-08-26,47683489,Åsa & Pär,"It was easy to communicate with the host in order to get the reservation done. The townhouse was placed in a quiet vacation area in beautiful Pacific grove.  
Sheets and towels included.

We had a nice couple of days in Monterey area.

14302227,98091462,2016-08-29,18118506,Nick,"Karolien was responsive and helpful throughout the entire process. The property was well-maintained and as-described, with all of the necessary amenities and space for our group of five. The property is a short walk/drive to a main commercial strip with views of the water. We had a great time in Pacific Grove and recommend staying with Karolien!"
14302227,185784385,2017-08-22,32935151,Juliana,A super responsive and helpful host! Great spot!
14388930,131922009,2017-02-14,1610707,Jason,"Ric and Margaret are very nice and welcoming.... warm energy and their gardens brought a sense of calm that brightened each moment of the day and night. 

The house is as described and its very close to Asilomar, ie secluded.  It's the ""further away"" part from town (a 12 min walk still), but that's what we were looking for.  This house is perfect for a couple and if I come to PG as a couple, I will look to stay at Ric and Margarets, for sure.  5 Stars, 10 rhinos and 18 birdies!
"
14388930,138413583,2017-03-19,118609480,Usha,Nice private clean and super comfortable room and common areas all perfect for two adults. Beautifully furnished and in a great quite street quite near to Asilomar beach and trails. 
14388930,141355730,2017-04-02,11152710,Daniel,"We were looking for a romantic weekend getaway, and Rick and Margaret's place was perfect. A short, pleasant walk to both restaurants and the beach, secluded and quiet, clean and well-appointed. They're completely accommodating and accessible, generous hosts. "
14388930,146723195,2017-04-23,44171330,Steve,"My only regret is that we only had 2 nights to spend in Pacific Grove.  Richard's place is in an ideal location - in a lovely, quiet neighborhood - that is only a 5-minute walk to the ocean and a nice 20-minute walk to downtown Pacific Grove.  Richard was a great host.  The house is very welcoming and the instructions he provided were very helpful.  For folks who want to be near Monterey without experiencing the whole tourist-scene should consider staying in this great place."
14388930,152082505,2017-05-14,18736000,Nancy,"Delightful stay.  The home is spacious and comfortable with cozy bed linens and towels.  Decoration is personal and character-filled but not overly-done, providing plenty of horizontal spaces and drawers for your own items.  The kitchen is well-outfitted with appliances, equipment and basics - check out the fridge and pantry before hitting the grocery store.
The entry garden was a treat with each entry and exit; we saw a new plant, flower, fruit every time through. The neighborhood is quiet and so pleasant with the rumble of the waves a few blocks away in the background.  Great for sound sleeping!
Rick and Margaret are the ultimate hosts - they made themselves available by phone, email or knocking on their door but did not hover.  A truly remarkable balance of guest privacy and care.
We walked to town (PG) at least once a day.  We walked to dinner in Pebble Beach at Spanish Bay (don't forget to go see the bagpiper close the Links at Spanish Bay outside of Roy's - order a cocktail and sit at the fire pit).
We loved this property and will be back.  "
14388930,156070857,2017-05-29,49646620,Lisa,"Beautiful home in Pacific grove and you can walk to Asilomar Beach.   Relaxing  home with comfortable bed,  nice
shower, full kitchen and lovely garden."
14388930,159823022,2017-06-11,13651650,Susannah,"Rick's place is the getaway you need! My husband planned a small trip for my birthday weekend to the Monterey/Pacific Grove area and this spot was perfect. First of all, the space you get is larger than we would have expected. Tons of areas to enjoy, and many books to read (many I didn't get time to even look at). You are a short walk to the beach and a short drive to the start of 17 mile drive. It's a cozy and romantic place with so much thought put into it! My recommendation: explore the area, go to the beach, buy a bottle of bubbly, then relax on the couch and watch a movie. Play the piano too!"
14388930,166200805,2017-07-02,83336831,Melissa,Very comfortable and quaint home. Richard is a great host!
14388930,173733352,2017-07-23,11110623,Sydney,"Loved this relaxing, clean, cute seaside getaway! Highly recommend."
14388930,179512677,2017-08-07,643248,Mark,"This place is lovely. Warm, cosy, homely.  Great location - super quiet, 5 min walk to the beach, lovely gardens. It is equipped with everything you will need in your home. The hosts are lovely, kind, warm and generous. A delight all round. The hosts went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable."
14388930,185388910,2017-08-21,13522590,Christine,"We were in the Monterey Peninsula for car week and Pacific Grove was a prime location for us.
Rick's property is delightful from the beautiful gardens that lead to the cottage to the thoughtfulness of every appointment in the cottage.  It is incredibly clean, well maintained and outfitted to meet your every need.  The space has lots of light with tile, hardwood and carpeted floors, a library of books and interesting art and sculptures throughout.
Rick is super accommodating and even provided a bucket and rags so we could put the finishing touches on our car prior to showing it in Concourso Italiano. He also made folding camp chairs available to us to make our car events more comfortable.   We would definitely return to this centrally located yet quiet and relaxing environment."
14388930,192587990,2017-09-10,52106138,Alev,"This is a beautiful guest house with many fine touches in a lovely, quiet residential neighborhood. Richard and Margaret are very welcoming and gracious hosts."
14388930,195289778,2017-09-18,126351505,Jeanne,Beautiful home in a fantastic location. The cottage is adorned with lovely art work and antiques. The gardens are also great and we enjoyed fresh tomatos provided by the host. Easy walk to the beach. At Asilomar.  Highly recommend.
14388930,209984443,2017-11-06,152527740,Richard,"Everything was perfect and the beauty of the property really exceeded our expectations. The casita is in a garden like setting, private,  quiet, with numerous trees and shrubs.  We were struck by the cleanliness, the art work and attention to detail in almost every room. It only took us about five to ten minutes to walk to the ocean. We are already planning a return trip."
14388930,211837065,2017-11-14,8867723,David,"An absolute gem! I had a lovely weeklong stay at Richard & Margaret's place and would definitely recommend. Clean, quiet & a nice five minute stroll from the water. Richard & Margaret were great hosts."
14388930,230728793,2018-01-28,21555285,Pamela,"A very special place!  Perfect location, spotless, charming, and wonderful hosts.  We stay at a lot of airbnbs and this ine is spectacular!"
14388930,236255797,2018-02-18,166016216,Judith,Staying here is like living in your own private English cottage near the ocean.
14388930,242901125,2018-03-13,128133207,Bob,"The place is nicely appointed with plenty of space.  The location is perfect, a few minutes walk to the beach.  The walking path at the beach goes forever.  Richard and Margaret could not have been more hospitable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
14388930,251311182,2018-04-07,22631742,Leslie,"We truly enjoyed our stay, the home is very welcoming and comfortable. The antiques, fireplace, art, pictures, and books all added to the ambiance. The garden is lovely, attracting lots of hummingbirds. We look forward to returning in the future. Thank you for sharing your home!"
14403615,96065723,2016-08-21,1103191,Craig,"The Dolphin House is a true gem.  Simply said it's AMAZING.  You want for nothing as everything you could imagine is provided for. Quiet, spacious, cute, adorable, clean, incredibly convenient to anything on the Peninsula, plenty of parking..I could go on.
I can't wait to come back to The Dolphin House.  Beverlee is fantastic.  Thank you!"
14403615,97739297,2016-08-28,63295550,Sarah,"Upon arrival there was a care taker there to help us get in and tell us about the area and what there was to do with little kids. He was very kind and knowledgeable about the whole city. The house came with two free passes to the Aquarium, which was amazing and a must see when in Monterey. 
The only complaint I had were the neighbors. They would stay up late and because the houses are very close together you could hear them very clearly even when they weren't loud, thus I had a hard time sleeping. Other than that it was an great experience.

"
14403615,99409408,2016-09-04,90143897,Leo,"We had an amazing stay, made possible by a wonderful home and host. Beverlee keeps and amazing home, the pictures don't do it justice. Everything was clean and ready from day one. The third bedroom is upstairs with separate entry, this was perfect for our teen daughter. This gave us an our guest adult time and gave her her privacy. The location is 15 minutes walking distance from the Monterey Aquarium and the two guest passes saved us $100, great little perk. Would use the dolphin house again for future Monterey/Carmel trips."
14403615,101272249,2016-09-12,4162844,Kyle,"Beverlee was communicative, kind and responsive. The neighborhood was quiet and had beautiful views of Pacific Grove. The house was immaculately decorated, clean and had a really helpful binder of where to eat, and what to do around town. "
14403615,102918078,2016-09-19,35974491,Schumin,"We had a great stay at the Dolphin House.  The kitchen was well stock with cookware, but if you plan to cook a lot, you may want to bring your own spices.  Enjoyed being able to walk to the Aquarium along the coast.  The house was clean and well decorated and we enjoyed walking around the neighborhood.  In the evenings we really enjoyed having the fireplace.  "
14403615,104065935,2016-09-25,80524626,John,The house was great! The third bedroom upstairs was like having a second rental. Very close to lots of fun things to do
14403615,104462147,2016-09-26,15809599,楠,"超级赞的一家,很热情的主人和mannager.家里超级干净,餐具齐全,交通便利,自己做饭很赞。
Fantanstic experience!The house is relly clean and beautiful,furitured with excellent things in kitchen and bathroom."
14403615,105721945,2016-10-02,89942339,Sagar,"We had a great time here. The entire house was sparkling clean and in perfect condition. The location was really convenient to walk to restaurants. Lover's Point was just a 5 min drive from here. All amenities were included including loads of clean towels in the bathroom. Detailed directions for operating the gadgets in the house were also provided. We never felt the need to contact the owner.

The only thing I have a complaint about is their strict check out time. We were running late because of the long wait time at a nearby restaurant, so we called Frank, the caretaker, to request to extend the check out time by an hour. But he was not even willing to extend it by 30 mins as they had another party checking in at 4pm that day. I can understand that they need to prepare the room for the next group but it's hard to believe that they would need an entire 5 hours to clean the house. They could've been a little flexible with the check out time considering that 11am was already early compared to most hotels. We were totally not expecting this to happen, so we had to rush out of the restaurant in a hurry to pack and leave. When we were about to check out, Frank showed up at exactly 10:55 am as if to make sure we left on time. It felt like we were not trusted. 

One word of caution about the driveway - please be very careful with cars that have low clearance. Our Nissan Altima got a long and nasty scratch at the bottom (in between the front and rear tires) because of the sharp bend on the driveway. You'll notice tons of scratches at the driveway entry probably made by other guests like us."
14403615,107501609,2016-10-10,87516191,Kat,"Everything was great: neighborhood, property, amenities. Home was clean and comfortable and was what we needed for our trip. The aquarium passes were a nice bonus. Pictures don't do it justice. "
14403615,108617313,2016-10-16,26484427,Gillian,"We had a wonderful experience staying here. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the house and how nicely it was decorated. The location was great, an easy 15 minute walk to Lover's Point, and an easy 10 minute walk to restaurants. The two aquarium passes were used and much appreciated! "
14403615,113976466,2016-11-14,65776443,Kirsten,Beverlee's home is fantastic. It is such a cozy space with all the amenities in an amazing location. It was easy breezy to find and it was great to be so close to Cannery Row and the beautiful ocean. 
14403615,114596450,2016-11-19,50618642,严,Perfect House at perfect place!I will introduce the house to my friends!
14403615,115326689,2016-11-23,10876894,Gwen,"Beverlee the owner and Frank the caretaker were both very responsive and helpful. Seamless check in and check out. House was immaculate - very clean! All 3 beds very comfortable. House was cozy and well-supplied. Lush towels. Everything worked. Great to have the Aquarium passes. Peekaboo ocean view from living room, and partial view on front stoop. Only issue is the driveway does have a steep slope and would recommend anyone with a low clearance car to simply park on the street. "
14403615,115570623,2016-11-25,79159868,Eva,"Our first experience with AirBnB was the Dolphin House and we loved it! The quiet, convenient location and the beautiful, immaculate home made our Thanksgiving holiday memorable. The host is prompt, helpful and informative. We will definitely recommend the Dolphin House to anyone who is looking to spend a pleasant vacation in a cute and cozy home at the lovely Monterey Bay. "
14403615,116069553,2016-11-27,94889204,Matt,"Nice house in a central location. 2 bedrooms with queen beds downstairs and a separate unit with 1 queen upstairs. Our family of 5 stayed downstairs and Auntie stayed upstairs with the kids going up to wake her in the morning ;) and coffee time for Mom and Dad. Well equipped kitchen. TV/Xfinity/WiFi. 15 min walk to the aquarium, 10 min walk to downtown Pacific Grove. Parking in the driveway and the street did not seem too busy. I would recommend staying there. "
14403615,126003969,2017-01-08,85562740,Tony,Great little house with a cozy gas fireplace. Separate upstairs unit must be accessed from outside which is great for privacy if needed. 
14403615,130835992,2017-02-08,35031753,Bruce,"房子很好找,有停车位,房间应该是刚装修完没多久,楼上稍微有些味道,总之一切都挺好!!"

14403615,141577127,2017-04-03,11489801,Caitlin,"The house was perfect for our group of 3 generations that came to Pacific Grove for a family reunion. A family of 3 and grandma were in the 2 bedroom house, and me, my husband and our infant were in the studio upstairs. The layout was perfect for a group of this size, very comfortable. We were able to enjoy a group dinner outside, using the barbecue. There were plenty of kitchen tools to prepare meals, lots of spices and a few condiments. It's very close to downtown Pacific Grove, and we were able to walk to the market for our groceries. And, we took walks to Lover's Point beach and restaurants in Pacific Grove. 
The driveway will scrape most cars that aren't high clearance--pay attention to host's warning about this!!"
14403615,143867221,2017-04-13,67481754,Eric,"Five of us enjoyed four nights in beautiful Pacific Grove in this quaint beach house. Location was fantastic -- a relatively easy walk (there are some hills to contend with) to the aquarium and Lover's Point. The house was the perfect size for the family. The upstairs studio was fully equipped with a kitchenette and small bathroom. Beds were comfortable and the home and kitchen was well stocked. We forgot our beach towels and we're pleased to learn there was a stash of some in the closet. Overall, a great place -- can't want to come back!"
14403615,146735945,2017-04-23,98981117,Ernesto,"This is within walking distance to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, grocery stores, and great restaurants. It is a quiet neighborhood to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. The living room and kitchen are great for cozy, relaxing evenings with friends or family. Beverlee is quick to respond to any questions or concerns. She is a great host and made our stay easy to manage."
14403615,148340730,2017-04-30,1220928,Nathan,Our group of 4 adults and 2 kids loved our time at the Dolphin House. Bev is very organized and the whole process was very easy. Location was great for accessing all parts of Monterey and Carmel. Would definitely return.

14403615,153681679,2017-05-21,3721578,Diana,"We had a wonderful stay at the Dolphin House as 2 families with young children.  The location was perfect - easily walkable to downtown Pacific Grove, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the beautiful Coastal Trail.  We really appreciated the aquarium guest passes, how clean the house was, and thoughtful amenities like kid toys/books, ample kleenex, and a new kitchen sponge.   Communication with the host and caretaker for check in/check out were very easy.  We hope we can stay again next time we visit the area!"

Four adults comfortably stayed at the house, and you could have six adults there, no problem. 
Communication was very fast and easy, and checking in was simple too. 
We all highly recommend staying here, thank you Beverlee! "
14403615,161104561,2017-06-16,132509261,Lindsay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Dolphin House.  We were able to walk to see the ocean, Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

14403615,163159721,2017-06-23,18697528,Alexandra,"Beverlee's home was perfect for our group of six. Two slept upstairs in the little studio, and four in the main house. The kitchen and BBQ we're great. We love to cook and found everything we needed. Having g access to laundry was fantastic. We loved being able to walk to the beach and aquarium. We'd definitely stay again."
14403615,165081585,2017-06-30,120504855,Elizabeth,"We really enjoyed our stay at Dolphin House. It was larger than we expected, beautifully furnished and very comfortable for our family of 6. The kitchen is clean and well-equipped, we had a BBQ one evening and would have made more use of the patio area if the weather had been a bit warmer! The beds are really comfortable and it's a quiet neighbourhood so we all slept well. It's also in a great location, we strolled into Monterey to the Aquarium and shops and explored Pacific Grove and the coastal path on foot. It was an added bonus to have the Aquarium passes and we throughly enjoyed our visit there. Beverlee had provided some maps and general info on places to visit and Frank also suggested a number of places to eat out. We would have liked to stay longer!"
14403615,167156510,2017-07-05,105740906,Andrea,"We loved our stay in Beverlee's place.  A charming cottage.  Although small, the home provided us with extra space with the separate studio.

"
14403615,170519183,2017-07-15,122942503,Julianna,"This place is a true gem. GREAT for families since there are 3 queen size beds and everything you could need. Everything is within walking distance and they even include 2 tickets to the aquarium. Beverlee and the caretaker of the home were very prompt, responsive and hospitable. One thing to be aware of if you have small children, the bathtub does not have an anti slip mat, so if you have children in the bath you will want to bring your own. Other than that, this was a flawless stay! "
14403615,174686498,2017-07-26,7380233,Christopher,"We traveled to the Dolphin House with an 11-month old, and having the separate upstairs unit was great!  We just left the monitor in there, and were able to be as loud as we wanted downstairs without any concern of waking the baby.  Everything was clean and nice.  There was an issue with the garbage disposal, but they came and took care of it right away.  My morning runs along the bay were beautiful and calming.  And, as always, the aquarium was spectacular."
14403615,175360149,2017-07-28,57291939,Louise,"Really cosy and sweet home, within walking distance of the beach, aquarium, restaurants etc. Very nice touch with the 2 free aquarium passes and a very substantial file with lots of interesting brochures and information on the area. "
14403615,176198746,2017-07-30,55842481,Kelly,Great house!! Wonderful location. Comfortable beds. Studio upstairs was awesome for our group! Great weekend at the Dolphin house :)
14403615,180993434,2017-08-11,139206567,Laura,"The Dolphin House was the perfect location for our stay in Pacific Grove/Monterey, within walking distance of the aquarium and Cannery Row, and a short drive to local sites like the Asilomar State Beach and Conference Center, which was beautiful and a GREAT place for beach access with the kids.  The home is very well stocked- every time I thought to myself, I wish I had brought...I opened a drawer and there it was (sandwich bags, tupperware, etc.).  We found everything clean, well organized, and easy to find and operate.  The bedrooms are small, but we squeezed an extra full size blow-up mattress in one of the downstairs bedrooms to sleep two little ones, just had to move a desk to accommodate the air mattress.  The upstairs suite was a bit more quaint than the downstairs area, but the kids thought it was a great adventure."
14403615,182081928,2017-08-13,122766266,Mindy,Was a great location. Very roomy and quiet. Definitely would go back again.
14403615,185475662,2017-08-21,136590370,Tammy,Very clean; nice place to stay.  Great experience!
14403615,187287635,2017-08-26,134156438,Theresa,"Great home and loved the floorplan.  It was perfect for us; 3 separate bedrooms with a kitchen, dining room and living room.  If you like to walk, this is the place for you.  It's is about a block from the walking path that leads you to Cannery Row and Aquarium.  Great place to stay."
14403615,188554668,2017-08-29,28892031,Erina,"The house was as described - clean and cozy. The location was great - a couple of blocks from the ocean, about a 15-20 minute walk to the aquarium. From the aquarium, you can also catch the free trolley to the harbor and downtown Monterey. From our experience, it seems the caretaker of this property prefers to meet guests personally."
14403615,190696790,2017-09-04,13749173,Paul,"Fantastic experience. Dolphin House feels like a home away from home. The house is fully equipped with everything a traveller, whether individual, group or family could need, down to the smallest detail. Nice quiet, residential neighbourhood but a short walk to the Monterey Aquarium and Cannery Row. Great launch pad for exploring 17 mile drive, Bug Sur, Santa Cruz etc. Good off street parking, wifi, cable, washing facilities, BBQ. Could not recommend highly enough."
14403615,192618400,2017-09-10,144890200,Ann,"Great space for 5 adults.  Clean, beautifully decorated and well-stocked with household items. Upstairs separate studio space is a great stand alone private unit in itself.  Location was perfect walking distance to breakfast and coffee locations with closest being only ~0.25 miles away.  Aquarium passes (2) were invaluable in helping out budget wise and getting to visit the awesome jellyfish and sea otter exhibits.  Beverlee was easy to reach as well as the caretaker Frank.  Would definitely stay again if visiting Monterey again."
14403615,197187395,2017-09-24,12938884,Jesten,"This place was perfect for our group! We had 3 adult couples and it was just the right amount of room. The house has 2 bedrooms in the main portion and 1 with a separate entrance up a set of outside stairs. This was perfect for our group as my parents could have some privacy. The one thing to note is that the upstairs apartment area doesn't have a mirror near a sink so my dad had some issues shaving, but that's pretty minor. We loved hanging out in the living room at night and having an area where we could spend time together. We were too busy to check out the outside area out back but it looked pretty nice. The location is pretty close to Cannery Row and the aquarium passes were a really cool perk that allowed us to go check out the aquarium even when we didn't have a lot of time (and wouldn't want to pay full price). Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to anybody looking to explore the Monterey Bay Area."
14403615,199335525,2017-10-01,144354344,Stuart,Great house for the money. Close to all the activities. Our group thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
14403615,201628339,2017-10-08,152486674,Sean,Hands down one of the best vacation homes we have ever stayed in !! Highly recommended if your looking for a quiet place to get away. The home was perfect !
14403615,204376854,2017-10-17,917442,Delaine,"Great house and perfect location to explore Monterey, Pacific Grove , Carmel etc. Only 5 mins walk to the beautiful sea. Very comfy beds and loads of space for 6 adults and equipped with everything you need. Even a glimpse of the sea from the upstairs small veranda.  Frank the caretaker was really helpful too. We did not want to leave, a very special house in a beautiful area."
14403615,206314206,2017-10-24,4193383,Chris,Super clean and in a great location. Highly recommend.
14403615,208521728,2017-11-01,5343323,Ted,"Great place to sleep in comfy beds for three couples (one bedroom located on top floor accessible via outside loft). Great place to live for two couples (common spaces allows great hangout for two couples). Walking(!) distance to the waterfront, our favorite breakfast diner (First Awakenings), evening restaurants, the Aquarium, etc. Cosy common spaces includes fully supplied kitchen, dining table and living room with open fire place. Private parking for one large or two smaller cars. Flexible check-in, check-out, and communication with caretaker Frank."
14403615,209732419,2017-11-05,155965119,Marci,What an amazing stay!! Highly recommended!
14403615,211363849,2017-11-12,21789636,Nadia,"This place was great! A true gem.  My husband, daughter and I along with a few other friends stayed here the weekend of the marathon.  It is very cozy and inviting.  Beverlee and the care taker of the house Frank were also great and very easy to reach.  I would definitely recommend staying here."
14403615,227727069,2018-01-15,17560212,Andrea,We loved the location!! The house was perfect for the weekend.
14403615,242391243,2018-03-11,55404965,Tim,"Beverlee's place exceeded expectations. The photos do not do the house justice. It is spotlessly clean and spacious enough to fit our group of 5 easily.

All the beds were really comfortable, the downstairs bathroom was spacious, and the living area was great with plenty of seating. My wife and I stayed upstairs in the studio, which has a TV, heating, and a little kitchenette. The bathroom upstairs is definitely cozy - I am 6'2"" and I think any taller and I would have had trouble fitting in the shower, so do keep that in mind.

Location is great. 10-15 min walk to the Lover's Point area. 20 minute walk to Cannery Row. Walkable to DT Pacific Grove. 

Would absolutely stay here again if I was in the area."
14403615,244535635,2018-03-18,133160299,Lizzie,"Our stay at the Dolphin House was lovely. Our family of six adults and one toddler fit perfectly. The house is wonderfully located, walking distance to the aquarium! From the front of the house you can see the ocean. The house was clean and had everything we needed. The patio was great even though it was raining so we did not use it."
14403615,246616799,2018-03-25,28912227,Mimi,What a lovely home the Dolphin house is! Cozy and perfectly located.
14403615,247514651,2018-03-28,163849515,Hillary,Pics do not do this adorable place the justice it deserves. So cute!
14403615,250946056,2018-04-06,8694930,NOra,"The Dolphin house is a wonderful place to stay.  Frank, the caretaker, was very helpful in getting us oriented and giving us recommendations for local parks and activities.  Our kids loved the space and it was really nice to have the upper studio for our friend without kids to stay in!  The kitchen is very well stocked and the beds were comfortable. All in all, a great stay!"
14403615,252244118,2018-04-09,35655498,Giulietta,"Dolphin House is just a few blocks from the sea. It's a gentle, seaside walk from there to Monterey Aquarium and other Monterey features. We saw seals on the beach, along the way. In addition to the fantastic location, the house was so comfortable. Roomy and clean, with everything we needed to cook with in the kitchen. I would love to stay here again."
14475122,99676742,2016-09-05,731879,Kelsey,"It was great, thank you so much! "
14475122,100497934,2016-09-09,3759430,Tom,"We received a rude accusatory message from the host on check out saying we broke a bed which was not to do with us. The description said it was suitable for 6 people and this was certainly not the case. It is clearly for two couples with no additional sleeping space or pull out beds. There was building works still going on whilst we were staying. The price was over priced for something that is still a work in progress. There was no manual on the house so we could not access internet. The location is beautiful and the Windows wonderful, but the experience was marred by the above which has lead to me leaving my first negative review. "
14475122,141354358,2017-04-02,123449441,Ken,"This place was fabulous the view was worth $1 million! you're right across the street from the beach, the ocean, tide pools.  Beautiful sunsets every night. You're a mile away from 17 mile drive which is beautiful to take right into Carmel and spend the day. You are super close to Monterey Bay aquarium and cannery row. We had an incredible stay! thanks happy"
14475122,141585047,2017-04-03,40173248,Edward,Great house with great view and location
14475122,143412443,2017-04-11,123519746,Michaelangelo,"Happy, the person managing the property, was very easy to communicate with. Happy was very nice and was very quick to respond.

The house:
Location was perfect! The beach was across the street! The house was clean and the towels soft and were displayed beautifully.

The beds were extremely comfortable.

The view from the living room and kitchen is absolutely breathtaking. 

TV is 4k with smart functions. 

I would definitely rent this house again! 
"
14475122,144097121,2017-04-14,23038106,Lee,"Perfect. The location, the view, the house, code on the door made check in painless, every comfort we needed for 3 people to have an amazing few days."
14475122,145299915,2017-04-17,69298885,Kurt,Our priority was the view of the ocean and the proximity to tide pools for our kids - exceptional on both of these fronts!
14475122,147058015,2017-04-24,9149281,Ryan,"We had the best time at Happy's beach side paradise.  I mean how could we not with those views.  The home is perfect for a secluded get away weekend.  We felt like we were all alone on the edge of the world watching the waves crash on the rocks from the porch.  The house has been updated to have all the modern amenities.  The main living room has a huge window that looks right on the sea.  We sat there for hours watching the surf crashing.  Then we slept like babies to the sound of the crashing waves.  Happy is the kindest and most attentive host.  He's one of those guys that's always there if you need him and not there at all if you don't.  I will be coming back every year to this gem.  Thank you, Happy. You gave us a weekend we will never forget."
14475122,148473585,2017-04-30,17126277,Amy,"The view from this place is phenomenal! It was a very comfortable stay, and we would definitely go back!"
14475122,149349281,2017-05-03,126688792,Morgan,"We had the most relaxing stay in this home on the ocean! It was perfect for our family of four! We spent our days on the beach and exploring Monterey and Carmel and our nights cooking fresh seafood from local markets. The view from the porch is everything!! With two young children, it's hard to travel and be comfortable and we felt so at home here! Thanks Ash!! "
14475122,150710183,2017-05-08,50689760,Christine,The location was amazing !  You could not get better than that location.  I think that the place was great and maybe a little tired. 
14475122,155810492,2017-05-28,123759493,Blake,This property is absolutly beautiful. The location could not be more perfect and the view is absolutly breathtaking. The owner communicated very well and was very nice. Easy to find and many things to do in the surrounding area. Highly recommend. 10/10 
14475122,166861932,2017-07-04,83742506,Amy,"Like others have said - location, location, location.   You really can't beat this one - views are great and very peaceful - the bay is right there and you can walk all along the bay - on the road, on the trail, on the beach!  We even walked to the Fishwife restaurant one evening - just a 15 minute walk!   

House has 2 nice sized bedrooms and beds were comfortable.  If you need more than that you have the pull out couch.   

Would definitely rebook in the future. "
14475122,173643576,2017-07-23,55986003,Beth,"What a lovely place! Right on the beach. Just walk across the street to enjoy  Asilomar State beach (sandy beaches, tide pools, scenic vistas). The place is nicely outfitted. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen......the best view I've ever had in any kitchen! The host was very easy to work with and communicated well with us."
14475122,175369506,2017-07-28,132883812,Carol,"Lovely, small beach cottage with fabulous views, deer in the yard, quiet, and private."
14475122,177426644,2017-08-02,71932750,Padraic,Didn't want to leave!  Pictures don't do the house justice. So tranquil and amazing views. We can't wait to go back!
14475122,186874693,2017-08-25,77733907,Javier,"You will not want to leave, ever!   Greatest place.   Owner is a great at fast communication.  House is spotless and very cozy.   Location is unmatched.   Everything is there for your relaxing vacation."
14475122,188540604,2017-08-29,139760178,Benjamin,"The location was really great, it was very nice right near the ocean."
14475122,190663651,2017-09-04,636463,Jennifer,We loved our time at this beautiful home!!!  The beach access couldn't have been better.  The hosts were very quick to respond and were extremely helpful when called upon.  We will definitely come back and will tell our friends and family about this lovely vacation spot!
14475122,194902790,2017-09-17,123449441,Ken,"The house is great the location is even greater and Happy is very happy LOL 
 We stay here whenever we come to  The Monterey /Carmel area
 I would highly recommend this house to anyone"
14475122,196314538,2017-09-22,148942633,Cheryl,"The views in this home cannot be overstated! Stunning and so calming at the same time! The home is very comfortable and relaxing, the walk to the ocean couldn't be more convenient. You are far enough from road to feel private, yet you are just steps to the ocean. We enjoyed our visit so much we wanted to stay longer, but it was reserved already. Highly recommend !!!!"
14475122,205811211,2017-10-22,152498741,Teresa,"This is a perfect place for 2 couples, close to the beach and million dollar views. Quick response from the host and easy check in. We will definitely stay here again. It exceeeded our expectations."
14475122,213542340,2017-11-21,141616300,Nieves,Amazing location.  Doesn't get better than this.  I did not want to leave.
14475122,223095685,2017-12-31,139177137,Paul,"Fantastic location and a really well equipped place, we stayed 4 days just before new year 2017, 2 adults, 2 kids and a dog, plenty of space and very relaxing, we could not fault our Monterey break."
14475122,236581757,2018-02-19,20438912,Nipun,Amazing views!
14475122,238415221,2018-02-25,36395055,Janell L.,Perfect location with a view of the ocean from everywhere in the house! Clean and simple and close to everything!
14475122,251326703,2018-04-07,109687564,Chris,"the property holds an incredible position on the sea front with a clear outlook across the beach to sea. the kitchen living space works well with a kitchen bar eating area with raised stools to sit, the kitchen is well supplied. beds were comfy and accommodation clean and tidy; the property had a slightly dated feel especially the bathroom, but that didn't impact our stay. we had a few minor issues that were dealt with immediately by the landlord."
14539067,96000924,2016-08-21,86804770,Hannes,"It was a pleasant stay at Dee's apartment. We have been supplied with fresh fruits and cakes every morning !
Great hospitality
Thank you"
14539067,115568026,2016-11-25,50584256,Thomas,"We never got a chance to meet Dee, but the check-in process was extremely easy and she did everything possible to make sure we had everything we needed/wanted for the duration of our stay. The listing itself is very comfortable and private, and was perfect for my fiance and I.  Fantastic host and listing."
14539067,117053931,2016-12-04,2273725,Emily,"I was in town for a conference at Asilomar, and had a lovely time staying 2 nights at Dee's house. It is convenient to the conference grounds, and only a short way from town. The studio is spacious and comfortable, with a mostly private entrance. I didn't feel like I was sharing a house at all, and found it to be very quiet. The Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary is adjacent to Dee's property, which was amazing! "
14539067,123793519,2016-12-30,2445791,Daniela,"The location of this place is beautiful and Dee is an excellent host, trying to accommodate our interests and travel needs the best way possible. Thank you for a very pleasant stay."
14539067,124397956,2017-01-01,55984926,Katrina,Great place!!! 
14539067,127248244,2017-01-16,7251171,Ryan,"Dee's place was great! Dee was very communicative and offered us great tips on what to do, where to eat, etc. The apartment is a spacious studio with a little kitchenette that served our purposes perfectly. Dee provided us with a loaf of banana bread which was delicious and a few yogurts which we ate to start of our days, but there were plenty of other restaurants a short drive away if we had decided to go brunch. The neighborhood is quiet and secluded, but again everything you could want in terms of restaurants, nightlife, scenery, etc. is a short drive or walk away. We had a blast, would definitely recommend!"
14539067,131604931,2017-02-12,57057401,Sarah,"Dee was the host with the most, ensuring we had a seamless checking and providing us with sweet touches like homemade banana bread and aquarium passes.

The location of her place was close to many attractions in Pacific Grove. I'd certainly recommend her place for people traveling to the area!"
14539067,133152624,2017-02-20,69115189,Chad,"Dee's place is in a great location regarding all there is to do in Monterey, Carmel and the surrounding national parks. Accurately priced and included some sweet bonus perks! Thanks for everything"
14539067,140768020,2017-03-31,76372088,Jeff,"This place was very gorgeous, and very comfortable. Dee was very considerate, made sure we could reach her easily and really made sure we were having a good time. We went here for a conference at Pacific Grove Conference Center, and this was walking distance and a much more enjoyable stay."
14539067,141355388,2017-04-02,15682316,Kent And Cindy,"Dee’s “treehouse loft” was perfectly adorable, tastefully appointed, and the location is the big selling factor. It is about 1 mile from the beach - and the walk/bike path that weaves from Lover’s Point - Monterey, to the end of PG (Pacific Grove) Asilomar. It is also a short walk to a local walking trail in the neighborhood, and sits next to the Monarch Sanctuary. Monterey Bay Aquarium, shops, and restaurants are a mere 5 - 8 minute drive. 

The neighborhood is extremely quiet, so quiet that the only “noise” you hear is the lulling, crashing sound of the waves on the coast – and as I was drinking my coffee early, gazing out the window, four deer were carefully crossing the street – pure beauty and peace! 

Dee was easy to communicate with, quick to respond to our emails and the directions to access the room were clearly written and easily understood.  All the amenities included were very, very nice: fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee beans and grinder, oatmeal, and we were fortunate recipients of warm, freshly baked cinnamon rolls one morning, a special treat! The bed was extremely comfortable, the entire room, kitchenette, bathroom and eating area were impeccably clean; my husband and I would definitely stay here again – one of the best experiences we have had so far with an Airbnb host and room. 
 
"
14539067,142328494,2017-04-07,17972565,Craig,"We stayed with Dee for a conference at Asilomar. Our stay was easy, comfortable, and quiet--exactly what we were looking for! Dee was very responsive and helpful, and we would definitely stay with her again!"
14539067,146735789,2017-04-23,78356249,John,"Dee was extremely helpful both prior to and during our stay. The studio is extremely comfortable, and Dee even took it a step further with the added touch of fresh ground coffee, fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal provided for breakfast. She also left us fresh cinnamon rolls the morning of our departure! One of our favorite things about the place was opening up the windows and listening to the ocean in the distance. Highly recommended and will stay again in the future."
14539067,148364710,2017-04-30,48505950,Cindy,The pictures don't do it justice! The studio is quite lovely and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a more intimate stay in the Monterey region. Breakfast goodies were also provided along with guest passes to the aquarium. Thanks Dee :) 
14539067,149337159,2017-05-03,3258615,Aggie,"The furnishings are modern with good supply of linens and sensitively placed windows and skylight for daylighting and views. We loved the fresh coffee beans, yogurt, and we used the aquarium passes daily. 
This studio apartment is only accessible by a spiral staircase suitable for hearty individuals. Taking heavy suitcases up and down can be a challenge and slip resistant tape applied to the treads would help with sense of safety. Shower and toilet room were small but hosts were very responsive and helpful overall to our needs."
14539067,150889039,2017-05-09,25967793,Peter,"We absolutely loved staying at Dee's place on our road trip down the coast. Of all the city's we visited (Monterrey, Pacific Grove, Carmel By The Sea, Santa Barbara, and LA), we liked Pacific Grove the best. Our favorite part of the trip were our morning treks down to the little main street for coffee and people watching. Dee's place is in a perfect location, 5-10 min from downtown Monterrey, 10-15 min from downtown Carmel, 5 min from the Monterrey Aquarium, 5 min from downtown Pacific Grove. Dee even went above and beyond by grabbing two free guest passes to the Aquarium ($100 value total) so we could spend an afternoon laughing at the sea otters. 

The apartment was exactly as advertised. Despite it being attached to the main house, we had a ton of privacy and felt like we were staying in a totally separate apartment. Everything was exactly as advertised and pictured. We wouldn't hesitate to book this spot again on our next trip down the coast."
14539067,151239927,2017-05-11,24798065,Christa,It was just what I needed for some time away. It was very clean and the free aquarium pass was awesome. Would definitely stay again. 
14539067,152324748,2017-05-15,55682972,Sam,"Dee's space was great!! The space has a separate entrance so there was a lot of privacy. It had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay, including a mini kitchenette, nice breakfast nook with a table and two chairs, a couch, TV, and a warm, comfortable bed!  The room itself is light and airy and was quite roomy and bright (there are skylights). The location is pretty central between Monterey and Carmel in a nice quite wooded neighborhood. It was a lovely setting. Dee went above and beyond and lent us her guest aquarium passes which was awesome!! Check in/ Check out was super easy.  Highly recommend this spot!!
"
14539067,154283241,2017-05-23,12288693,Annie,"Highly recommended for solo travelers or 2 people. Dee converted the side of her house into small private studio. Think a large hotel suite with a bathroom and kitchenette. There's also a couch, TV, and small dining table. 

The location is amazing. If you're in Pacific Grove during monarch season, you just have to go a few blocks out to see the butterflies migrate. The studio is about 1 mile away from Asilomar Beach as well, and a few blocks down from the main arteries of the cute little town of PG. Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey are a short drive away.

Note: I'm a small person so I had no problem with the shower, but it is a stand up stall that will be hard for taller or larger people to fit into. 

Dee was very hospitable and kind. She checked in on me and was very responsive when I had questions. Sincerely enjoyed my stay.

This was a great value for my solo trip to Monterey Bay and I plan on checking Dee's availability next time I'm in town."
14539067,156463507,2017-05-30,120785422,April,"Dee's place was perfect & check in was easy. We were in the area for a wedding and Dee's place is right in between all the places we wanted to go. It was clean, had a coffee machine, a refrigerator and a nice bed. Thank you! "
14539067,165421027,2017-07-01,47157366,Yasmeen,Beautiful and serene space very close to the beach.  I agree with another reviewer that the pictures don't do it justice.  The hosts are lovely and have thought of every detail.  Definitely recommend staying there!
14539067,166856138,2017-07-04,22929314,Wendy,"We really enjoyed our stay in Dee's home. It was very clean and exactly as described. The bed was comfortable and the kids slept great on the futon.  She had oatmeal, yogurt, fruit and coffee which was nice to start the day. We were traveling with children and she gave us a good list of things to do while we were there and even had guest passes for the aquarium which was a highlight of our trip. This is a beautiful part of California and if we were ever in the area again we would stay with Dee!"
14539067,168633068,2017-07-09,42315985,Delia,Dee's house is so immaculate and is a walking distance to the beach.  I like her friendliness and is very accommodating. 
14539067,169486478,2017-07-12,30660749,Shaunna,"The studio was just as advertised. It was very clean and Dee communicated with us very well. We enjoyed the special perks, like free aquarium passes (!), breakfast treats,  and whole coffee beans with a grinder for a fresh cup in the mornings. Would stay again. A great deal."
14539067,171790761,2017-07-18,30495531,Drew,Great place to stay in Monterey. Very close to Pebble Beach and easily accessible to all the hotspots in the area. The place was very comfortable and clean and Dee and Chris were fantastic hosts. Would highly recommend to anyone.
14539067,172372280,2017-07-20,139705641,Tim,Great place and location
14539067,173131337,2017-07-22,68385768,Kristina,Dee is an excellent communicator and everything was as she stated in the listing. The aquarium is amazing and so worth taking advantage of the free passes. Thanks! 
14539067,174111927,2017-07-24,18595346,Tracey,"Great location, great host. Definitely would stay again."
14539067,174710836,2017-07-26,134161621,Sae Eun,"Dee was an amazing hostess! She was so kind and helpful throughout the entire trip. The space is small but there is everything you need. It's perfect for 2 people. The bed was comfy and the wifi was great. The only issues we had were the bathroom sink and shower being a tad bit small for my boyfriend but he's 6 feet tall so it shouldn't be too bad. The stairs are tight so just be careful going up and down but location, amenities, and hospitality are awesome! The two golden retrievers also said hi at night to us and they are very friendly and adorable which is a huge plus"
14539067,175389137,2017-07-28,36017911,Erika,"A quiet tree-house of a space, compact but very functional.  Dee has everything you need for a nice stay in Pacific Grove.  Easy check in and out- a great space for the two of us.  It was as advertised, and I would recommend staying here.  The passes for the aquarium are a bonus- and it was a treat to visit it.  Thanks Dee!"
14539067,179465684,2017-08-07,36658509,Jueli,"This place is lovely. Super clean, close to the beach and the Asilomar conference grounds. Perfect for my stay while attending a conference. Dee and Chris are extremely responsive, warm, and accommodating. Private entrance was a nice bonus. Felt free to come and go without disturbing anyone. Kitchen was a little limiting (only a fridge, microwave, and small sink), but doable. Natural light was bright and happy."
14539067,180980384,2017-08-11,14984174,Stacy,This place was great! Beautiful beach walks and Dee was fantastic! Loved the gesture of the passes to the aquarium! A very nice addition!
14539067,182064050,2017-08-13,71004629,Julien,Nice place in a quiet area
14539067,182909060,2017-08-15,8618755,Hannah,"My husband and I loved our stay at Dee's place. Check in and check out we're simple. The room itself was clean, private, and comfortable. We enjoyed being able to make coffee and watch the news while getting ready each morning. Tucked just the right distance away from the main street of Pacific grove,  it was quiet, but an easy drive to all of the local shops and tourist attractions in Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, and even Big Sur. 
The aquarium passes were an huge bonus! 
Dee is a great host, and I would happily stay here again."
14539067,183619618,2017-08-17,14937779,Charles,Fantastic!
14539067,185377887,2017-08-21,26972926,Brian,"Dee's place was absolutely perfect. It was as described, plenty of space, very clean, and location is excellent for easy access to everything on the peninsula. Dee was very responsive with communication and check-in/out was as easy as could be. I will definitely stay here when I'm back at the peninsula."
14539067,186149148,2017-08-23,105145019,Theresa,"Dee was a great host!  The apartment was in a great location; easy access to Big Sur, Carmel and Monterey.  The space was clean and Dee was very responsive/ friendly. The free aquarium passes are a HUGE plus!"
14539067,187878172,2017-08-27,18510710,Pierre-Yves,"We had a great trip! We especially appreciated Dee's communication, from an exhaustive list of things to do, to very clear instructions for check in and out. The place worked great for us, and we would definitely consider going back there if we come back to Monterey as it's hard to find a better value/location in that area for the price (plus the aquarium passes!)."
14539067,189121808,2017-08-31,115589470,Keith,A great place to stay in a wonderful location. Close to everything Monterey
14539067,190699741,2017-09-04,14095875,Elena,"A month before arriving to Dee's treehouse suite, Dee had messaged me via Airbnb to give me suggestions (tips from a local are always best!) about things to do. This helped me not only plan my trip, but also made me even more excited about my stay. Dee has exceptional communication- check-in/out went smoothly. Water is filtered; some fruits, yogurt, oatmeal and coffee were provided which made breakfast easy. Dee also put together vouchers for free appetizers at some of the nearby eats and two guest pasts for the aquarium (we could skip the line :)) ! My only wish is that we could have stayed longer. Didn't manage to make it through all of Dee's suggestions, but perhaps next time! Thanks for the awesome stay, Dee!"
14539067,191246367,2017-09-06,95236902,Erin,"We enjoyed our stay at Dee's very much - it is truly like a treehouse, with tall Eucalyptus outside the windows.  
One of the most comfortable beds ever! Also very quiet, as the unit is above a garage, so no footsteps from above.  
Excellent location - a stone's throw from the quaint shops and restaurants on Lighthouse, and just a few minutes to both Carmel and Monterey.
Also excellent internet and cell phone signal - we have T-Mobile, and have a lot of problems with lack of reception in areas of the peninsula.
Will stay her again!"
14539067,192600004,2017-09-10,14847653,Ceylan,"Dee's place was perfect for our quiet Monterey weekend. The space was lovely and clean, the bed was large and very comfortable, plenty of fluffy white towels. Dee was very easy to communicate with and always prompt. The location was perfect for us, everything we wanted to do was a few minutes drive away. Will definitely stay there again if we are in the area and have already recommended to friends."
14539067,193499641,2017-09-13,123787887,Liz,"Dee's place was tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood. The loft area was small but much larger and nicer than we anticipated! Dee provided breakfast food items during our stay, which was nice. The aquarium passes were also a plus. We would definitely recommend a stay here!"
14539067,194358682,2017-09-16,24405994,Tim,"Quiet street. Easy to find. Easy check-in and check-out. Clean, efficient and comfortable. Keep in mind, it's a second-story room. The bathroom is very small, but the main room is quite spacious and comfortable. Great location in Pacific Grove and easy to get to and from. Good jumping-off point for anywhere in the south Monterey Bay area: Carmel, PG, Monterey, Laguna Seca, Pebble Beach, etc."
14539067,195253661,2017-09-18,27334022,Los,Single room with ample space. Centrally located and a quick uber ride to just abiut anywhere. Room was clean and comfortable.  Bathroom a bit small but manageable for most. Will stay again if in the area.
14539067,195777779,2017-09-20,19117546,Amie,"We enjoyed our stay at Dee's place. Excellent communication, easy check-in and check-out. The bathroom is small, especially for tall people, but the rest of the space is very roomy. It's definitely a good place for the price. The aquarium passes were a very welcome bonus! 

Be aware that you need to pay an extra 10% tax on your arrival. We didn't read the fine print... not a huge deal, just FYI."
14539067,196296669,2017-09-22,66158961,Carmen,"Zeer mooie buurt en omgeving (strand op loopafstand en om de hoek bij 17 mile drive). De studio zelf was erg netjes en het bed sliep heerlijk. Mocht je behoefte hebben om te koken dan kan dat niet. Dee, de gastvrouw was vriendelijk en altijd bereikbaar."
14539067,197533678,2017-09-25,18232984,Alexey,"Lovely place with its charm. 
Thanks for the free Aquarium tickets!"
14539067,199367604,2017-10-01,59401236,Wendy,Great location and great host. 
14539067,201122223,2017-10-07,19517649,Daniel,"Dee's place is great. It is located nicely between Monterey and Carmel and directly adjacent to the beautiful 17-mile drive. Dee does a great job in ensuring her guests know all that the area has to offer with a very helpful welcoming email.

The apartment is perfectly adequate for a couple. The bed is comfortable and the apartment is clean. The only thing I would mention is that the kitchen is not fully-equipped (no stove/oven), so if you are looking to do a lot of cooking, this probably is not the right place for you."
14539067,202755477,2017-10-12,146459751,나은,It was convenient because it became personal space. It was clean and kind.
14539067,203282501,2017-10-14,384709,Marshall,Great place! Location was perfect. Place wasn’t huge but open studio with everything you need. Dee was great! Would definitely stay here again.
14539067,204571047,2017-10-18,139155231,Cat,"Dee’s darling studio was airy and well-lit. It was a cozy place in a cute neighborhood, perfect for my daughter and me.  The place included lots of little touches that helped us feel right at home. The location was pretty near the beach, as well as some wooded walking trails, and right around  the corner from the Monarch Grove Butterfly Sanctuary.  Our stay came with 2 passes for the Monterey Bay Aquarium which made our stay a super value. I would stay here again!"
14539067,205023619,2017-10-20,16830223,Kenneth,"We really enjoy Dee's place, clean and bright. Location is great. We Used her pass forthe Aquarium and had a absolutely wonderful day. Thanks Dee!"
14539067,208524974,2017-11-01,74386907,Taylor,Dee was very accommodating! So sweet to allow me free passes to the aquarium as well! Will definitely be back!
14539067,209205314,2017-11-04,153970553,Michael,"Clean, quiet neighborhood and friendly hosts"
14539067,213552131,2017-11-21,53093524,Albert,"Gorgeous room, easy check in and check out. Aquarium passes were a huge plus. We were right next door to the monarch butterfly grove, which has its peak season in November. Dee was thoughtful and communicative. A tip would be to bring an HDMI cable if you want to watch TV from your laptop."
14539067,214879036,2017-11-26,36673604,Tu My,"We had a great time staying here! The pictures don't do justice because the studio is a lot cuter than we expected, and super cozy. The room decor was very artfully arranged with plenty of natural light flowing in through the windows. All the amenities we needed were provided, and Dee added extra special touches by providing instant oatmeal, coffee, fruit, and yogurt, which is super awesome. Room comes with great WiFi as well. This place is located in a very peaceful and quiet area, so I especially loved the silence at night. Lastly, Dee was a very accomodating host, and we loved the free aquarium passes (which also comes with gift shop discount)! We had a great experience and would definitely stay again!"
14539067,216420073,2017-12-03,58324530,Jeff,A nice private space that's within walking distance to downtown and other attractions. Friendly and communicative hosts. Thanks for the great stay!
14539067,218014321,2017-12-10,43461885,Eric,Dee's loft is connected to her house and has a great location! Most major sites in Monterey were less than 15 minutes away from the place. Dee is a very helpful and gracious host!
14539067,218426549,2017-12-12,5134792,Nina,"We had a wonderful stay at Dee's place! Communication was prompt and detailed. The space was private, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood was easy to find, and there was plenty of parking available. As someone who appreciates a good cup of coffee in the morning, the coffee beans and grinder were a very nice touch. The location is ideal for exploring the Monterey area, and we thoroughly enjoyed using the aquarium passes. I highly recommend staying here and would love to return in the future."
14539067,220311258,2017-12-21,89876747,Eric,"Dee's place was just what we needed! Definitely worth the price when you factor in the aquarium tickets! A few things to be aware of though: the sink in the bathroom and the shower were both TINY. I had a hard time even washing my face in the bathroom sink because it was so small. Also, the heat takes a long time to warm the place (like several hours) after you turn it on so plan ahead for that. But the location was great and the place was cute. Dee also made us cookies which was a sweet touch."
14539067,226841170,2018-01-12,1613937,Fd,"I came here in January to attend a conference at Asilomar. Dee's place was clean, convenient (close to Asilomar and downtown), and quiet. Dee was extremely responsive and gave me all the information I needed. I would definitely stay here again! As other reviewers have noted, the shower and bathroom sink are quite small. It was okay for me (5'10.5) but might be inconvenient if you are really big/tall."
14539067,227725929,2018-01-15,45237023,Connie,"This was a perfect spot for a Monterey weekend.  The place was cozy and just the right fit for two.  Close to everything - the beach, restaurants, 17 mile drive, and the aquarium guest passes were an awesome bonus! So nice to speed by the line.  Dee was very communicative, flexible, and had lots of great tips.  Next time I'm in Monterey I will definitely look to book again!"
14539067,229067626,2018-01-21,166669755,Laura,"This was the perfect weekend getaway spot. It is well decorated, very clean, quiet, and has nice homey touches like snacks and a white noise machine. My boyfriend and I hiked in the Pinnacles one day and used the aquarium passes the next. Dee was very easy to communicate with and responded very quickly. I would highly recommend staying here and will keep it in mind for future visits :) "
14539067,230231537,2018-01-27,163737175,Ross,"I stayed at Dee's place with my wife and our two year old daughter while I attended a conference at Asilomar. Perfect location, a beautiful ten minute walk from Asilomar (the walking path along the old railroad line is ideal), and very close to everything else in Monterey/Pacific Grove. It's a small place, but was plenty for the three of us. Extremely kid safe, even though there's a spiral staircase(door and safety gate at the top of the stairs). Dee was very responsive and helpful with tips and ideas for things to do. And the aquarium passes are a great bonus. We'll definitely be back!"
14539067,231774558,2018-02-02,10239554,Jeanie,"Large, roomy, clean upstairs studio with extremely tiny bathroom and bed against wall, but a good value for the beautiful location & 2 free aquarium passes."
14539067,232425277,2018-02-04,31017143,Dawn,"Dees place is conveniently located to everything Monterey has to offer. The place was clean and orderly however much too small for our taste. We have used Airbnb several times and appreciate the hosts that provide us privacy.  However,  at least one interaction is something we have come to expect so that we can thank the host for opening their home or to ask questions about the stay or area. In this case Dee made no effort to greet us and that was somewhat disappointing for a super host.
All in all we had a wonderful time and the home is in an amazing neighborhood."
14539067,234155255,2018-02-11,169993503,Corey,"My very first time doing an Airbnb, and Dee set the standard high for any other place we may visit.  My girlfriend and I felt like we have known Dee our whole lives.  The location is beyond perfect, and the room was perfect size, and completely relaxing for or busy lifestyles.  Dee gave us great instructions on what we needed to do, and provided us many options to see and visit.  We both joke saying do think Dee would care if we just came here every week:). We have already recommended family and friends to seek out this wonderful tree house like room.  Oh and passes to the Aquarium made us feel like VIP’s, what a wonderful extra bonus to a beautiful weekend.

14539067,236901967,2018-02-20,132542870,Ashleigh,Dee and her family are awesome! The space is very nice and was nice to have all the amenities of a studio while on our vacation. Quick response on any and all questions we had and great tips on places to check out while we were there and of course the aquarium passes were amazing! Everything came as described and we had an amazing time. Thank you for the fresh baked cookies! 10/10 would totally stay again!
14539067,237377086,2018-02-22,101899690,Shyrie,"Dee’s place was easy to access, was clean and comfortable. There were plenty of amenities like wifi, fresh coffee, a mini fridge, microwave, cutlery, glass wear, wine and bottle opener. I expected the place to be smaller from the pictures but was pleasantly surprised by the size of the loft. It was very private and quiet. It is best suited for early risers because there's a wonderful skylight above the bed and a lot of natural light in the room. I would definitely stay here again."
14539067,238474534,2018-02-25,42230950,Alexandra,"We loved our stay! We had planned to take a romantic weekend trip to Monterey and visit the aquarium while we were there, so Dee's place seemed perfect. We had no idea how perfect it would be! Even if you aren't planning an aquarium trip, this place is ideal for an affordable trip to Monterey/pebble beach. There is so much to do and Dee provided great recommendations. One touch I particularly liked were the historical books on pebble beach that you can look through in the room. Knowing the history of the area made it feel so special to be there! Also the house is directly next to a monarch sanctuary, which was amazing! I'll repeat the phrase I read in another review that convinced me to book here-- 10/10 would stay again!"
14539067,239685303,2018-03-02,122190408,April,"First off, Dee always responded quickly and right after we booked our stay she gave us wonderful suggestions on things to do in the area. The place is beautiful and would reccomend to anyone."
14539067,240721518,2018-03-05,4151883,Trent,"We selected Dee’s home based on the free guest passes to the Monterey Aquarium, and were pleased with the location, cleanliness, and hospitality. Dee’s husband greeted us personally, and they even brought us home made flan one evening. We walked through the Butterfly Sanctuary next door and saw a deer, but were too late to catch the Monarchs. We’d recommend Dee’s place to others visiting Pacific Grove."
14539067,241564003,2018-03-09,36694750,Mei,"My husband and I stayed here for my bday trip. I have to say, I loved it. The passed to the aquarium was what sealed the deal for us. We were coming out here to go to the aquarium already so why not get it for free with your stay? 

Dee and her Husband were wonderful hosts. They have the most adorable golden retrievers and even gave us homemade banana bread. I liked that it was private and we have our own entrance. 

We are definitely coming back again. ♥️"
14539067,244559402,2018-03-18,20473648,Christine,"Cute studio, great location, wonderful local tips, nice walk in the Monarch Sanctuary next door, and the special touches of breakfast treats and aquarium tickets put it over the top!!!    We had a minor problem with the TV (probably because I bumped it) and the host was super responsive.   Thanks!!!"
14539067,245830781,2018-03-23,170094916,Steve,"Dee went out of her way to be welcoming and helpful—including unexpected snacks , helpful travel tips, and even umbrellas for rainy weather.  We lacked for nothing.  We really enjoyed our stay here!"
14539067,246976339,2018-03-26,39870383,Lorissa,"If you’re looking to enjoy Monterey for a couple days, this spot is centrally located to everything. There is a lovely butterfly park directly next to the studio where we saw deer both mornings. The bathroom is tiny but the essentials are all there. We were already planning to visit the aquarium so the free passes were an awesome bonus! I don’t think the tv is hooked up to cable, but we are not big tv watchers so it didn’t bother us.  Dee was helpful in suggesting local places and we had no issues the entire stay.  We had a great time in Monterey!"
14539067,250317976,2018-04-04,179880317,Kasen,"My family and I were looking to take our first trip to the Monterey/Pacific Grove area for spring break and we were on a time crunch to find a place to stay. We had never used Airbnb before, so we were already a little hesitant, but we found this space and knew it would be great for us! The listing only stated it was available for 2 guests, but my wife wrote to Dee and we received a very prompt response that same night letting us know our two kids (ages 7 and 4) were very welcome! We booked it right away! She also stated she would include some items in the room just for the kids which was a very thoughtful touch. We were very happy with the space and it was beyond our expectations and displaced any fear or hesitation we had about using Airbnb. The added benefit of the aquarium passes definitely sweetened the deal for us and made the rental that much better of a deal for us! Dee offered a lot of great suggestions for things to do during our stay in the area and those helped us plan our days. Also, on our last night there she even left a plate of fresh baked cookies! It was a very homey touch and rounded out our stay nicely!"
14629338,102922160,2016-09-19,13874275,Lou Ann,"Very sweet house in a nice neighborhood. The only thing we missed was being able to connect to the internet; however, we were on vacation so it was good to let that go for a bit! The host was very accessible by text and kept in good contact when we had questions. It was a perfect place to stay for the Monterey Jazz Festival, with only minutes drive away from Peninsula College where the parking was located. Would stay here again next year unless we have more people join us."
14629338,105810342,2016-10-03,83535575,Bonnie,"This house is a little gem.  It's quaint, clean and full of charming character.  In a really beautiful neighborhood.  Felt safe walking the streets at night.  Can't beat being one block from the water.  Will definitely be back when I can find the time.  The host responded to any questions almost immediately.  "
14629338,106892632,2016-10-08,92549164,Allison,"This little house was fantastic! The location was perfect for exploring Pacific Grove, Monterey, and the Big Sur coast. We walked or biked to shops and restaurants and loved the walking path along the beach. The house was comfy and welcoming and had everything we needed. No WiFi, which would have been nice, but we enjoyed checking out local coffee shops for getting connected."
14629338,113788595,2016-11-13,90695277,Mike,"Awesome house, we truly enjoyed our stay. The host was so accommodating and made it easy. This was our first AirBnB experience and it could not have been better!"
14629338,115168223,2016-11-22,71019922,Chris,A wonderful place to stay! The house is warm and inviting. The rooms are large and spacious. It is only a one block walk to the ocean and within walking distance to many wonderful places. The owner is fantastic to deal with and communication was very good. We would definitely go back and visit again. Thank you!
14629338,116797817,2016-12-03,17305709,Wendy,Mary gave us lots of great info about the area before we got there. Instructions were clear and the house was cozy and well situated. Would definitely stay here again.
14629338,120468802,2016-12-10,38005640,Helen,"Mary gave in depth instructions prior to arrival which made the check in process easy and smooth. The house was clean with every available amenity to make you feel right at home. The house was warm, cozy and in a perfect location, close to many shops, restaurants, and my personal favorite, YOGA! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  "
14629338,122177968,2016-12-21,12030444,Ann,"This is an absolutely charming, totally authentic Pacific Grove cottage, beautifully maintained and comfortable.  It is in walking distance of everything that PG and much of Monterey have to offer.  The layout makes it exceptionally well-suited for us--we have family in the area, and it was a pleasure to sit in the living room and chat at day's end.  The garden is charming as well.  "
14629338,128953611,2017-01-28,24679253,Megan,"This is a cute house in a lovely neighborhood. Everything was very accessible, and the water is close!"
14629338,129977893,2017-02-03,18203171,Megan,"Wonderful experience!! 
The location and value of this home was seriously unparalleled. It was about a block from a beautiful walking path along the beach and walking distance to everything that Monterey AND Pacific Grove has to offer. We spent time at Lovers Point, Fishermans Wharf, The Aquarium and The Monday Night Farmers Market in Pacific Grove just to name a few very close activities. 
The house was very cozy and clean with two bedrooms. Perfect for traveling families. There was wifi and we were able to stream movies. 
The host sent us a very detailed email of recommendations in the area which we referred to frequently and were not disappointed. All the details of the house were also clearly listed in the email and on a note in the house so we didn't have any questions or problems where we needed to contact the host. However, she was available and also had family in the area should we have needed anything. 
We highly recommend this home to anyone considering a trip to this area and we would rent it again in a second if/when we come back in the future. "
14629338,136143412,2017-03-08,9878611,Chris,"The Mermaid House is the perfect place for a long term stay:  comfortable beds, spacious kitchen, large bathroom with a tub for relaxing after a day of exploring the area, cozy living room, pleasant dining room and a charming patio with lovely plantings all around the house.  Location is fantastic for strolling downtown PG or walking the recreational trail along the beautiful Pacific Ocean to Lovers Point one way or the Monterey Bay Aquarium the other way.  Many wonderful restaurants close enough to walk, too, also.  The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet with local deer strolling the streets, at times, as proof.  The sun pours in the front of the house in the morning and all afternoon.  No cable was wonderful!  "
14629338,141340590,2017-04-02,13638443,Lynn,"We had a most wonderful visit!  The house is very comfortable and in a perfect location.  Mary gave us several suggestions for places to eat, things to do, etc."

Perfect location moments from the sea, lively house in great condition, very comfy & clean, very safe & quiet residential area. Mary was a great host, very helpful with great communication.

We loved being a block away from the ocean, being so close to the walking path that led to the beach and many shops/restaurants, and close to downtown. The house was just as described and we were very comfortable during our stay. We would recommend this house for anyone visiting the Monterey area and would stay here again if we're lucky enough to make the trip from Ohio again :) Thanks Mary!"
14629338,161763540,2017-06-18,65673912,Lawrence,Quaint and beautiful home.  Very quiet neighborhood and close to the coast and Lover's Point.  Can't ask for anything better in PG.  We plan to book this house on all our future trips to the area if we can.  Loved it.

14629338,187700660,2017-08-27,51264311,Michael,"We can't say enough about Mary's place.  For walkers like us, the beautifully appointed California bungalow is perfectly situated between Monterey and Pacific Grove downtowns, and a block from the bike path between Lover's Point and Cannery Row.  
We weren't able to fit our Camry rental in the short driveway, but that was not an issue at all, as there is ample street parking on Garden Lane, closest to the more convenient to the back door entrance.  
The aquarium passes are a huge bonus as well.  
A true gem of a BnB.  Thank you Mary!"
14629338,188805695,2017-08-30,98485374,Maria,"We had a very good experience at our first airbnb. The Mermaid house was beautiful, and in a perfect location. We were a few blocks from the beach and half a mile from the aquarium. We were able to use the guest passes provided and we walked to the aquarium one of the days. The neighborhood was very quiet and we even got to see some Deer, multiple times around the neighborhood. The house was very clean and has plenty of amenities. We were only able to stay for 3 days but wish we could have stayed longer. I will never stay at a hotel again! Thank you so much!"
14629338,191788280,2017-09-08,131069875,Janice,Location Location Location. We walked ever morning and night to the ocean. It was only one block away. We were close to up town and down town. Neighbors very friendly and a joy to watch the deer. I slept like a baby every night. I was worried about the bed. Very comfy. 5 Start rating for me.
14629338,193476834,2017-09-13,142506412,Susan,"Really comfy little place within walking distance of the beach, downtown Pacific Grove, Cannery Row and the aquarium. 

Clean, quiet, comfortable. It was our first airbnb experience and it was a breeze! 

Bonus: a group of deer sauntered by every day around 5! 

Would stay here again."
14629338,194976088,2017-09-17,3891901,Sam,Mary is a great host and her home is in a fantastic location near the beach and the town. She was quick to help when we had questions and even had the neighbour pop round when we couldn't work the shower (pull the ring under the tap down). Recommended.
14629338,197516571,2017-09-25,119000962,Libby,Great location and interesting home for scenic Pacific Grove.
14629338,209965865,2017-11-06,27437946,Timothy,"Wonderful and wellpreserved cottage within a seal's bark of the coast (yes, heard them at night) and an easy walk to the restaurants and stores of Pacific Grove.  For 2-3 people, perfect size and one feels at home immediately. 
Gives a strong sense of history of the area - so much better than a hotel!"

Right into Pacific Grove for shops and great restaurants. Walked up to the movie theater several nights. It is a quiet safe friendly neighborhood. The house is clean and very roomy with a lovely little garden."

14629338,250965047,2018-04-06,1577127,Joel,"Great location.  Bay and aquarium within easy walking distance for us old timers.  Harbor seals  were calving.  House and beds very comfy, and house and area unique for us.  Pacific Grove downtown had easy access.  We were very pleased."
14629338,253226658,2018-04-13,5075065,Tina,Love this adorable spot in Pacific Grove. Every morning we made ourselves coffee and strolled to the water to watch the sea otters. Best possible way to start the day. Very comfy home in a quiet spot -- but still in the middle of everything. How'd they do that?! We'll stay here again for sure.
14709038,102280324,2016-09-17,19976256,Victoria,"Lovely studio in a small complex near the coast. Was just a few mins drive from a choice of restaurants, a short stroll from the seafront and a gear location. Allocated parking right outside was super convenient and we were able to use the jacuzzi too! Bathroom was clean and modern."
14709038,102622341,2016-09-18,50696537,Peter,"The experience was great! This is a timeshare unit that caters more like a hotel.  Check in was super easy and convenient, the unit was perfect for a nights' stay and the overall feel of the community was great.  Very enjoyable experience and would stay again!"
14709038,193213083,2017-09-12,120792760,Pascale,It's a small clean place to stay. There is no air conditioning but everything else you might need is available.
14709038,194823029,2017-09-17,40978401,Chelsea,Karolien's place is a great value for the location and great if you prefer to do a little cooking while you're away.

14804837,106707741,2016-10-07,76655078,Paul,"This place was absolutely incredible. The house was so well designed and decorated. Straight out of a magazine. Honestly didn't even notice our host the entire stay. He was responsive to our questions and very polite. We would not hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend if this is your first time or if you frequent Monterey Bay or Pacific Grove to stay here. Location was convenient to food, aquarium, shopping.... The included aquarium tickets were a fantastic bonus. 5 stars indeed."
14804837,107668209,2016-10-11,8618993,Josh And Renee,"Ben's place is a gem and our family had such a great time staying in his guesthouse.  The house was tastefully updated and even more spacious than we expected; it was perfect for our family of four.  The house is a short walk to Lover's Point beach where we saw sea otters and sea lions and enjoyed walking the beautiful promenade to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  It was so nice to be blocks from all the cute cafes and restaurants in Pacific Grove.  We highly recommend Passionfish,  but I think next time we will get a babysitter so we can enjoy it more!  Ben's guesthouse is also a quick drive or nice walk to the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary.  October is still a little early, but we saw a tree full of the Monarchs and it was so cool!  We highly recommend this guesthouse and hope we can make it back again soon!!"
14804837,107970969,2016-10-13,19052468,Beth,"Great location for walking to the ocean, shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove and very close to the 17 mile drive. Comfortable beds and pillows, beautiful kitchen with nice kitchenware. Everything was as described. "
14804837,108289507,2016-10-15,6541136,Lauri,"Elegant, centrally-located spot to walk into town for cafes, shops & movies. We preferred heading towards water for walk along the beach & coastal trail. Kitchen & bathroom are freshly renovated and bedding & towels make for a very comfortable stay."
14804837,109633352,2016-10-22,94542400,Holly,"Ben and Heather's place is great!  It was very clean and nicely remodeled. It had everything my mom, sister and I needed and then some. The location is great and is within walking distance to restaurants, shopping and a really close coffee shop (Bookworks). It's just a few blocks to the ocean. Ben provided several recommendations of places to eat which did not disappoint. Parking is right out front of the house, and it's just a short drive to the lighthouse to watch the sunset and sea otters play in the ocean. The description and pictures were exactly as described. We had an amazing trip and couldn't have stayed in a more perfect place!  I would highly recommend this place for a relaxing trip to Pacific Grove/Monterey. Thanks you Ben and Heather!"

Everything we needed for a long weekend was in place.  We enjoyed it very much and definitely hope to book a return stay next year.  Ben and his family were friendly and very responsive to any questions we had.  The neighborhood is charming and a short pleasant walk to restaurants, shops, movie theater, etc.  We could not have been more pleased with the accommodations!"
14804837,111290007,2016-10-30,57819403,Holly,We had just a great stay! Monterey and the Pacific Grove and Carmel area are just beautiful and our location was perfect and easily accessible for each.

14804837,112635522,2016-11-06,6047412,Tara,"The duplex was clean and charming. It was very tastefully decorated with comfortable beds, a well stocked kitchen and very easy access and parking. The town of Pacific Grove is (Website hidden by Airbnb) close to Monterey but feels like a world away from the touristy Cannery Row. We'd love to stay for longer next time and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Beautiful neighborhood, so convienent, many restaurants near by..."
14804837,113957233,2016-11-14,67617383,Kayla,"Location is just at the end of all the shops and restaurants in pacific grove on lighthouse ave. Location was walking distance to the beach and matched what was advertised. If you plan on doing anything in Monterey and Carmel, be prepared for traffic. 2 miles can take up to 20 minutes in places. It took us almost a half hour to get to del monte shopping center. The house was very cute and the owner was helpful and quick to respond "
14804837,115735686,2016-11-26,39877459,Audrey,"This place is the best! Our family of four stayed here for a week over Thanksgiving to explore the many options in the area. The proximity to shops and restaurants is perfect - many within walking distance. The duplex is also within walking distance of the beach and Lover's Point. The second bedroom has one twin bed, but the host thoughtfully put a twin aero bed in the closet that fits perfectly beside the twin, so that two people can stay in the second bedroom. The kitchen was stocked too when we got there. Eggs, yogurt, cereal, PB .. we could make do for breakfast that first morning with what was there. Everything in the kitchen was tastefully labeled so you didn't have to guess where the (many) cooking items went. I would not hesitate to book this place again! Wonderful!"
14804837,116350627,2016-11-29,1327501,Shannon,Fantastic location a short walk from downtown Pacific Grove. Fully stocked kitchen and a wonderful space for a family traveling together. We stayed with my mom and our three year old and had a wonderful stay. 
14804837,116800691,2016-12-03,4598057,Jan,"It was a great location in Pacific Grove and the house is very well equipped and nicely remodeled. We were traveling with two toddlers and the house was convenient. Great kitchen, wonderful kid's books and toys. That was a great touch! Aquarium passes made it possible for us to do two half days... 
Thoroughly enjoyed our time there!"
14804837,120202861,2016-12-08,89241277,Liz,"Ben texted while we were on our way with entry code and let us know of his availability if we needed anything. The duplex was beautifully restored with period charm but also 'brand-new' spotlessly clean.  Perfect hybrid! Loved the simple rock and succulent landscaping. Very coastal.  The neighborhood was quiet and safe at the residential end of the little downtown, so also very walkable to shops and restaurants.  The central heating was very effective so we were quickly cozy on the chilly, damp days we were there.  Nice bed linens and towels.  Well -equipped kitchen. "
14804837,120937598,2016-12-12,53968089,Nicole,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at Ben's cozy duplex. It would be perfect for a family with kids too! The whole place is charming, clean, and spacious.
We plan on making this our go to place every time we come to Pacific Grove. 
Thanks again, Ben"

14804837,122311201,2016-12-22,26980079,Abby,This cozy gorgeous home was perfect for our family vacation. My 5 year old son loved this home as he had his own room and twin sized bed! We felt so comfortable here as it is similar to our own home. Everything was neat and easy to find. Perfectly labeled and organized. It is walking distance to so many wonderful restaurants and shops. We went to the aquarium because of the guest passes provided to us by Ben and his wife. Truly an amazing trip! Hope to come back soon! 
14804837,122467530,2016-12-23,103605060,Ana,The apartement is very nice!
14804837,122937900,2016-12-26,25005588,Maureen,"Wow, what an amazing spot!  If you have young kiddos, look no further.  Our 3&5 year old were very happy in the twin bedroom with aerobed, with us right across the hall in the extremely comfortable queen master. There's a great side yard completely gated in with lots of vantage points from windows so you can keep an eye on them. The hosts have spared no detail - the kitchen is impressively equipped, linens high quality and plentiful, and everything feels new, clean and modern, although the house is older with beautiful (and very functional) built-ins.  Although ""cozy,"" it's spacious enough for a family of four.  It's a short walk to a great playground and  a little further to a wonderful kid-friendly beach.  The aquarium is only about a mile away.  Lots of shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove are literally a 2-3 minute walk.  All in all, the perfect spot for our family of four. "
14804837,123326707,2016-12-28,48748433,Daisy,"Great place. The house is clean, well-decorated, well-equipped, including everything one might need during the stay. Location is convenient, close to one entrance of the 17-mile drive as well as the lighthouse.  Will recommend this house to everyone going to Monterey/Carmel area."
14804837,123791219,2016-12-30,54958093,Amy,The duplex was an easy and scenic walk to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  It offered my family of 4 plenty of space and the ability to cook our own meals.  Pacific Grove is a neat community and I'm glad we got to live like locals for a couple of nights.  Ben was a gracious and responsive host.  I would definitely recommend his place to other travelers!
14804837,124792397,2017-01-02,88533,Dominique,"We strongly recommend Ben's place, especially for those with kids!  We visited over New Years with our 8 month old and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.

+ Location location location! Literally a block away from the main ""strip"" in downtown Pacific Grove and a lovely 20 minute walk along the ocean to the aquarium.  We hardly needed our car during this trip and our daughter loved the walks in her stroller.
 
+ Aquarium passes! Between naps and feedings, our 8 month old was only good for about 1-1.5 hours per aquarium visit. With the passes, we were able to visit the aquarium every day (we only saw one or two exhibits at a time...something not possible if we'd had to pay the adult ticket price of $50 each, every time).

+ Adorable, newly renovated and comfortable. Ben's duplex is clearly well-cared for. It's newly renovated and has modern extras like a Nest thermostat (and central heating that kept us cozy in the winter), a new kitchen, (Hidden by Airbnb) Cast etc

+ Lots of kid-friendly extras! Toys, books, a Baby Bjorn crib, kid plates / utensils, a little red wagon...the list goes on. While there are lovely decorations, many are quite kid friendly and the more breakable items are thoughtfully stowed higher up :)

The neighborhood was perfect - we enjoyed walking to coffee shops and restaurants, down to the beach, and also to the Butterfly Sanctuary.  Ben's house is very comfortable and well organized.  We mostly cooked our own meals and the newly renovated kitchen was a pleasure to cook and eat in.  We also appreciated the thoughtful touches aimed at kids (perfect for our toddler son) including toys, children's books, and beach toys. Thank you for a great stay, we hope to come back again!    "
14804837,126037514,2017-01-08,29221024,Lisa,Beautiful vintage home with cozy charm and comfort. Ben and Heather had great communication throughout the experience as well. Awesome location close to everything you will want or need. Will stay again!!

14804837,127241592,2017-01-16,2300756,Kim,"This cozy house was a great fit for a girls weekend with my mother. It's centrally located to many of Monterey bay attractions and restaurants. Ben and Heather were hyper communicative, but also gave us our space. We didn't actually end up even needing to meet them face to face, because we were able to coordinate via email/text. The unit is clean, updated, and well stocked. We didn't end up using the kitchen, but it seemed to have any amenities you would need. All in all, we greatly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to visitors heading to the area. "

14804837,128952687,2017-01-28,11791194,Sian,We stayed at Ben's place with our 2 year old daughter and I would recommend it so highly to anyone travelling with kids. There is plenty of space and they have taken care to make it child friendly. It's beautifully decorated but nothing can be easily knocked or damaged by little fingers. They also provide a crib and a multitude of other bits and pieces which make life easy.  We took advantage of the aquarium passes and our daughter LOVED  it. Added to all that is a fabulous location walking distance from Pacific Grove and the beach at Lovers' Point... we will recommend it to anyone travelling in this area (with or without kids) and really hope to be back ourselves before long. Thanks Ben and Heather for a fabulous trip to this beautiful place.

The living areas are well-thought out with nice linens, super comfortable beds and plenty of drawer and closet space. Wi-fi speed and  newer technologies for entertainment makes your stay enjoyable and carefree.  The location is amazing ~ walk to breakfast, the movies, shopping or the beach in less than 5 -10 minutes. Pacific Grove is a very special place and finding Ben and Heather's home makes it a destination I am anxious to visit over and over again!"
14804837,130410090,2017-02-05,41668715,Allison,"I loved my stay at Ben's bungalow, absolutely perfect for a weekend getaway. Great location near coffee shops and cafes, and a short walk to the water. I walked to the Bay Aquarium from here, which was a scenic walk just over a mile long. The Aquarium passes that Ben left made the trip very easy. The place itself was very clean, modern, and a great size for a weekend trip. Would definitely stay here again."
14804837,131597977,2017-02-12,110233250,Rachel,"Loved the kitchen (extremely well stocked) and the bar/kitchen stools-enjoyed the alley view.  House was very clean, quiet and the parking was great.  Easy walking distance to dinner, breakfast, small grocery store and ice cream (also to movie theater). "
14804837,131788327,2017-02-13,5119303,Polly,"Lovely apartment in a nice neighborhood, walking distance to restaurants and the waterfront. The apartment was super clean and new and comfortable. Ben was really helpful and communicative! Would highly recommend!"
14804837,133467074,2017-02-22,68453478,Brandon,This apartment is very clean tidy and quaint just like the picture show. Very impressed with the level of detail and consideration for guests. Great location for accessing the 17 Mile Drive Monterey Bay Aquarium and you can easily walk to shops and restaurants. We highly recommend and would stay here again.
14804837,134535656,2017-02-27,77397429,Susan,Great location! House has everything we needed.  Loved the area and that we could walk to a  lot of things.  Loved the old architecture of the house and all the buildings in the area.  Having 2 bedrooms was great for my friend and I.
14804837,135644216,2017-03-05,396952,Lani,This place was perfect for a weekend getaway with my family. The house offered everything you would need for a family with a small child. It looked like the space had recently been updated. It was clean and well equipped with all the necessities. We even thought about bringing our folded wagon but decided to keep our packing light and were pleasantly surprised to see one for us to use right at the front door. Great place. Very clean. Bed was comfy. We will be back! 
14804837,136620856,2017-03-11,18742409,Emily,Loved our stay. Lots of space & a brilliant area with lots to do!
14804837,137174204,2017-03-13,14965802,Karen,"I and my friend stayed in Ben's lovely place for two nights. The duplex is very comfortable and cozy, everything's tidy and clean. We loved the kitchen! The location is also great, just by the Lighthouse Ave, and within 7 mins walk to Lover's Point beach, fantastic for early joggers like me! Ben and Heather are great hosts! I'll choose this place again if we visit PG next time!"
14804837,139885494,2017-03-26,38010509,Paul,"Ben's place was perfect for our family. It had everything we needed. We used the passes for the Aquarium in the morning, and went to the beach in the afternoon. It was a great weekend away."
14804837,140253372,2017-03-28,45409539,Gay,"Ben and Heather's place is truly a wonderful home away from home. Complete with all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay.  It is located in a residential neighborhood within walking distance of beautiful Lovers Point and fine dining. It's an excellent weekend getaway spot and the FREE passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium were a terrific perk.
We are so happy we chose Pacfic Grove over Carmel, which has a much more touristy, stuck-up, turn-you-upside down and ""see how much money falls out"" commercial feel about it. (Know what I mean?)"
14804837,140981293,2017-04-01,51355644,Evan,"This is a beautiful home in a prime location for the Monterey area. During our stay we visitited the Monterey Bay Aquarium (passes provided by Ben!), Big Sur, Carmel, and Lover's Point. It was so nice to be able to come home to such a charming place after a day of adventuring. Ben is a great host. Communicates well and answers any questions you might have. Check-in was simple. Parking is easy to find right on the street. "
14804837,141572498,2017-04-03,16962363,Julie,"We had a great stay at bens. Everything was as expected, very clean, and in good condition. The place was even available a little earlier than expected on check in day and Ben kindly sent me a message to let me know. "
14804837,142524827,2017-04-08,807721,Michelle,"Great location - close to town, beach, coastal walking path, park and aquarium! Host was accommodating, helpful and very quick with communication. Lovely place and lovely town. "
14804837,143410700,2017-04-11,24272232,Kristina,"Location, location, location! Perfect spot to walk to restaurants, shops, coast. Love the mix of original antique details such as built in shelves and crystal doorknobs with the very modern kitchen and bath. Well equipped kitchen, plenty of plush towels, quiet at night. "
14804837,144381490,2017-04-15,12669240,Kelly,"This place is wonderful - immaculate, updated, and a short walk from a kids' playground, an ice cream parlor, coffee shops, a bookstore, restaurants, and the beach. Communication with Ben was efficient and effortless, and the aquarium passes (which allow you to skip the line and go in the member entrance) are a huge bonus. We brought our toddler, and she was excited to find some toy cars & trucks and new (to her) books to read. We're already checking the calendar to see when we can go back. Thanks, Ben!"
14804837,145345310,2017-04-17,4097239,Sam,"Super easy, pleasant place to stay, in a great location.  Aquarium passes are a huge benefit!"

14804837,146760386,2017-04-23,24709631,Lucinda,"This house is beautifully set up and particularly perfect for a family with small kids. They have thought of everything ... a wagon to take to the beach, sand toys, even a small library of bedtime books. "
14804837,147434676,2017-04-26,56199669,Holly,"Wonderful place to stay with small children. It was very clean and welcoming. A block away from a fun park, ice cream shop, restaurants and coffee shop. Very short walk to the beach. We brought our new born and 2 year old and had a lovely time. "
14804837,148042778,2017-04-29,21508473,Sergio,"For the first time ever, the place was better than the pictures.  The quality of linens, appliances, beds, etc etc was top! Awesome value! Easy-breezy! We travel as a family, with very small kids, I wish every place we stay in were like Ben's place.  "
14804837,148878804,2017-05-01,14014470,Jennifer,"Ben and Heather are great hosts. Their place is cute, comfortable and is located in a beautiful area!"

14804837,150390932,2017-05-07,126539910,Sara,"Great place! Very clean & walking distance to all the cute shops, restaurants and beach. "
14804837,150639478,2017-05-08,30353868,Gracie,"Our stay was amazing! I'm not always the biggest fan of AirBNBs because I'm a neat freak. This place was spotless, sheets were soft, towels were fresh/not musty. We only stayed for one night so we didn't utilize the kitchen but that was really nice. I'd definitely stay here again if we're ever back in Monterey "
14804837,151426684,2017-05-12,46687829,Judy,Nice location! 
14804837,152502077,2017-05-16,1627940,Jennifer,"The house was just as described. It was exceptionally clean and the beds were comfortable, which is pretty important. It was also nice to have a crib since we were traveling with kids.  The location is great and it's easy to walk to the water or to restaurants. It was great to have the passes to the aquarium too. We went both days we were there. We'll definitely stay here again!"
14804837,154078526,2017-05-22,130512059,Celestino,"It had a very ""home-like"" feel! We had ourselves saying ""let's go back home"" when we were done with our day out. The house was well kept and very clean. It was in close reach to everywhere we wanted to go to. Having the trip to the Aquarium thrown in with the stay was so great! We will be back. I would recommend this place to anyone! It was worth every penny!"
14804837,154492145,2017-05-24,124803576,Soo,"Ben's home was the most ideal place for my family and it will be for you as well, especially if you have children. I have two little ones and being offered not only a second bedroom but also a Baby Bjorn pack and play was perfect, as it was one less thing to pack for our trip!
The home is closely located to the aquarium and some really fantastic restaurants (my husband loved the ribeye steak at the Red House Cafe), as well as grocery stores and laundromat if you're in the need for supplies and clean clothes. The home is cozy, warm and comfortable. Communication with Ben is a breeze as he's very responsive to texts. I highly recommend this home to those with and without kids."
14804837,156076107,2017-05-29,112179996,William,"A perfect position for our Monterey golf trip - all the great courses a very short drive away. The house is exactly as it looks and is described on Air BnB, so we were more than happy. There's a fantastic fish restaurant a one minute's walk away, and plenty of places for classic American breakfasts. Highly recommended."
14804837,156494384,2017-05-30,3495853,Man,Loving this chic and cozy place. My friends and I do enjoy a good time there. Thanks for our host.

14804837,158664965,2017-06-07,20818057,Anne,"Fantastic place to stay in PG.  Very kid friendly apartment--- but I would be very comfortable their without kids too.  It's not over the top kids.  You can hear cars drive by in the front bedroom so it's not quite as quiet as some other places in PG. But honestly, PG is not that noisy anyways. The home is a short walk to beach and the farmer's market.   I will stay here again.  "
14804837,159362567,2017-06-10,45830158,Allen,Great location. Nicest people 
14804837,161080891,2017-06-16,125768302,Katherine,"Great place. Clean, bright and eady access into town and nearby towns. Never had an issue with parking and found a laundromat across the street which was convenient. We woukd stay again in a heartbeat. "
14804837,161810417,2017-06-18,121675801,Jenna,Super cute small space. Great for a family or small group of friends. Kitchen is well appointed with new appliances. Location is good for walking to local restaurants and shops.

14804837,165379284,2017-07-01,1807751,Danielle,"Ben and Heather's place couldn't have been more perfect for our needs. Traveling with two small children, there was space to play, toys, books, delicious restaurants were within a short walking distance and, the neighborhood felt safe and was nice and quiet. 

We hope to stay with Ben & Heather again soon! 

"
14804837,166481404,2017-07-03,50406,Omer,Ben was a gracious and accommodating host. All information was communicated in a clear and timely manner.  The check-in was seamless and we arrived to find the apartment just as it was presented in the photos.  All the extras like the fully equipped modern kitchen and the beach toys and wagon made it feel like home.  The main drag with all the local restaurants and boutiques was just down the block in the commercial district.  The beach was a short walk away. All you could hope for on a visit to this lovely part of California
14804837,166853288,2017-07-04,256982,Michael,"Ben was very responsive and a very attentive host.  The house was perfect for a one night visit with a friend who came up from Santa Barbara.  Very clean, pleasantly appointed.  The kitchen was definitely the highlight and made for the perfect place to site and catch-up.  The house is blocks away from downtown Pacific Grove which is very convenient but far enough from the hustle and bustle.  The family passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium were a welcome added perk.  All in all a great stay!  I look forward to staying in your home again.  "
14804837,167146362,2017-07-05,32879186,Charles,"Great property and fantastic location. Ben was friendly, accommodating and easy to work with. We had a great time staying for the 4th of July."

14804837,171502735,2017-07-17,8937899,Allen,"A wonderful home in a wonderful location! Newly remodeled and very clean. From the bedding to the kitchen to the toys for kids, Ben's place had everything and more. A perfect location that's quiet and nearly walking distance to anywhere you'd want to be. The hosts were quick to answer questions and the aquarium passes were a nice bonus! We'll definitely be back! "
14804837,172391884,2017-07-20,36054379,Damien,Awesome location. Ben prépare the place as expected and the place is beyond the description. The whole family really liked it and made ourselves really feel like welcome locals. Everything is nearby. Willk come back. 
14804837,172743514,2017-07-21,55701724,Andrew,"Fantastic place....close enough to the 'action' of cannery road but secluded enough for peace and quiet...all amenities are top notch, newly renovated, excellent communication and very (Website hidden by Airbnb) short THE model A+ Airbnb...would book again in a heartbeat "
14804837,174109412,2017-07-24,193722,Coral,"Ben & Heather's place is perfect! It's the little things that count and they have thought of everything to ensure you have a seamless and wonderful stay. Comfortable linens, well stocked pantry/books/family gear, dimmer switches on all the lights, a Nest thermostat, and more. The free aquarium passes ($100+ in value!) were the cherry on top! I look forward to staying here again on a future visit!"
14804837,174686430,2017-07-26,137998127,T,Awesome location. Great communication. Thoughtful details in the house that made us feel right at home. And the aquarium passes were a huge plus!
14804837,176401562,2017-07-30,922723,Rachel,"We had a wonderful stay at Ben's place. The space itself is exactly as shown in the photographs. Modern, well-equipped and very clean. The beds were comfortable and we appreciated the pack-n-play for my son who travelled with me. There were also some toys that he enjoyed playing with. Less things to pack if you're travelling with a child. The beach was a short walk away, there was a park nearby and the downtown was walking distance as well. A great place to have as home base for a quiet vacation."
14804837,177138454,2017-08-01,116749756,Oana,"Charming and very clean 2 bedroom duplex conveniently located to shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove.

14804837,177681482,2017-08-03,38216097,Sally,We (2 adults and 2 children) really enjoyed staying here - it was everything as described. It is central to Pacific Grove but a bit further to Monterey (probably about a half hour walk to the aquarium). Thanks for a lovely stay.

Its centrally located, easily walkable to restaurants and beaches, not to mention the guest passes to the Monterey Aquarium that work like a charm.  It really was a great stay and would recommend to anyone considering staying in the area."
14804837,180585380,2017-08-10,24214771,Emma,We loved staying here.  The house is so well equipped throughout and it's clear a lot of thought has gone into ensuring the right equipment is in the right place.  Our daughter loved all the children's books; it took some encouragement for her to put the books down and go exploring.  The passes to the aquarium were a huge bonus.  We would love to come back!
14804837,181431335,2017-08-12,14598409,Celine,Charming place.

14804837,190282504,2017-09-03,44328319,Bern,Ben's place was perfect for our family of four and the location is ideal. It's walking distance to all attractions and we especially appreciated use of aquarium passes.
14804837,191500072,2017-09-07,2664999,Christian & Radha,"My family of 4 with two young boys spent a few days here. This place is fantastic. Just as shown and the hosts are great on communications and support. Very comfortable and clean. Easy walking to lots of shops in Pacific Grove and down to the bay. Convenient 5 min drive to downtown Monterey. Couldn't give it a higher rating.

We use the aquarium visit coupons as the gift from landlord, very interesting activities. It was a wonderful stay."
14804837,192996746,2017-09-11,139012951,Jamie,This place was absolutely perfect! the location was amazing and the house was comfortable and very functional. We brought our 10 month old and the house was baby proofed and had great toys she LOVED. Thank you Ben!

The house is spacious with a nice modern layout, ideal for for a family with young kids. It very central to shops, the beach and a park with a great playground.
The aquarium passes is a great bonus.
The communication with Ben and his family was very pleasant.
We would love to come back!"
14804837,195790575,2017-09-20,44925608,Reid,"Ben's place was very nice. We didn't stay there very long, but it was a nice 2 bedroom condo unit that had everything you could want. The area was great and we would return again."

Communication and documentation were wonderfully helpful, and Ben was just next door in the attached duplex unit in case anything was needed.

14804837,198243240,2017-09-28,62481845,Adeline,"The house is lovely. Well furnished and practical. We found everything we needed. There were more than enough towels. Beds are very comfortable. The road facing bedroom had noise from the traffic but we were up early so it was ok. For those who want to sleep in, take the back facing bedroom. Parking was super convenient just outside the house. Ben is very efficient in responding. The aquarium passes were fantastic! We loved our visit."
14804837,198849300,2017-09-30,146168299,Dana,"This is a great little place with a very convenient location.  We were able to walk down the street to grab meals in downtown Pacific Grove.  We were just a few minutes drive to all of desired stopping points in Monterey.  While the location of this home is very convenient, it also lends to more street noise and bright headlights into the master bed window at night."
14804837,199999566,2017-10-03,42259735,Sarah,"A perfect spot to enjoy this beautiful region. The apartment is spacious, light, clean and modern. It was an ideal spot to stay with our 11 month old daughter. Ben and Heather have kindly left behind toys for small children. 

We adored Pacific Grove and the fact that the apartment was so close to the beach. Heather and Ben were very easy to get hold of during our stay and they kindly gave advice on places to visit etc. The aquarium passes are brilliant, saving us $100!

We cannot recommend this airbnb highly enough. Thanks Ben and Heather!"

14804837,204158812,2017-10-16,79694151,Cassandra,"Nicely sized bungalow in a great location. Easy walk to activities and restaurants in Pacific Grove. The house easily fit my family of four and blends original details like built-ins with a modern renovation of the kitchen and bath. It's tidy, well organized and stocked with extras like beach towels, a kid-friendly collection of books and toys, and the guest passes to the aquarium were a great bonus. Check-in/out was a breeze and Ben was quick to be in touch. Highly recommend this as home base for a Monterey vacation!"
14804837,204752870,2017-10-19,115673816,Melanie,"We had a wonderful time here! The place was exactly as described and pictured. Very clean and well supplied. The location was awesome and easily walkable to the downtown area and water (this includes walkable for my 76-year old grandmother who was with us). We also have a toddler and this was by far the most small child-friendly place we've stayed. They even had child plates and utensils, and several toys at the house. In fact, I think my son's favorite part of our whole vacation was playing with someone else's toy cars and blocks! We would stay here again in a heartbeat."

The place is perfect for a little getaway with my kiddo."

14804837,216414065,2017-12-03,48883791,Pete,"Ben’s place is one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed in especially in the category of “walk to great shops and food.’

Pacific Grove is quaint (especially around the holidays) and Ben’s historic home provides two bedrooms, a nice TV/sitting room and well appointed kitchen. Chrome cast your computer’s streaming channels to the flat screen TV. 

Not much else to say, except that they keep this nicely renovated space very clean and tidy with all the stuff you need."

This was one of the cleanest homes we have ever set foot in in our entire lives! The location on Lighthouse Ave. was superb and we appreciated the many thoughtful touches throughout the house, with labels in every drawer and cupboard, an extensive children's book collection, and an easy to use Next thermostat.

Room is large, has a basic breakfast (which we really appreciated) and check in/out was super easy. Unfortunately didn't get to meet josh and anji as we didn't stay long, however they were very good at communicating with us before/during our stay. Overall really cozy- we did hear them walking up the stairs from time to time but this didn't bother us (and they provided ear plugs!). They were very accommodating. "

15165034,123996027,2016-12-31,41106874,Denisse,"Josh and Angi's home was the perfect place for me and our family. My husband and I stayed there for one night with both of our kids age 4 and 2. The host were so kind hat they provided us with toys and movies for our kids, a mattress and kids linens. They also really kind to lent us their aquarium passes. 
The room was really well equipped, you don't need to bring anything. They even provided coffee, creamer, sugar, assortment of teas, fruit, cocoa, and oatmeal. 
I highly recommend staying there.

15165034,124768869,2017-01-02,28594890,Eric,The room is cozy and pretty. Everything is decorated. My parents are very satisfied. Definitely recommend everyone to stay here!!
15165034,125612869,2017-01-06,108585561,Maddy,"The room is super private, super clean, and has everything you need. The coffee and food was much appreciated and the aquarium passes were an awesome bonus. Josh and Angi are super nice. "
15165034,125787751,2017-01-07,104062848,Kaysha,Great place. Conveniently located and Angie has thought of everything for a comfortable stay and yummy breakfast. Self-contained and private.  Aquarium passes are a great bonus - the jellyfish were awesome!
15165034,126000573,2017-01-08,109078295,Stephanie,"Our host was very pleasant. The welcoming was very heart warming. Perfect location, close to Carmel, Cannery Row, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the beaches which we got to do on this very short trip. The amenities were very nice and very well maintained. We personally enjoyed the pieces of art they have in the room. "
15165034,126418155,2017-01-11,50013406,Melanie And Max,"Josh and Angi have created a great space for couples. It is super convenient to explore all of the communities in the area, and they have really made the effort to make their guests comfortable. This is a lower level unit with an active family living above. They did provide a white noise machine and earplugs to help their guests."
15165034,126538322,2017-01-12,24427321,Cliff,"Nice private room and bath, exactly as represented and Josh and Angi were great hosts. The aquarium passes they offered made the room an excellent value, nearly equalling the entire cost of the room for the night. Would definitely stay here again!"
15165034,127237356,2017-01-16,10513674,Nelson,"Josh and Angi's place was perfect!  The location is a short drive to the Aquarium and Wharf area.  The start of the 17 mile scenic route for Carmel is just a few blocks away, too!  They were gracious enough to let us use their guest passes for the aquarium and buy us a new container of half in half for coffee in the morning! 
The room is spacious and has many amenities that most other Airbnb rentals don't have.  They really do go above and beyond to accommodate their guests and make them fee comfortable.  Thank you, guys!"
15165034,127729977,2017-01-20,4633379,Peter,"Josh and Angi's home is a great home away from home. Located very conveniently near Monterey and Pacific Grove, it allows easy access to Big Sur and the surrounding area. Josh and Angi were very helpful to us, providing us with tips about the local attractions. A great time."
15165034,128128353,2017-01-22,17402979,Elyse,"Listing was exactly as described.  Centrally located, easy drive to Monterey and Carmel.  Very comfortable and clean. Perfect for a place to lounge and sleep after being out site seeing all day. There was some noise as described, but not excessive by any means. It is a lower level room so you can hear footsteps and muffled talking.  The hosts were very thoughtful with all the little homey touches: coffee, tea, honey, half and half, and a few dishes to use, along with oatmeal and fresh fruit. The aquarium passes were awesome as well!! That is the reason we came so those really helped with saving some money. Trader Joe's right around the corner. Overall, my husband and I had a wonderful stay. Would highly recommend as a great place to stay for site seeing in the area."
15165034,128439572,2017-01-24,105140416,Brooke,Perfect place to stay with our family of three. Incredible location! Kind hosts. 
15165034,128545427,2017-01-25,41572168,Linda,"I was traveling alone and was looking for a safe place. I felt completely at ease.  Everything was as described and the room was great for a place to sleep, shower and a way to enjoy Monterey!"
15165034,129248610,2017-01-29,110729300,Winky,"Josh and Agni really went the extra mile for me. They accommodated my early arrival and happily let me use the aquarium pass on both Saturday and Sunday. They were friendly and attentive, leaving extra [delicious] apples outside my door, and they were also unobtrusive. Josh also helped me get to a location five miles away to meet my friends for the next leg of my journey. Their ad is accurate that you can hear their family moving around overhead, but it made me smile knowing they were there. Overall it was a great experience...and my first Air B+B. I would certainly visit again and use of the aquarium passes makes this stay super worth while."
15165034,129426133,2017-01-30,4167569,Gwen,"The room was so clean, lovely and comfortable. Our check in was seamless! Thanks! The spot is just a straight shot down the road from the aquarium - the passes that Josh and Angi provide with the stay are definitely a perk! Absolutely recommended to other travelers. "
15165034,129573403,2017-01-31,10616417,Yuting,"距离17英里非常近,附近就有加油站,超市,还有好吃的墨西哥菜,非常赞~"
15165034,129833879,2017-02-02,7988507,Benjamin,"We had a great stay at Josh and Angi's place - it's like a hotel room with a private entrance, it should really be listed as having a whole place to yourself. There is a whole breakfast nook set-up, it's very well thought out. Angi was easy to communicate with and very available. With the aquarium passes, it was an amazing deal. Would gladly stay again!"
15165034,129976234,2017-02-03,11952532,Warren,"Josh & Angi were awesome hosts -- easy to reach, very pleasant to interact with, and gave great recommendations. The room is clean & comfy and has everything you need -- they also provided a light breakfast which was awesome! The aquarium passes were the icing on top as it's a huge value & the aquarium is by far the best we have ever been to. We highly recommend staying with Josh & Angi!"
15165034,130393297,2017-02-05,16019536,Amanda & Paul,"Josh and Angi's place was the perfect location for us, as we had plans in Carmel, Monterey and Pacific Grove throughout the weekend, and their spot is perfectly situated making access to the whole area super easy. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but were grateful for some fresh fruit, and getting quick help from Angi with some questions. I was there with my 10-year-old daughter for a birthday getaway, and she was delighted. The kids/family life noise mentioned in the description is accurate, but there are earplugs and a white noise machine provided if needed. Overall we loved spending time in such a beautiful area. "
15165034,130828417,2017-02-08,10516220,Elke,Die Unterkunft ist einfach aber sauber. In Verbindung mit den Eintrittskarten für das Monterey Bay Aquarium ist das Angebot unschlagbar! Empfehlenswert!
15165034,131271150,2017-02-11,45890329,Galin,"I, have a nice time! Recommended "
15165034,132393598,2017-02-17,37709750,Lisa,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Josh & Angi's place. The description was very accurate. The location was ideal, close to all the thinks we wanted to do in Monterey. Covered carport parking was very convenient. The space was very private and comfortable and Josh & Angi were very responsive and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend staying here. "
15165034,132892711,2017-02-19,38969742,Nelson,"This place was excellent. It was conveniently located between Monterey and 17 mile drive. You can drive to the aquarium in 5 minutes and to the wharf in 10 minutes. 17-mile drive is only a 5 minute drive. On top of all of this, the place is very nice and really lovely. "
15165034,133134152,2017-02-20,95213292,Auschere,The aquarium passes are awesome and make the room such a great value. The room was also really nice and really close to everything in town. 
15165034,133309501,2017-02-21,22802611,Meaghan,Very nice family.  The room was exactly as advertised. 
15165034,133619849,2017-02-23,13392650,Jodie,"Our experience was simple and easy - the location made it super easy to get around, and the aquarium was an unexpectedly great extra."
15165034,133768862,2017-02-24,56874157,Shad,"Josh and Anji's unit was cute, comfy, clean and easy to find.  We enjoyed Pacific Grove, Carmel and Monterey sites.  I caught lovely views of the sea on my neighborhood walk.  On a warmer day, we would've enjoyed the large covered patio table setting in their lovely garden nook."
15165034,134312421,2017-02-26,104637463,Kulsum,Good location if you are sight-seeing in Carmel or Monterey.  All amenities were clean and in order as described on Airbnb website.
15165034,135023845,2017-03-02,44048721,Jennifer,Josh and Angi were great. They gave us many helpful recommendations of local attractions and were very welcoming. The room matched its description very well and was spacious and comfortable. 
15165034,135187996,2017-03-03,25410410,Logan And Jennee,"Josh and Angi were more than accommodating, and the aquarium passes were a definite plus!"
15165034,135689854,2017-03-05,2469043,Will,"The quintessential Airbnb experience. For a fraction of the cost of a hotel, we had a clean and comfy apartment in a central location. Josh and Angi communicated easily via text, though we never actually met them -- the room was private and separate from the house. I should mention the bed was extremely comfortable! Could not recommend their place more highly. Thanks guys!"
15165034,136282047,2017-03-09,119483012,Amy,"I have to disagree with the previous guests, this place was NOT clean.  Bath mat was dirty and matted, mirrored closet doors had a haze of dirt, that made the entire room seem dirty.  The bedding was horrible (very well worn, flannel sheets, yuck! along With a worn out, bunched up comforter).  The location was ok, if you have a car.  
I agree that Angi was very sweet and a quick to respond to messages/texts.  She was very quick to point out that she had mentioned three times on her page that there was no cable TV, however, when I checked the description of the place, it was NOT listed at all.  She then pointed out that it was mentioned on the picture ""description"".  What the?  Who reads that??  All in all, it was not my favorite, by far, however, It was a good, cheap getaway if you don't mind a well worn room.  I did feel safe there and the neighborhood was quiet and pretty.  
It just wasn't comfortable to me.  "
15165034,136440893,2017-03-10,43125812,Adam,Josh and Angie's place is great extremely neat and exactly as advertised. If in Monterey again I would stay a second time! 
15165034,137338995,2017-03-14,113576897,Nicole,Great little spot. Host were very accommodating. We were checking in pretty late and they didn't bat an eye at waiting for us to get there. 
15165034,137476746,2017-03-15,27461690,Alicia,"My husband and I stayed here for one night, as we were stopping in the Monterrey area for a brief visit. Josh and Angi's place was perfectly located to explore Pacific Grove/Monterrey and the surrounding area, and also very clean and comfortable! We never met them in person but they were super helpful with check in, giving us free aquarium passes and fixing the wifi when it wasn't working. Would definitely recommend this to others! "
15165034,137841969,2017-03-17,74351731,Randy,Great location & value. Everything as advertised. Very clean. Angi & Josh even provided fruit & refreshments. The Aquarium passes saved us $100. 
15165034,139128982,2017-03-23,35158235,Mike And Karen,"This is a great location, with wonderful hosts, a comfortable room and a beautiful porch. Angi gave us some great ideas for restaurants and places to see, and the Aquarium passes were a fun bonus.

They mention that they are a family living in the house and there will be noise, but we never had a problem with it. You could hear the children going up the stairs to bed, but it was much earlier than we would have been going to bed ourselves, so it didn't bother us.

We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Pacific Grove/Monterey Bay."
15165034,139302980,2017-03-24,28700577,Alice,"This place is nice and private, in a quiet residential neighborhood. It's also a great location, close to the aquarium with free guest passes, which was really great for our family. It is also just a short drive from beautiful cliffs and the ocean just south of the neighborhood. Definitely recommend for anyone looking to see great scenery and visit the aquarium!"
15165034,139857558,2017-03-26,48191975,Uday,We stayed in the room at the back. Everything was very well arranged. The house looks a bit old from outside but very clean from inside. The aquarium passes makes it a sweet deal ! 
15165034,140069557,2017-03-27,26919892,Nate & Amanda,Nice private room with private bath. Josh and Angie were very accommodating and we enjoyed using the aquarium passes.
15165034,140260150,2017-03-28,72798142,Erin,Angi provided us with fruit & coffee (with cream & suger) - which was a novelty for two traveling girls. Aquarium passes were a perk too! The separate entrance made it easy to come and go. Definitely recommend staying here. 
15165034,140554879,2017-03-30,28889447,Susan,"Great location, very easy to get to the aquarium and friendly hosts.  We didn't get in until later than expected and since no one was using the aquarium passes the next day, she offered to let us use them again (very kind, though we got through the aquarium in the time we had :D )  Nice bed, lovely touches with coffee and cocoa being available for the morning.  I would definitely recommend to others.  "
15165034,140973035,2017-04-01,111601040,Chris,"Wonderful place, helpful and thoughtful hosts!  The accommodations were clean and comfortable and Angi and Josh were available to answer questions and give advice.  The aquarium passes were awesome!  Thanks!  "

15165034,141923348,2017-04-05,81981386,Stefanie,"Friendly family host, great location,  private door access and beautiful setting. Perfect for a get away at an affordable price!"
15165034,142141689,2017-04-06,20248208,Tai,Josh and Angie were very warm and welcoming. It was a pleasant stay. Definitely worth staying.
15165034,142325232,2017-04-07,4192717,Elizabeth,"Lovely little room with its own carport and entrance. Well kept and thoughtful - the little heater in there works well to keep you warm and there were organic fruit and snacks available. Angi was super helpful and communicative, even brought in a basket of toys and books for my 15 month old to play with, which she loved! The guest passes to the aquarium were awesome - we got to skip the long line and go through the member entrance. Really nice stay."
15165034,143195242,2017-04-10,67067408,Sharon,Such a lovely stay. Very clean and very private. The shower and the bed are great. The hosts are so kind and helpful. Thank you for a lovely stay!
15165034,143604922,2017-04-12,111638662,Jackie,The space was perfect with an outside covered patio and a driveway which was great not to have to worry about parking after a long day of sightseeing.  Josh and Angi's home is close to everything we wanted to see.  I do not think there is one thing that Angi forgot to make our stay the best!  Thank you again to Josh and Angi!!
15165034,144085025,2017-04-14,78480674,Charlotte,"A super room with private bath and eating facilities.  Josh, Angi and their kids were warm and welcoming.  Perfect for visiting Monterey "
15165034,144831424,2017-04-16,738725,Celine,"The place is as shown in the pictures , clean and comfortable. Angi did her best for us to have a good time and is very friendly. The aquarium passes were a real gift as we had an amazing time there, which would have cost us much more otherwise . "
15165034,145539780,2017-04-18,43717641,Sharon,"The room was better, more spacious than depicted in the photos. It was spick and span, with lots of little detail that turned out to be treats - e.g. the fruits, cereal mixes and tea that awaited us (all organic), toiletries, books, dvds and even toys that were put out for our kids to play. Beautiful artwork and pictures were hung all over the room. A spare mattress was provided for our child and he had a ton of fun sleeping in it laid out in the closet with the door open. Angi and Josh were prompt in all their communications and were very hospitable hosts. I would highly recommend this airbnb! The free aquarium passes were a bonus too!"
15165034,146135775,2017-04-21,65148186,Grace,Great location and hosts. The aquarium passes were a huge help to defray the costs of the trip. Liked that we had a private room and bath. 
15165034,146863074,2017-04-24,127276493,Ami,The host canceled this reservation 88 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15165034,147268529,2017-04-25,29073673,Kelly,"Josh and Angi were great hosts! Super friendly and accommodating. We took advantage of the aquarium passes which was a fun addition to our visit and their place is literally down the street from aquarium. We also really appreciated the coffee machine, light snacks, fresh water and access to fridge and microwave (as well as a heater or air conditioner depending on the weather). We would definitely visit again and recommend to anyone. Thank you again!"
15165034,147586235,2017-04-27,96749523,Joshua,Is exactly as described. Very convenient location.
15165034,148881990,2017-05-01,2529373,Diane,A great place in a terrific location. We utilized the aquarium passes and had a great time. We had everything we needed for a wonderful weekend.
15165034,149724786,2017-05-05,5535548,Wei,"Anji's place is perfect. She is the best host I have ever met on Airbnb, very responsive and kind. Her kids are great too! The place is definitely it if you want to go to the aquarium, 17 mile and Carmel."
15165034,149928995,2017-05-06,33535305,Xiangjin,good place to stay in monterey
15165034,150325084,2017-05-07,2529325,Dawn,Great stay! Josh and Angi are great communicators and the entire process was easy and enjoyable. The space was exactly what we were looking for and I felt totally at home. Thank you so much for everything!
15165034,150663528,2017-05-08,115708854,Mariah,Awesome place :)
15165034,150892630,2017-05-09,124990475,Phil,"We loved the spacious room, as well as the attention to detail from our hosts. They even brought out toys for our 4 year old and provided bedding and towels with child prints on it - he was so excited.  Angi was very friendly, open and considerate, making us feel at home instantly. "
15165034,151034706,2017-05-10,52719629,Michelle,The Aquarium passes are huge plus! Josh and Angi were very nice and we enjoyed our stay at their place. 
15165034,151388875,2017-05-12,51511329,Joanne,"Great place for visiting Point Lobos, Asilomar, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Angi's place has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Communication and finding the place was no problem at all. If we visit Monterey again, we'd definitely stay here again."
15165034,151976991,2017-05-14,120115392,Chelsey,"Our stay with Josh and Angi was great! We were pushing it on check in time and got there just before, Angi was still sweet as could be. She gave us tips for getting around and we had a blast using their aquarium passes!

The place looked just as pictured and described, and the patio was beautiful all lit up. The room even came with wine glasses and a cork opener to really enjoy the evening. Can't wait to come back!"
15165034,152684734,2017-05-17,128798349,Catherine,Très bien situé car près du centre historique et de la côte et donc de l aquarium. 
15165034,153261523,2017-05-20,108400382,Martin,"It's a small spot literally a room, but it's got everything, although we did get woken up at 9 am due to power tools and other loud movement directly upstairs which impacted the stay, other than that they communicated, And the place was as advertised "
15165034,154004499,2017-05-22,62764329,Sereina,"Der Aufenthalt bei Angi und Josh ist sehr angenehm. Die Tickets für das Aquarium sind ein super Plus. 
Leider hat es kein Kochfeld sondern nur eine Mikrowelle, Toaster, Wasserkocher und Kaffeemaschine. 
Wir empfehlen den Aufenthalt sehr da die Lage sehr gut ist und es sehr komfortabel ist. "
15165034,154440844,2017-05-24,110725023,Caitlin,"Angi is very sweet. Close to Monterey Bay aquarium, 17 mile drive, carmel, and anything else you'd want to do in the area. It was super nice having a little private suite to relax in after exploring all day! The noise from upstairs can get a little loud, but there was fair warning about that."
15165034,154951237,2017-05-26,34095429,Martijn,We had two good nights. The place is close by 17-mile drive which we visisted by hiking. 
15165034,155168194,2017-05-27,34540236,Jordan,Josh and Angi were so nice and their place was extremely comfortable. They had just about everything you'd ever think you needed! Communication on the day of check-in was very detailed and they gave us a plethora of excellent suggestions of things to do in the area. Using their 2 extra guest passes to the aquarium was the highlight of our trip. 
15165034,155716621,2017-05-28,80735003,Cristy,Great hosts!!! Angi was very friendly. Room included everything needed to be comfortable. I would love to stay there again!

15165034,158210682,2017-06-05,40431114,Lynne,"Josh and Angi's place was perfect and had everything we needed.  We're a family of four that includes two young children (7 and 3 1/2) and our stay was very comfortable.  The place was spotless on our arrival, communication was fast and the peaceful location of their property was central to everything we wanted to experience.  We even ended our evening with a movie with our kids since a good selection of family-friendly movies were available for us to watch.  We were able to use the passes to the Aquarium which was generous in itself.  The family, including their vey sweet and very respectful kids, were warm and welcoming but definitely let us have our space.  We hope we'll be able to stay at Josh and Angi's place in the near future!"
15165034,158423156,2017-06-06,99835586,Moritz,"Die Unterkunft entsprach genau der Beschreibung. Angi hat uns freundlich empfangen und einen Tag vorher kontaktiert um unsere Ankunftszeit abzuklären. Man hat einen eigenen Eingang zum Zimmer mit einem eigenen, charmanten Außenbereich (in dem man schön sitzen kann). Das Zimmer war sauber und größer wie gedacht. Es hab sogar ein kleines Frühstück zum selber zubereiten. Unsere Ewartungen wurden übertroffen, super Unterkunft - kann man jedem bestens empfehlen! "
15165034,159117819,2017-06-09,129563473,Tao,Everything was great.
15165034,159298985,2017-06-10,34360252,Leslie,We enjoyed our time in Monterey and enjoyed this Air BNB.  It was very clean.  The hosts were great communicators.  The pictures and description were accurate.  It was nice having our own parking spot that was very convenient. I would recommend and would stay here again if in the area.
15165034,159790001,2017-06-11,59069008,Allie,Angi and Josh were great! Excellent at communicating about how to check in and more than accommodating to help us check into the aquarium. We really enjoyed our experience! Thank you Angi and Josh!
15165034,160125855,2017-06-12,119122981,Roddy,It was easy to find! It was separate and private and had a beautiful patio.  It was decorated so beautifully and we had everything we needed. Angi was so sweet and engaging. We would definitely want to stay there again if we were in the area!   
15165034,160369154,2017-06-13,32541593,Annalyn,The value is great and being my first time using Airbnb it was a great experience. Angi welcomed us at the door and gave a great recommendation for breakfast. Everything went smoothly and would return in the future. 
15165034,160813110,2017-06-15,126973112,Erika,This was our first experience with Airbnb.  We loved staying here.  The studio is very comfortable and Angie went the extra mile for us.
15165034,161377188,2017-06-17,25283894,Flint,Great location and amazing value. The aquarium passes alone were worth the stay. Thanks!
15165034,162885898,2017-06-22,56761163,Shawn,"Very clean, and the most comfortable bed and blankets I've ever slept in. Friendly family, great location. "
15165034,163153654,2017-06-23,34273433,Kate,"I am not exaggerating when I say that Josh and Angi's space is the nicest and most comfortable Airbnb I have ever stayed in. They have thought of everything their guests could need, from drinking water and glasses, to fruit and oatmeal for breakfast, to fresh coffee, to movies. The sleep number bed was extremely comfortable, and my husband loved being able to drink his coffee on the veranda in the morning. After the hustle and bustle of San Francisco this was the most calm and comfortable accommodation we could imagine. Moreover, Angi drove us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium so that we could take advantage of their guest passes, which really shows that these hosts go above and beyond for their guests. Thank you so much for making our visit to Monterey warm and comfortable!"
15165034,164548614,2017-06-28,61883189,Claire,"Very cute, cozy, welcoming place. Was great for a couple and would be great for a small family. Close to everything! "
15165034,164827349,2017-06-29,2704582,Chris,"We had a great experience at Josh and Angi's place. They were out of town when we arrived, but they had a friend available if we needed any help. The space was very clean and had extra touches like hot tea and fruit. If you are looking for good value for a family this could be it. For sleeping a family of 4 like ours (2 adults and two children) the space is a bit tight. We knew that ahead of the time so it was just fine. 

Highly recommended!

15165034,165419629,2017-07-01,136972528,Lauren,Very kind and friendly people. Completely willing to help in anyway possible.
15165034,165711093,2017-07-01,96575260,Julia,Josh and Angi's place is wonderful! The pictures are very accurate. It's a very comfortable and peaceful private room and patio. Josh and Angi are great hosts. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
15165034,166825026,2017-07-04,136648694,Priscilla,This was a great experience. The fruit and oatmeal provided were a nice touch since I usually try staying at hotels with free breakfast. It was nice to not have to spend money on 3 meals. 
15165034,167155074,2017-07-05,39866688,Flora,"Josh and Angi's place is definitely clean and tidy. The size is perfect for two to three people. Four is a little bit crowed for four adult, but if you know how to arrange the foams, it will be a sweet place to stay at!! Recommend it!"
15165034,167724499,2017-07-07,5547935,Edith," We had two beautiful days in Monterey. The appartment had been perfect, clean and cosy. All arrangements with josh and angi were easy and without any problems.
Kind regards Edith and Kim"
15165034,168627433,2017-07-09,3121064,Anthony,Awesome location across from the entrance to Pebble Beach. The room is well-appointed and very cozy. 
15165034,168947797,2017-07-10,139153990,Desiree,"Josh and Angie are extremely hospitable. The description is very accurate in what to expect, we had our baby so I was extremely relieved to know that if he fussed it wasn't a issue. An added bonus is that there is a grocery store less than ten minutes walking distance!"
15165034,169240822,2017-07-11,137716241,Eleni,Best airbnb experience so far! Friendly hosts and great amenities 
15165034,169517288,2017-07-12,75646106,Kelli,"Great place!  Enjoyed our stay! Very clean and comfortable.  The bed was awesome. 
Very close, maybe 10 minutes, by car to restaurants, shopping, wine tasting, the coast and 17 mile drive.  
You can hear foot steps above on occasion but quite honestly, I've heard worse in hotels.  This didn't bother us in the least but if you a light sleeper and need to day sleep, it might bother you.  This definitely is not a deal breaker and I would recommend this place to anyone and plan on coming back again the next time we are in town!  
Five stars!!!"
15165034,170130615,2017-07-14,45764900,Katie,"This is a private room with a its own entrance, bathroom, and parking area. It's very cozy and Josh and Angi are welcoming hosts. We wish we could have stayed longer and hope to be back!"
15165034,171794796,2017-07-18,135537120,Nicholas,Great place to stay while in Monterey/Carmel area. Clean and quiet and helpful hosts! Close to the aquarium and downtown Carmel! Thanks!

15165034,177433368,2017-08-02,91824504,Nate,"This is a great spot! Quiet neighborhood, 5 min drive from the beach and cannery row. Josh and Angi are great hosts."
15165034,177724496,2017-08-03,123110908,Marian,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was great! Communication was quick and simple with Angi. Her place was immaculate, accommodating, inviting, and comfortable. So many little details covered. I'd stay here over a hotel any day! Conveniently located to many things. My teen daughter and her friend were with me and it fit the three of us perfectly. Highly recommend! "
15165034,178128278,2017-08-04,6584532,Rahul,"Had a very nice stay, great location and very peaceful."
15165034,179161265,2017-08-06,4729035,Michelle,"Josh & Angi's place serves as the perfect base for exploring Monterey, Pacific Grove,  & Carmel! It is private and clean, with easy access, and is in a phenomenal location....close to shops and restaurants. We felt extremely comfortable and enjoyed all the amenities the room had to offer. Little things like toiletries, water, coffee, hot chocolate, and a fridge make their space feel even more homey. Both Josh & Angi were extremely kind and communicative...they are wonderful hosts and I would wholeheartedly recommend staying with them in the future!"
15165034,180965652,2017-08-11,39266839,Kristopher,"We would recommend this accommodation to everyone, communication was very easy, the room was very neat and offered everything we needed. It was a 2 mile walk to cannery row and the aquarium. We had a great stayed and wished we had more time."
15165034,182085004,2017-08-13,145210928,Jun,very nice room and excellent service!
15165034,182497649,2017-08-14,19306716,William,Place was very clean and nicely decorated.
15165034,182883802,2017-08-15,2892056,Tina,"Everything you need for great stay -- easy communication with Angi, easy check-in/out, super clean, super private, plus all the extra like kiddie toys, an abundance of towels, bathtub, and a dining table that doubles as a work space. Not 100% quiet as can hear the family doing their thing earlier in the evening, but not at all bothersome. Having a laundromat within walking distance (7ish mins) was useful. Monterey Bay Aquarium just a few minutes drive away, and Carmel not too far either."
15165034,183263444,2017-08-16,48317881,Angelica,Great hosts very acomodating and pleasant family!!! Had a great experience and we really enjoyed our stay.

15165034,185533207,2017-08-21,3865337,Alexander,"Lovely little spot that felt very private and comfortable. I loved the outdoor seating area. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely consider staying here again."
15165034,185834509,2017-08-22,31618944,Aimee,Angi greeted us and she was lovely. Gave a great dinner suggestion.... Lula's. Great location.  We enjoyed our stay very much and all the personal touches that made our stay feel like home!
15165034,186182476,2017-08-23,4372328,Alexandra & Fabian,"Josh and Angie are a very friendly and supportive couple with a beautifully done place.  
The beach is not far away and it is only a quick drive to Monterey.
We definitely recommend a stay!"
15165034,186850135,2017-08-25,38667037,Louis,"The house was very conveniently located, 5 minutes from where I was attending a conference. The room was as described: private, clean, a de-humidifier and a small heater made it very comfortable. A good experience!"
15165034,187268624,2017-08-26,50824467,Jennifer,"Josh and Angi's place was incredibly charming, cozy, and our own little getaway. The little amenities such as the tea/coffee maker, water pitcher, TV with movies, and more made it feel like our own little escape. It was great to make a cup of tea and sit out on the patio and enjoy the weather. We loved the Carmel and Monterey area - I would 100% stay here again. They provide us with great dinner suggestions, and we ended up going to a place they recommended, Forge in the Forest, in Carmel and it was delicious and the perfect date spot for my boyfriend and I. Great and friendly hosts. Thank you Josh and Angi."
15165034,187864389,2017-08-27,9116093,Julian,"Josh and Angi's place was great and perfect for out stay. Completely self-contained, nice private courtyard, clean with all the things we needed (eg wifi, coffee).  They were very responsive and check in / check out was super easy."

15165034,189741985,2017-09-02,140840376,Rose,Josh & Angi are great - stay with them!
15165034,190284526,2017-09-03,6958404,Tiara,"We really enjoyed our stay at Joh and Angi's! The place was in between Monterrey downtown area and 17 mile drive, about 5 minutes from both which made it really convenient for us to explore the area. The room is in a separate area from the main house wit its own private courtyard which we enjoyed. Angi gave us really clear directions and was excellent at communicating!"
15165034,190995018,2017-09-05,80339896,龙维薇,"房间干净整洁,设施齐全,细节布置体现出主人的用心,非常好的一晚体验。位置距离蒙特雷和卡梅尔都不远,赏景很方便。"

Great space and great location. They even let us use the guest passes to the Aquarium and it was so nice! Couldn’t have had a better stay."
15165034,192970864,2017-09-11,134635548,Yiying,Angi'a place is neat and comfortable. That was my first Airbnb experience. It was awesome! Angi also gave me helpful advice for dining.
15165034,193500603,2017-09-13,146382287,Asad,"This was our overnight pit stop on our way to San Francisco. I must say that it was wonderful. Josh and Angi were very communicative from the very beginning. The itinerary that they provided us with was very helpful and pinpointed all the must see sights and places. The place was clean and inviting. The backyard, beautiful and private parking was a great bonus."
15165034,194046578,2017-09-15,119608474,Guillermo,"Great location , clean , nice looking place , nice patio ,garage

15165034,195540633,2017-09-19,85865096,MrKbooth227,We had a great stay at Josh and Angi's place. There is a great little patio outside the room and a carport for parking. This spot is close to lots of restaurants and attractions. It's a good central location for exploring the Monterey and Carmel areas.
15165034,195783718,2017-09-20,48670433,Kathleen,Comfy and clean. Hosts were awesome and able to accommodate our very last minute request to book as we checked in about an hour before arriving. Very private and just what we needed!
15165034,196615057,2017-09-23,7042371,Curtis,"It was a great location for me. And as the listing says, it is a very active household! They do provide earplugs if it gets to be too much. A residential area, very close to main roads. Parking was easy and convenient."
15165034,198224956,2017-09-28,63858594,Jacqueline,"A one night stop on our way down the Californian coast. Arrived late but the host was very welcoming.  A family home, everything as described."
15165034,199406757,2017-10-01,47638853,Eric,"My friends and I we’re on a road trip along the California coast and we’re lucky enough to find Josh and Angi’s place on a week notice. Definitely a place we will be recommending to our friends and anyone who may be passing by. Clean, private and a very charming place with Josh and Angi being very responsive to our messages and extremely friendly at our arrival. Highly recommended."

15165034,204570974,2017-10-18,5652433,Diego,"Great, clean, and comfy space. Josh and Angi’s place could accommodate three adults comfortably. Easy drive to the downtown (just a little too far for a walk), and nice quiet place to rest. Definitely a great spot!"
15165034,205260817,2017-10-21,6724713,Emma,Josh and Angi were lovely hosts the space is perfect for two and has nice charm! We checked in easily and were able to communicate well with Josh and Angi when we needed to during our stay! We loved being able to bike around pacific grove and Monterey!

15165034,213112985,2017-11-19,20239910,Adina,"Their place was very nice, in a great central location close to 17 mile drive and an easy drive to Monterey, downtown Pacific Grove, or Carmel. It had a private entrance, and the room was clean and spacious. Check in was easy, and Angi had some good recommendations for places to eat in Carmel. There is a space heater and dehumidifier in the room that is intended to go during the night, which blocks out most of the noise. However, we ended up turning it off. The evening and early morning were quiet, but the house got a bit noisy around 8:00am. Overall we had a good stay here."
15165034,214105954,2017-11-24,16529242,Mukund,"Josh and Angi's place was perfect in all aspects. The listing is very accurate and the place is very clean and nicely done. They have all the amenities that you could need like coffee, tea, half & half etc. and the bed is extremely comfortable as well. Josh and Angi were always available to answer any questions we had and the check-in was seamless. The covered parking spot was a nice plus and the place is only a quick drive away from all the sights in Monterrey. We used it as a base for day trips to Big Sur and other close-by places and would highly recommend others visiting Monterrey to stay here."
15165034,216634963,2017-12-04,10880404,Tarek,"great spot, very close to everything, really can't go wrong booking here. Thanks for being great hosts"

15165034,222047592,2017-12-28,113588660,Cecilia,"Josh and Angi's place was in a convenient and in a super location!  Angi is very thoughtful with all that she leaves for you - fresh water and glasses, fresh fruit, coffee and organic half and half, and more - just delightful!  The bed was comfortable and we all rested well.  I knew in advance that it would be snug for us, but definitely heed the other reviews - this wonderful place is best for TWO people, or a couple with a small child or two.  We are a family of two young men (a 15 year old football player 6'2"" and a 12 year old basketball player  5'8"") and two parents, and had 4 large suitcases with us.  We couldn't move in the room, especially once the folding bed was opened and we set up one kid in the closet floor.  Again, it's a GREAT place, but just suggest smaller children (lol) or just perfect and cozy for a couple.  :-)  Hubby and I would definitely come back (alone-lol)!"
15165034,223803406,2018-01-01,114530422,Scott,Nice private room at back of property. Host is very nice and accommodating. Can come and go as you please. Can't ask for more out of a private room.

Il n'en est rien, la maison de Josh et Angi est très bien située et l'on accède à tout sans difficultés (en voiture ou à vélo). C'est un très bon choix pour séjourner dans la région."

15165034,242381366,2018-03-11,45833728,Natasha,This cozy room has all the needed amenities of a 5 Star hotel. Tasty hostess decor touch was absolutely more than we excepted. The host's Airbnb listing pictures do not fully reflect how lovely this place is. Great job!

15165034,245551111,2018-03-22,27482772,Lane,"Good location for seeing places in the area.  We were provided with freah fruit, cereal and cream plus coffee and tea in the room.  If it has been nice tere was a sitting area we could have enjoyed."
15165034,247814337,2018-03-29,25506657,Katherine,"Josh and Angi's place was lovely! It was perfect for a quick vacation in Monterey with my sister. The room had everything we needed, including a comfy bed, a mini fridge and microwave, a coffee maker, and a beautiful, secluded patio. Josh and Angi were very accommodating and kind hosts. Thanks for a great stay!"
15165034,248090305,2018-03-30,46294526,Davina,"Great place, clean and (Website hidden by Airbnb) described. We arrived quite late after a long drive and Angi & Josh were very accommodating. Nice little touches like the coffee/ tea/ water and breakfast in the room were also appreciated. Thanks for a comfortable stay!"

15205029,112804883,2016-11-07,37451703,Michele,"Our stay at Sea la Vie Cottage was simply idyllic.  The home and all Alisa's small details were spot on.  It is the perfect size for 2 people.  It is wonderful that she allows dogs, but due to space constraints and not much yard space, I wouldn't recommend a large dog.  Our pup was perfect.  Thank you, Alisa for the cute puppy package you left! We loved the proximity to town and the beach.  The neighborhood was quiet and we hardly ever had to even get into our car!  We very much enjoyed having coffee in the courtyard every morning as the sun rose.  The evenings next to the fireplace were simply relaxing and comfortable.  All of the furnishings were high end, yet casual and comfortable.  The cottage was immaculate. The small touches such as a wine and cheese plate, fresh fruit and crackers were all greatly appreciated.  I hate to leave such a glowing review, because that only means it will be more difficult to rent next time!
Thanks again for offering this wonderful little cottage for our short little weekend vacation.  Everything was superb!
"
15205029,114473270,2016-11-18,24702466,Rod,What a great little house and a killer location to downtown Pacific Grove.  Had a great stay. Thanks Alisa for being such a great host. 
15205029,116071258,2016-11-27,27538368,Gloria,My husband and I recently stayed here with our 9-month old baby girl. It was a great place for her - plenty to explore but without anything she could really break or hurt herself on. Alisa was even nice enough to leave us a high chair for the weekend. This was a lovely cozy cottage and very walkable to town and the beach.  The place was very clean and had all of the amenities we needed for a weekend trip.  I definitely recommend! 
15205029,122606084,2016-12-24,64956683,Mary,"Alisa is a wonderful host, providing nice extra touches and is readily available.    We stayed with her for 27 days while we were out of our own home getting some work done on it.  Alisa provided a fairly complete kitchen which made it easy to make ourselves at home.  There was even a shared washer and dryer for our use.  With a sunny outside seating area and the gas fireplace inside,  Sea La Vie cottage makes a cozy place to hang out."
15205029,122929361,2016-12-26,68516418,William,This is a small but very cute and well equipped cottage.  Quiet street.  Easy walking to central Pacific Grove.  The owners are accommodating of dogs.  My wife says she is definitely coming back.  I hope she brings me again.
15205029,123318174,2016-12-28,5790600,Nathan,A beautiful and cozy cottage with many thoughtful touches. We loved sitting by the fire and enjoyed the snacks that were provided. Alisa was very friendly and hospitable. This was a bit of splurge for us but we felt extremely happy with our experience.
15205029,123796536,2016-12-30,19573245,Veronica,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the cottage for 2 nights while driving up the PCH over the holidays.  We were looking to stay somewhere close enough to to do a day trip to Big Sur and be back in time to enjoy the sunset at Spanish Bay.  This location was perfect! The cottage is nestled in on a quiet street. The area is residential but very close to the center of town Pacific Grove and a 5 mins drive to Spanish Bay Resort. It was private, cozy, and country chic. The pictures absolutely did not do it justice.  The house was very warm and accommodating for our romantic vacation.  The fireplace was just what we needed after a long day of hiking and the bed just sucks you in - literally.  There is a private parking space - so you dont have to worry about parking your car, but you will probably need a car to get around.  Alisa was also just the perfect host. She communicated with me via text, kept us up to date as to when the cottage would be available, gave us restaurant suggestions and even left us a bottle of wine and cheese and fruit platter, which we LOVED! Would totally go back and stay more than two nights.  "
15205029,124820593,2017-01-02,45159850,Karen,Wonderful and cozy cottage!  We loved it and the host Alisa made it a great weekend!  Thank you Alisa!
15205029,125612951,2017-01-06,101414048,Stacy,Beautiful area and comfortable cottage. Restaurants and shops within walking distance from cottage. The area and scenery is so peaceful. 
15205029,127361911,2017-01-17,27288346,Brad,"If your looking for a central location in Monterey, pacific grove, stay here. 
This place has everything you want and more and is very private. You won't regret it. "

15205029,129206075,2017-01-29,21734999,Aurora,"I almost don't want to write a review because I want Sea La Vie to be my own little hidden treasure! ;-] This is a charming, inviting cottage in a great location! Alisa is a wonderful host with clear communications/notes, and provides a well stocked, clean and tidy cottage, with lots of thoughtful touches and amenities. I'm a native of the Monterey Bay Area (now living in Portland, OR) and can attest that the cottage's location is a perfect jumping off point for any adventure in the area. I'm already thinking about my next stay here (hopefully by this fall). "
15205029,130575964,2017-02-06,114265433,Rob,"Perfect Escape. 

Sea la Vie cottage was just perfect for a weekend trip to Monterey. On the west side of Pacific Grove, the crowds are smaller and there isn't much in the way of through traffic, meaning it was quiet and peaceful, but still offered excellent access to the offerings of PG, and Cannery Row. Great access to trails and parks and importantly for us, dog friendly! 

Our host, Alisa, made the place feel like home from the instant we got there. We can't wait to come back again. 

"
15205029,133179056,2017-02-20,107888455,Brooks,Very pleased with our stay at the cottage. The location is convenient to local shops and restaurants. Alisa was great to work with and very helpful. If we are ever back in the area we will stay here again! 
15205029,135175563,2017-03-03,6742989,Lauren,"We loved the cottage! Very well appointed and walkable to beach, aquarium, and restaurants. Wonderful getaway full of walks, dogs, sea otters, and views."
15205029,140774714,2017-03-31,6808362,Robin,"The lovely cottage was perfect for my husband and me along with our golden retriever Wilma. Perfect location for walking to coffee, restaurants, grocery, and lover's point. Clean, quiet neighborhood, and easy communication with Alisa. Hope to return some day. "
15205029,144889382,2017-04-16,4898554,Melody,Adorable spot. Very clean and warm. Alisa is a great communicator and the process was smooth. 
15205029,146385794,2017-04-22,1277485,Pia,"Lovely cottage, we were there three nights and I wish it could have been more.  Love the light in the cottage, the comfy sofa, the comfy+++ mattress, the patio, and the location.  Everything was thoughtfully arranged and Alisa was very helpful.  A perfect rental!  When we come back to Pacific Grove, this is where we'll want to be."
15205029,156140398,2017-05-29,43009989,Karen,My husband and our 8 month pup had a wonderful stay at the cottage for Memorial Day weekend.  Alisa went above and beyond with thoughtful touches to the house.  We hope we can visit again soon!
15205029,157851173,2017-06-04,9030820,Christina,"We enjoyed our stay at the cottage it's walkable to the ocean and restaurants in town. The cottage, patio, and garden where all very charming. The nice tub and little treats were unexpected and lovely. "
15205029,159689576,2017-06-11,123636397,Joel,Comfy digs great hospitality close to shore and restaurants. Great find! 
15205029,166207804,2017-07-03,78195136,Aarron,"We had a wonderful stay in Alisa's cottage. Quiet, secluded, private but just a few blocks from downtown Pacific Grove. Walking just a couple of blocks to a world class dinner at Passionfish was a nice treat. The cottage beautiful and met our every need. Alisa provided a welcome basket for our dog and was very accommodating of pets.  It was great to walk the to the beach and then relax on the enclosed patio while our pooch napped. We look forward to coming back!"
15205029,167400374,2017-07-06,72221445,David,It is a lovely and very comfortable cottage.  Downtown Pacific Grove is just a quick stroll away.
15205029,175779549,2017-07-29,8579164,Alexey,"Three of us spend a few wonderful days and the cottage and we have enjoyed every moment of it! Everything that we needed was at our disposal, and I can say that Alisa takes a great care of every possible need of her guests - so you can enjoy your stay without thinking about little things!
Would happy to stay there again!"
15205029,178989195,2017-08-06,2465553,Laura,a nice place enjoyed the fireplace and garden tub a couples retreat
15205029,185376490,2017-08-21,106209519,Brian,A beautiful little cottage within walking distance of downtown PG.  Alisa is a great host - easy instructions and everything where it should be.
15205029,196590976,2017-09-23,145413493,Sherry,"My husband and I stayed here for a week. It was our first time to the area. The cottage couldn't have been more perfect. It was a cozy retreat just the right size for two. It was furnished with everything and there was a nice note and welcome treat of wine, crackers and cheese when we arrived. The little courtyard was a beautiful place to relax in the afternoons with a glass of wine and to watch the butterflies and humming birds buzz around. We enjoyed the Pacific Grove area. It was quieter and more relaxing than the touristy Monterey.  It was an easy walk to several good restaurants. It was also a quick drive over to Carmel and HW1. If we get lucky enough to return to this area, we will definately see if the cottage is available. I can't think of any negatives."
15205029,214883738,2017-11-26,2153567,Connie,This was our very first Airbnb experience ever and it exceeded our expectations. Alisa is a wonderful host. Her attention to detail on everything this cottage has to offer was superb. We felt as if we were staying at a friend's place and not a rental. You can not beat the location either. Walking distance to many of the best things Pacific Grove has to offer including great shopping and very good restaurants. We would most definitely stay here again on our next visit.
15205029,218038569,2017-12-10,1121183,Mark,"Definitely a gem. You can tell a lot of attention to detail went into the cottage - from bath salts to fresh flowers to everything you need in the kitchen. The bed is comfortable (we slept great, mattress is soft, not firm). Location is great. You’ll be in a quiet neighborhood yet just a few short blocks from the heart of Pacific Grove shops & restaurants (5 min walk), or reach the waterfront in 6 min. A 20 min walk will get you to Cannery Row and the aquarium. Alisa lives on the same block & shared some local tips.
Bottom line: we would definitely return."
15205029,219917281,2017-12-19,29036927,BIll,"This is a very nice place and Alisa is very easy to work with. The place had everything we needed, was close to the town center, so we could walk to meals and shopping. I's also near to the bay , so it's an easy walk, just down a few blocks to the waterfront.

We highly recommend this place."
15205029,222425040,2017-12-29,109865874,Mike,"Very nice stay in a great location. The cottage has quality bedding, electronics, and other things that we enjoyed.  The cottage was spotlessly clean.  The aquarium passes were a nice touch. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks."
15205029,236251597,2018-02-18,79262231,Matt,Great spot! 5 stars across the board.
15205029,244474790,2018-03-18,73862849,Shaun,Quite with convenient location to downtown and Lovers Point. Great home base for sight seeing as well. The place itself is charming. Perfect for a romantic getaway.
15205029,245819054,2018-03-23,42609341,Carol,"Location, location!  Love the wonderful neighborhood. The cottage is comfortable, clean, and tastefully decorated. The small yard was perfect for our 13 year old greyhound. We hope to be back."
15205029,247243065,2018-03-27,789551,Maria,"I had high expectations because of the extremely positive reviews but Alisa's cottage is really just perfect.  The location is terrific - easy to walk to the Bay or into super-cute Pacific Grove or Monterey - also a really nice jumping off spot for driving down to Big Sur or Carmel.  The cottage is comfortable, cozy, and extremely charming; it had everything we needed.  My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer."
15205029,252456505,2018-04-10,16156732,Meghan,"What a great little spot! We had never even heard of Pacific Grove, but are so glad we chose to stay here on our trip to Monterey. It ended up being our favorite of the towns on the peninsula (Monterey, Carmel, PG), which are all very easily accessible from here. We enjoyed the comfy bed, lovely outdoor spaces, relaxing soaking tub and cozy fireplace. A highlight of our trip was walking along the beach path from Pacific Grove into the Cannery Row area and watching the seals enjoy their natural habitat. Lots of great restaurants in the area including Passionfish, just down the street. We hope to return!"
15205029,254049783,2018-04-15,5480512,Shannon,"Wonderful place.  Very spacious cottage with plenty of room for two and a dog.  Alisa was so easy to communicate with and left some beautiful extra touches for us, including wine and cheese, and a basket of bowls and blankets for the dog.  Good kitchen and great bathroom -- the tub is amazing. Really great location, too-- Pacific Grove is so sweet and quiet, a great break from the noise and traffic of Monterey and the congestion of Carmel.  We were there for Good Old Days, which was very sweet, and saw Meryl Streep's trailer (filming had started for Big Little Lies, near Lover's Point).  We will definitely stay again.  Thanks Alisa!"
15328797,110985807,2016-10-29,31999735,Tina,"Jesse's cottage was truly a gem in Monterey! Contact was easy and fast from the day we booked, getting access to the property was also super easy. The cottage is just as seen in the photos and as described with a well stocked kitchen, plenty of clean fresh towels, and beds that were comfortable and clean. He even left biscotti and some welcome snacks upon our arrival. It is in a more historical part of Pacific Grove walking distance to many restaurants and just a quick 5 minute drive to either Lovers Point or Asilomar Beach right at the beginning of the 17 mile drive. The 2 guest passes to Monterey Aquarium were a huge bonus as well. We had 3 adults and 1 child, although the size of the house isn't huge, it was perfect for our small family with my mom. We truly enjoyed our stay, thanks Jesse!"
15328797,111560445,2016-10-31,11461031,Linh,"We had a great time staying at this cottage.  Jesse was very responsive and friendly.  Bedding was very comfortable and warm.  We have a toddler, the minimal amount of stuffs at the cottage was very desirable for us, the fire place even has a safety guard, outlets have outlet covers.  "
15328797,112633749,2016-11-06,13532951,Megan,"What a wonderful cottage in Pacific Grove! We loved staying in Jesse's beautiful, comfortable cottage. Had everything we needed, Jesse was available for questions and suggestions, and the location could not have been better. We loved being able to use the members passes to the aquarium, too! "
15328797,113761442,2016-11-13,3422246,Clément,"We absolutely loved this cute and comfortable cottage, its convenient location (café around the block, ocean at walking distance, 5 min drive to Trader Joe's and 10 min drive to Monterey), the fully equipped kitchen that allowed us to painlessly cook most of our meals, and enough room for up to 5 people. We had a couple of extra requests and Jesse was very accommodating."
15328797,115208333,2016-11-22,59661976,Michael,"My wife, two small kids, and I took a few day get-away to Monterey and stayed at Jesse's cottage. The cottage is located on a quiet street, a block away from restaurants and a short walk to Lover's Point. We even walked with our sporty five year old to the Aquarium on one of the days there. The cottage is the right size with the appropriate amenities for our stay. It's very clean and free from clutter, as it appears to be mainly used for renting.  The house carries much of the charm of the era it was built (late 1800s?), with some of the expected drawbacks. The windows are single pane, like on nearly all houses in the area, but the quiet street, mild ocean climate, forced air heater, and warm bedding make it a non-issue. It was fun to ponder how the original owners used the rooms.  We would definitely stay here again."
15328797,116673067,2016-12-02,3826473,Mary,Great job Jesse on hosting. Lovely little place in awesome location. Highly recommended. 
15328797,120782395,2016-12-11,6447182,Zack,This was a perfect neighborhood for visiting the area. Walking distance to many sights and restaurants. Beds were very comfortable. It was definitely charming although a little funkier than we expected.
15328797,121918086,2016-12-19,95737638,Ella,"Friendly hosts who were happy to help, gave us some great tips on where to go and what to see on our route. Lovely cottage to arrive at - highly recommended "
15328797,122311144,2016-12-22,720051,Sarah,Was super easy to check in/out and in a great location!  We took our 2 year old to the aquarium also and having the passes was such a treat.  Jesse was available and checked in on us to make sure we were settled.
15328797,123532160,2016-12-29,108597503,Jacob,"Great cottage, perfect for our family of 4. Good location and excellent value with included aquarium passes."

15328797,126173188,2017-01-09,17252442,Michael,"Lovely house and neighborhood.  It was a very comfortable stay for my wife, in-laws and myself.  The weather during our trip was pretty rough.  We ended up spending more quality, family time indoors.  There was plenty of room for the four of us.  Jesse was very responsive to all of our questions, and had included a binder with lots of local recommendations and info."
15328797,127230412,2017-01-16,61712366,Smitha,We had a great time. Perfect location and well organized home. Would defiantly stay again!! 
15328797,127479372,2017-01-18,25974085,Julee,Great place for our family of three and father-in-law. We made good use of the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes and walked all around Pacific Grove. 
15328797,128957649,2017-01-28,2591563,Leah,"This was a great place to stay for our conference in Asilomar, thanks Jesse!"
15328797,129409242,2017-01-30,6377613,Leah,"This is my idea of a perfect Airbnb experience.  Great communication with the host, tidy and simple accommodations in a convenient, quiet location.  This is an adorable cottage in a neighborhood full of adorable cottages.  It was perfect for two adults and two kids, kitchen had all the basics and there was plenty to explore within walking distance, including the fabulous Monterey Bay Aquarium. The two guest passes were a nice perk, much appreciated! Jesse is a great host. He even stopped by to help when we (embarrassingly) couldn't figure out how to make the heat come on.  Highly recommended!!"
15328797,131607562,2017-02-12,113921754,Hemaxi,"The cottage was absolutely beautiful! The perfect location, aquarium passes, and helpful hosts helped make for a great weekend girls trip. Very clean and comfortable stay, and easy check-in/check-out. A range of restaurants, scenic drives, activities, and nightlife is no more than a 15 minute drive. Would highly recommend!"
15328797,132921399,2017-02-19,21871394,Maribel,"Great location, within walking distance of restaurants and the beautiful coastline.  Superbly clean and comfortable! "
15328797,133329535,2017-02-21,17012380,Carolyn,"We really enjoyed staying here. We traveled with our two daughters 2.5 & 2mos. Note a pack n play won't really fit in the master, we used a cosleeper. The space had everything we needed and I loved the bedding. It's a beautiful was to lovers point and downtown. Jesse was a great host, he was happy to share info about that area and came by with a headlamp when the power went out.


Super charming and fun, would love to visit again."
15328797,133784077,2017-02-24,42221672,Katherine,"The cottage is charming and the beds were so comfortable I wanted to take mine home. We didn't need to get in our cars because everything we wanted was within walking distance, including the aquarium. There is a great coffee shop and bookstore just at the end of the street. The kitchen was modern and well equipped. The neighborhood was very quiet. It was everything we had hoped for and more. "
15328797,134716713,2017-02-28,61458649,Andrea,"We loved our stay! We are a family of five and we were in the Monterey area to celebrate our oldest daughter's birthday. We let her pick the house and she thought that this home looked cute online. None of us were disappointed.

Location:
The location was awesome. The street itself is quiet. There are darling bakeries, cafes, restaurants and shops that were very easy to walk to. We had a friend recommend a bakery called Pavel's Backerie. To our surprise it was only a couple of blocks away and our daughters enjoyed the giant sized donut!

You can hop in the car and be at the Aquarium in under 10 minutes. Jesse also included two passes for our use! 

Beautiful beaches are all around! Asilomar was a lot of fun to go tide pooling. Although it was closed during our stay this time around, Lovers Point is a beach our kiddos generally really enjoy. 17 mile drive is one of my personal favorites and all of these locations are a very short drive from Jesse's cottage. I don't think we could have chosen a better location. 

The cottage:
Charming, clean and cozy. Jesse really did provide everything you would need to just bring your clothes and relax. The kitchen was well equipped with all the modern amenities. There was a washer and dryer, which for all you moms out there is an AWESOME perk.

Honestly, one of the very best things for me is that we left our 3 year old sons most loved stuffed animal at Jesse's cottage. We got home and realized what we had done and I immediately emailed him with a HUGE request to look for the tiger and mail it to us if at all possible. He responded to me very quickly and once he found our beloved tiger he let me know it would be in the mail the next day. I don't think you can get any better than that as far as a host goes!  

We loved our stay and were very happy with the cottage and host that we chose! Thanks Jesse!"
15328797,137190845,2017-03-13,58517962,Allison,We loved our stay at Jesse's place! It was very clean and comfortable. We were greeted with fresh flowers and chocolates for our anniversary.  They left us great suggestions of what to do in the area and great places to eat. Pacific Grove is such a sweet town and very welcoming to visitors. Thanks Jesse for a great place to stay. 
15328797,138412480,2017-03-19,51034035,Jonathan,"This was EXCELLENT. Great location and a really cozy and charming cottage, as billed. I hope to stay here for my next time attending an Asilomar event or otherwise. Really awesome. Thank you Jesse!"
15328797,138976192,2017-03-22,3279015,Chris,"Jesse is super helpful and the place is amazing. It was great for our family of four with easy walking to local shops or even down to the Aquarium. Loads of space, plenty of necessities and very kid friendly. Having access to Amazon and Netflix was a huge bonus."

Der Kontakt zu Jesse war sehr herzlich und freundschaftlich. Unsere Familie hat sich sehr wohl gefühlt, und wir werden unbedingt wiederkommen. Thank you, Jesse! "
15328797,140559714,2017-03-30,116148249,Emily,"We loved this cottage! Stayed here with 4 friends for a relaxing couple of days of exploring downtown Monterey, and the Aquarium. It was the perfect location (walking distance from Lover's Point, lots of restaurants, and downtown). Some of the comfiest beds we've ever slept on! The cottage itself is lovely, and a very cozy place to hang out at in the evenings. Even with 5 people, we didn't feel cramped. We loved the backyard seating and the porch. Little touches like snacks and recommendations for nearby activities really made it perfect! Thanks, Jesse, for being a great host!  "
15328797,141330267,2017-04-02,110170221,Jessica,"With three adults and 2 little kids this house was great! The neighborhood was quiet and the house was so cute. We appreciated all the little things Jesse had and the aquarium passes were a big plus. 
Thanks again!"
15328797,141926259,2017-04-05,40050227,Jen,"Great place for family vacation, bus, walk, or short drive to many sights! Everything we needed for a stress free getaway."

15328797,148869382,2017-05-01,59458864,Joshua,it's a sunny house to build a great weekend around.  Kitchen table is small so we are in the living room without issue. Plenty of outlets for charging gadgets. We had luck with on street parking but know it's not a guarantee.
15328797,149715226,2017-05-05,121279157,Kristin,The cottage was very cute & comfortable. It had everything our family of 4 needed. It was in a great location to walk to restaurants & the beach. We would definitely recommend it & want to stay again if we were ever in the area. 
15328797,150299263,2017-05-07,116428751,Rori,Great location. Very clean and nice accommodations. My bridesmaids and I had a great time on my bachelorette spa weekend.

15328797,151967799,2017-05-14,4815792,Michael,Excellent cottage exactly as described. Very well equipped and comfortable accommodation. Very easy walking distance to centre of Pacific Grove with a variety of restaurants and little boutiques. A very short drive to more busy Monterey. Would definitely recommend 
15328797,152635186,2017-05-17,116150737,Wendy,"Great location, great house. "
15328797,153690316,2017-05-21,102785981,Janelle,"Jesse's home was quiet, lovely, comfortable, and so close to everything! It was well equipped with kitchen appliances, cable, air, linens, towels... everything you would need for a nice vacation. He was very communicative and nice throughout the process. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to be close to Monterey, but not clustered with all the downtown buzz. It's crazy close to Pacific Grove's coast and only maybe a 5 minute drive to downtown Monterey. "
15328797,155787451,2017-05-28,65281062,Elizabeth,"Couldn't have been happier with this clean, comfy little home ☺️ From the amazing beds to the short walk to the Main Street - our weekend spent here was perfect!"

Hands down would stay again & recommend to others. Thank you for sharing your home. Also, the two tickets/passes to the aquarium was an added bonus & savings. Thanks again. Very nice, quaint place. "
15328797,159300048,2017-06-10,119135311,Heather,"We had a great time in Monterey/Pacific Grove! The house was very clean, with plenty of towels, dishes, etc. Jesse was very responsive and great to work with. The town was easy to walk around with kids and the neighborhood was very quiet.. The kids were able to spend our downtime watching movies.
We are glad we chose to stay in a house rather than a hotel!"
15328797,160351596,2017-06-13,41512722,Olga,Our stay was very enjoyable. The house is in impeccable condition and has everything one needs. The location is amazing... just a short walk to the ocean. Thank you for a chance to stay at such a wonderful place! 
15328797,161345799,2017-06-17,129257487,Thomas,"This small cabin was ideal for our family vacation to Pacific Grove, Monterey, and Carmel by the Sea.  The cabin is clean, comfortable, and has a nice washer and dryer which we used for towels and clothing.  We chose to not cook on our vacation, but we did use the microwave and some of the kitchen gear for reheating leftovers for dinner after having our main meal one day at lunch.  My wife enjoyed sitting in the sun among the flowers in the back yard during some down time.  The location is ideal for a vacation to this region.  The cabin is less than one block from several restaurants in Pacific Grove, including a couple of good places for coffee and pastries.  The owners provide a pair of guest pass cards for Monterey Bay Aquarium (about one mile away).  Our children (10 and 12) enjoyed the aquarium and also the tide pools at Asilomar Beach, which is also only a little over one mile from the cabin.  We moved to the West Coast less than one year ago and have many other spots on our list for vacations, but we plan to go back to Pacific Grove eventually and hopefully stay at the same place.

"
15328797,163378803,2017-06-24,121582238,Elizabeth,Great location and the house is very clean and quiet.  We were four people and that was a bit tight with one bathroom but it worked out fine.  Very nice to be able to walk to everything and we enjoyed the streaming tv as we don't have that where we live.  We liked the tips about the restaurants and enjoyed our trips to the Big Sur area and to Moss landing.   The kids had a great time at Jazz Camp so we might be back next year!
15328797,165091041,2017-06-30,328459,Alana,"We stayed for 5 nights at Jesse's place and it was incredibly convenient to all we wanted to see and do while in the area - coffee and cookies from the corner cafe/bookstore, splashing in the water at Lover's Point, searching for sea creatures in the tide pools at Asilomar, wandering through Carmel, jogging along the ocean. The house is basic but has everything you need, especially peace and quiet. On top of it all, Jesse is an absolute gem of a guy. Book the cottage! You won't be disappointed."
15328797,166090378,2017-07-02,113135040,Julie,Jesse thought of everything. We had a wonderful experience. Great location and the perfect layout for our family. So glad we chose this cottage. 
15328797,166757988,2017-07-04,65911722,Corinne,Great location to downtown Pacific Grove and a short walk to the ocean. House was a good  fit for our family of four.

Jesse was accesible is needed kitchen had everything you need. Enjoyed staying in Pacific Grove away from the crowds in Monterey. The basket of goodies, OJ in fridge and washer and dryer were great additions. Would definitely recommend staying there."

15328797,170054319,2017-07-14,29812546,Michael,Lovely cosy cottage in a good location for Pacific Grove. Clean and comfortable with all that we needed. Good communication with the host and easy check in and out. Parking in the street outside worked well. We had a really good stay in this welcoming place!
15328797,173064566,2017-07-22,120387507,Casey,"This was a fantastic location for everything Pacific Grove and Monterey!  We were minutes from Lover's Point, Asilomar, and Del Monte beach.  We enjoyed the FREE guest tickets (2) to the aquarium very much!
Jesse came over on bike to check on us and make sure everything went okay with checking into the property.  He was very friendly and knowledgeable, sharing information about grocery stores, restaurants, etc. (He also had a binder full of information about the area inside!)
The cottage was comfortable for myself and 2 young children.  The beds were great, the kitchen was VERY well stocked (tin foil, butter, olive oil--little things that make a huge difference!), and we had plenty of clean towels to last a week.
We did have an issue with the heat not kicking on for us in the early morning, and it gets chilly in Pacific Grove!  Otherwise, a great stay--we would highly recommend this location for the cost if you're visiting the area."
15328797,174103396,2017-07-24,122566651,Lanelle,"Totally recommended for a small family.  Much to do around there!  Owner leaves passes to aquarium! Nice touch.  Highly recommended.

The picturesque cottage is much bigger than we anticipated due to the fab high ceilings. It was perfect for us, a family of 4 and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. The aquarium passes were an added bonus and saved us 💰 money getting in.  Jesse was helpful and responsive.  The washing machine and dryer were an added benefit for us as we are on a longish road trip.  Would definitely recommend."

15328797,193765094,2017-09-14,39397255,Melissa,This charming little house was perfect for us to explore the Monterey area. Just about a mile walk along the water to the aquarium (and two free passes!!!!) and just down the lock from countless restaurants and shops.  We were traveling with a little one so the fully equipped kitchen and the bath tub made our lives easier.
15328797,195285780,2017-09-18,5243559,Susan,"Great place, excellent cottage. Very short walk to the beach and restaurants."

Not only was it close to everything you may want to see and do in Monterey/Carmel, the house is warm and welcoming!  You want to stay here - guaranteed!  Our host thought of everything - soaps in the bathroom, coffee, little snacks, two aquarium tour passes, down to the creamer needed to go in said coffee!  Jesse is great, and if we go to the area again, we will be staying with him.  Hands down."

I thoroughly recommend Jesse’s house."

Jesse was a tremendous host, very easy to work with and responsive.  He gave us great recommendations that really enhanced our stay.

Close to the Aquarium, Monterey activities, a great business district of its own, the 17-mile drive, and the artists in Carmel. The home was thoughtfully equipped and extremely comfortable, especially the (unusual) King Bed!! Jesse was very responsive to our inquiries and the perfect host. We'll be back!"

He provided items such as things to do in Pacific Grove, and items to make our stay much more simple, such as coffee, dish and laundry soap, shampoo and conditioner. The place was super clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. Although we didn't have time to use them, he also had some aquarium guest passes available for our use. The key was easily accessible, parking and other directions were clear, and he responded quickly to any questions we had. The location was great-just a brief walk down to the coast. There also was a cute backyard with a bench to have your morning coffee. We were so happy staying here!"

The cottage itself was the perfect size and layout for our family of 4. The kids really appreciated the snacks and cereal that Jesse set out for us, too. Someone else may have mentioned this, but the online pics don't do justice to the place- it is way cuter and cozier than I was expecting. Highly recommend!"
15328797,247774085,2018-03-29,167161115,Alan,The cottage was perfect for our family of 4 and we absolutely loved Pacific Grove! Communication in advance of arrival was very good and the recommendations Jesse made significantly enhanced our trip. We strongly recommend walking to the Monterey Bay Aquarium via the beach front path from Lovers Point and enjoying dinner at Passionfish.
15328797,249724747,2018-04-02,44253653,Debbie,"The little cottage was a great place for our family of 4 to rest for a couple of nights. 
The house had everything we needed and was well stocked. Little touches like having coffee and filters/detergent and dryer sheets/etc was extremely helpful. 
The house is on a quiet street. Parking is on street and no reserved spots. We were there on a busy weekend and never had a problem getting a spot right in front of the house. 
The house is within walking distance of restaurants and a small local grocery store. 
Jesse is extremely easy to communicate with and responds quickly to questions. 
Pictures of the house are accurate and it was very clean. 
If we ever come back to Pacific Grove/Monterey area, I would definitely stay at Jesses place again."
15328797,250612647,2018-04-05,19897732,Mango,A very nice house and super quiet neighborhood in a perfect location to reach every part of Pacific Grove. Jesse is very considerate host and prepared everything we needed. This house is very clean and better in person than in the pictures. We really enjoy the stay here.
15328797,251294436,2018-04-07,104654076,Anna,"I only wish we had longer to stay in Pacific Grove. Our first impressions of Jesse’s cottage lasted throughout our whole stay.

Whilst close to numerous restaurants, bars, cafes and shops, the house was on a quiet residential street.

Inside the cottage was lovely. It seemed much bigger inside and what you would think from the front. From comfortable living room chairs, to a dining table that was large enough for the four of us, a fully stocked kitchen, and utility room with washer and dryer we could not have asked for more.

There was plenty of hot water and great shower, heating if we needed it and the most comfortable bed I think we have ever slept in everything was perfect. 

Easy walking distance to Lovers point and the aquarium made things easy with our 2 children - cannot give a higher recommendation. 

Thank you"
15328797,252691295,2018-04-11,166018068,Carl,"It was a clean and comfortable house.  It was one block away from shops and restaurants.  It was about 1/2 mile to the beach.  My wife and I would recommend this place to others, and we would certainly stay here again."

15522012,109634559,2016-10-22,32226512,Steven,"My family and I needed a place to stay on our way down the coast and Jeanie was incredibly accommodating. The place was inviting and peaceful, we enjoyed the outdoor fire pit and hammock and couldn't have asked for a more relaxing evening. Would recommend!"
15522012,111314304,2016-10-30,3127033,Karen,Jeanie's cottage has everything you need in a very convenient location.  The cottage is absolutely quaint and charming especially the backyard with firepit.  Jeanie was so helpful and responsive.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  The best part is that Big Sur is not so far away for tons of nature/outdoor activity and then you can come back to the cottage for a comfy by-the-sea feel.  Really the best of both worlds!
15522012,112637365,2016-11-06,44094657,Corine,"My entire process from booking to checkout was enjoyable. The property is conveniently located near the beach, parks, grocery stores, the aquarium, and more. The cottage had endless amenities and Jeanie was the perfect host with numerous recommendations. I recommend this place for anyone!"
15522012,113762602,2016-11-13,477615,Michael,Excellent host--very thoughtful. Charming house--awesome backyard. 10 minute walk form the beach. Will come back. 
15522012,114918217,2016-11-20,9951343,Jessica,"Loved our stay here. Jeanie was very accommodating, easy to communicate with and the listing was exactly as described. It was cozy and perfect for us."
15522012,115733220,2016-11-26,16303663,Adrienne,"Jeanie's cottage was a wonderful getaway for my family of four Thanksgiving weekend for a great value! Quick walk to the beach, secluded family fires in the back yard, and great for charcoal grilling dinners!  Walking to Pacific Grove and Monterey downtown is a lovely couple mile walk along the ocean.  Dogs live here as we were told, but I wouldn't have guessed it as it was clean and smelled great.  Love the decor - Jeanie has awesome taste and was so kind and inviting to my family!"
15522012,120462829,2016-12-10,3191853,Melissa,Jeanie was so hospitable and we loved staying in her beautiful home! It really felt like entering our own home away from home. Her notes about the house and nearby attractions were really helpful. She was very prompt with her communication. We would love to come back! She even left us some dog toys for our pup! 
15522012,123779666,2016-12-30,83414015,Tamsen,"Jeanie is a great and responsive host. The home was beautiful both inside and out, with a lot of time put into detail and function. Great place to go for a relaxing weekend or work get-away. It was so nice to have my dog with me on the trip and Jeanie even left her some dog treats. Highly recommend Jeanie's home as a place to stay and will keep it on our radar for future travels!"
15522012,124370120,2017-01-01,73957599,H,"Cozy and nice place. In addition to full equipment, some foods are provided in a fridge. Great hospitality. "
15522012,128158665,2017-01-22,3143949,Henish,What a great house to stay at!  Real cozy and all the amenities of a regular home.  Want to play games?  She's got them.  Cooking meals?  You've got all the stuff you need (and grocery is only a 5 minute drive).  Some rentals are houses owned by people that never visit the house.  This is a special home and I can tell that Jeanie and her family use the home themselves.  That makes the experience so much better.  
15522012,128943274,2017-01-28,108367272,Joshua,Great little Seaside Cottage very cozy with all the amenities you need and a gracious host made our stay perfect
15522012,130409707,2017-02-05,60546389,Pooja,20 min walk from most shops / restaurants. Beautiful indoors and outside. Loved the fireplace. Thanks for the aquarium passes!!
15522012,131591542,2017-02-12,4050122,Jelly,"Cozy beach cottage with a lively artsy touch, and enchanting garden. Walking distance to the beach and to restaurants. We had a lovely stay with my parents and our 5 month old"
15522012,135699398,2017-03-05,25203143,Pedram,"We didn't have a chance to meet Jeanie in person but I can say she is the nicest person ever! Our plan was to stay but we got there super late as our car broke down on road. She was very communicative and we had a pleasant late check in. Place was very clean, nice and quiet and the description was very accurate. Top host, highly recommended:)"
15522012,138380306,2017-03-19,12974004,Brian,One of the very best hosts I've had on Airbnb.  Called us into the aquarium for visit after a long trip with two toddlers in the car.  The Pebble Beach pass is super cool for a free trip on 17 mile.  Place was wonderful and stylish and funky.  Super close to Asilomar.  My wife loved the outside shower and the expansive tea selection.  Also was great to build a fire outside.  Hope to come again next year hopefully late summer early fall  for more than one night.
15522012,139872948,2017-03-26,115713419,Mollie,"Jeanie provided a lovely cottage that we now call  ""The Magic Mermaid Cottage"".  We were comfortable and enjoyed the privacy. We walked from the cottage to Lover's Point through a beautiful neighborhood.  We particularly enjoyed Jeanie's garden out back - hammocks, fire pit, and flowers.  Jeanie was quite accommodating and flexible."

She has a beautiful secret garden full of hidden treasures. The fire pit was wonderful at night. Location was great And she had many wonderful suggestions for us. We got to use her aquarium passes and parking passes. Would recommend this to anyone staying in the area."
15522012,142328893,2017-04-07,34865745,Andy,"Great stay in a cute, upscale cottage! Would definitely recommend this place. Jeanie was an excellent hostess and was very communicative and helpful. Would love to have had a longer stay!"
15522012,142942724,2017-04-09,96590241,Erica,Absolutely awesome cottage-type home! Beautiful back yard and super chill vibe inside. Will definitely be back if we visit Monterey again :)
15522012,144799316,2017-04-16,292313,Bob,Jeanie is a great host and her cottage is a fantastic retreat for a casual weekend. We brought kids and dog. Short drive to Carmel  which is some kind of dog paradise. Take Jeanie's advise on the bagpipes and the bagels. Lovely back yard space with fire pit and hammocks. Lots of board games inside if it starts to rain. We'll be back!
15522012,145935054,2017-04-20,110728940,Pfilipa,This is a wonderful place.

All bedrooms were cozy, and the cottage is very convenient to 17 mile drive. Jeanie kindly left some trip advices for us. I'll definitely recommend this cottage to my friends. Thank you Jeanie!
房东的小屋相当有特色,室内和花园都经过精心布置,卧室天花板上甚至还有夜光的星星,可以在星空下入睡。房间舒适,干净,小屋离17英里北入口只有几分钟车程,很方便。房东还留给我们许多有用的旅行建议。这是一次非常棒的体验!"
15522012,148380020,2017-04-30,17574618,Lauren,"Jeanie was the perfect host. The cottage accommodated for multiple guests comfortably, was super clean and had a fabulous backyard. We will definitely be coming back!"

15522012,174378863,2017-07-25,137581133,Apple,I've never seen such a great host! Although we faced a small problem with the smoke alarm out of power but the neighbor Mark soon came to help when the host was in town! I really appreciate that Jeanie share such a pleasant place with us. Everything is ready and I can do what every I want. That's cool!! And all the things are truly shown in the pictures she posted.
15522012,222089141,2017-12-28,41742155,Matthew,What an amazing stay we had! The beautiful cottage is like home away from home. Can walk to the beach or drive anywhere in PG or monterey within 10 minutes. Jeanie was extremely accommodating and the house was perfect for us and dogs. Everything we could ever needed and more was provided. The backyard was a quiet Oasis. We will be back!
15522012,223706188,2018-01-01,126705675,Darin,"We stayed at Jeanie's lovely cottage on new year's eve and had such a wonderful time. Her cottage is one of the best airbnb places that we have ever stayed! It is very lovely, cozy, homie, and has everything that you need. 

Jeanie is also a great host. She is very informative about the local areas. She is very well prepared and very thoughtful of her guests to ensure that we have the most enjoyable stay. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone who wants to stay in Monterey area!"
15522012,246644462,2018-03-25,104305748,Mary,Jeanie's place is so awesome! We felt relaxed and welcomed. We will definitely be back!

Perfect for the dogs."
15522012,247814599,2018-03-29,179387631,Nina,We had an amazing time at Jeanie’s cottage. Jeanie made everything very easy and convenient for us and her cottage is just a little paradise!
15522012,249774166,2018-04-02,6082026,Becca,"We rented Jeanie's place for a long weekend to celebrate a birthday with friends and we had a really great time! Jeanie was sooo helpful and responsive in the weeks leading up to our visit, which made planning much easier. The whole time, I really felt like she wanted us to enjoy ourselves -- and we did! The place is lovely and exactly as she described it. I love all of the mermaid decorations. And, small detail, but the shower is excellent, which makes such a difference. The location is great -- I definitely recommend walking through the Asilomar Conference Grounds down to the beach. And the aquarium passes are such a great deal. We would definitely come back!"
15522012,250345706,2018-04-04,22192798,Baroon,The place was smaller than I had expected. The living are and the kitchen is quite small. The front yard and the backyard could do better with some cleaning and decluttering.
15522012,250966506,2018-04-06,16370404,Heather,"We loved our stay at the mermaid cottage. It is cozy and clean, with everything you could possibly need, including: beach towels, tons of pillows, three nice beds, extra blankets, camping chairs, cookware, and even children’s books, games & toys. The washer/dryer (a must with a toddler) and bathroom were particularly new and above average. It is a wonderful space for children with a fenced in yard, carpeting, and plenty to discover. My son was in love with the “little house,” and we were too! Very quick drive, or a pleasant stroll, to downtown pacific heights and (in the other direction) gorgeous beach. Pavel’s, Passion Fish, and the Grove market were three amazing recommendations from our hostess. Thank you Jeanie, we will be back!"
15649395,122310360,2016-12-22,4004136,John,Great house and location.  As described and shown. We really liked Pacific Grove.  Would happily stay again. 
15649395,124793289,2017-01-02,30706345,James,"Our stay at Casa Mariposa was better than we could've imagined. The home was comfortable and felt like we were at home in Pacific Grove. The location is close to everything you'd want to access is Monterey, and a close drive to Big Sur. Jon was very communicative prior to arrival meanwhile allowed us our personal space while staying. Would love to stay again!"

15775735,115435186,2016-11-24,18067665,"Jim,Stacey,Gary,Lynea,Amy,&Michael","I am not sure words can describe how much I adored La Mer cottage. I felt at home the moment I drove up and was welcomed by this cheery, yellow farmhouse with the blue door. Inside, it was warm and inviting, with tons of natural light brightening up every room. The living spaces are all incredibly well laid out and give the cottage a very roomy, yet cozy feel. I could sense the cottage has kept its period charm through the decades, while being upgraded in all the right places. For example, the bathroom has a heated light/fan to keep things warm in the brisk mornings, and the kitchen is completely modern, but harkens back to its farmhouse roots with beautiful rustic shelving and white shiplap walls.

The bedrooms are all incredibly unique — I wanted to sleep in a different one each night! But, my favorite room was the garden room at the very back of the house. Named appropriately since it overlooks the garden, it is quaint and inviting, with a gorgeous green chesterfield. The walls are filled with a collage of botanical prints and vintage maps. I sat in here whenever I could, to enjoy its serene vibe with my morning coffee or evening wine.

The location of the cottage was perfect. The quaint, little residential street sits just a few blocks above downtown Pacific Grove. I could walk everywhere I wanted to go. There is so much to experience on the Central Coast, that I could come back a dozen times and still have more to see and do. The best part of my time here, however, was living like a local is this special little cottage-by-the-sea. Thank you, Michael for creating such a wonderful home to enjoy. I cannot wait to return. 
"
15775735,122043735,2016-12-20,6511966,Anthony, Such a beautiful and charming home. we were greeted with a bottle of wine upon arrival.  Beyond cozy the interiors are amazing.  Wonderful location just steps away from the ocean. 
15775735,122598237,2016-12-24,106531074,Ursula,"My family had a great stay. The space is cozy and was perfect for our two young kids. It felt a lot like our real home.  Very family friendly floor plan- I could see what my kids were up to easily, yet we had plenty of spaces to spread out. There is a nice office/den with a couch plus the real bedrooms. 
Super clean and nicely decorated and well organized. We hope to rerun. "
15775735,122912136,2016-12-26,34380947,Olivier,Very nice wooden cottage in the hill not far from the sea side. Very good location to access Monterey aquarium or the Spanish bay.

15775735,125590659,2017-01-06,4654546,Jennifer,"What a fantastic experience! I never know if vacation digs will match the online photos/description, but this charming place far exceeded our expectations. It was like Anthropologie met the best of HGTV and elevated a little historic seaside cottage to luxe level. We had everything we needed and more. Blown away by the decor, cleanliness and relaxing but high quality vibe of this little bungalo, we left wanting the name of the designer. Every detail was seen to, from the invitingly comfortable beds, seating, and tasteful kitchen supplies to soft bath towels and ample closet space. At once we wanted to entertain her AND keep it all to ourselves. We hope this place will be one we can return to again and again. 

We ventured out a lot during the day (17-mile drive, Aquarium, Carmel-by-th-sea, Point Pinos Lighthouse, Lover's Point and Refuge day spa) but would have been completely happy as shut-ins, reading, relaxing, cooking and enjoying each other's company. This was a nice little respite from the holiday hustle and I give it my highest recommendation. "
15775735,127031940,2017-01-15,14400164,Klara,"Michael's Cottage is perfect. I couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay in, we went for a weekend of touring Big Sur and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The house is beautifully decorated, so comfortable, the beds were like sleeping in clouds and it was such a great location! "
15775735,127375116,2017-01-17,31482644,Elena,"La Mer was absolutely beautiful. Everything was very clean and extremely comfortable. We were really close to the ocean and walked there several times. I couldn't recommend La Mer more. Also, Amy went truly above and beyond for us when we left something behind. As hosts, I would say there are none better. And again, the cottage was absolutely beautiful!"
15775735,127877634,2017-01-21,8828337,Rune,"We really enjoyed our time here! Check-in was easy, communication was quick and precise, the home was cosy, the neighbourhood was quiet and the kitchen well-equipped. 5 stars! "

15775735,133768318,2017-02-24,17240106,Kelly,"La Mer is totally adorable, very nicely decorated, provisioned, and the beds are SO comfortable! The street is very quiet and we slept beautifully. The coffee was a welcome find and it was nice to have a few spices and olive oil already available for cooking. We had a cold and rainy week but the heating system worked wonderfully. The shower was awesome. All in all, we truly enjoyed our week at La Mer and highly recommend it!"
15775735,134311169,2017-02-26,68762472,Sarah,This home is a treasure.  Words cannot express how much my friends and I enjoyed our stay. We ended up staying in more than anticipated because this charming home away from home made us not want to go out.

15775735,139854677,2017-03-26,112415912,Katharina,"Our family of four had a fantastic time at Michael's and Amy's beautiful place. The communication was extraordinary, the location is great, very quiet, close to downtown and the ocean, only a couple of minutes walking. We also had our bikes with us including the chariot for the kids and did a couple of little tours along the sea.
I can join ALL the great comments about the good design of the cottage, the comfortable beds and the well equipped kitchen, one detail not mentioned is that the are also fantastic sharp knives!!! I always bring one little sharp knife, when I stay somewhere else but I did not need it when we stayed at Michael's and Amy's cottage ;) 
We hope to be back soon!"

But a couple of things you should be aware of before booking:
- it is not a cottage, it's a two floor house split in two with separate entrances, so you may have people staying upstairs.

- if you stay in the downstairs part of the house you're not supposed to park in the driveway.

- be aware of the cancellation policy (you get no refund if cancelling within 7 days of arrival)."

It is very charming.  My daughter Ashley said it looked like something in a magazine and loved all the little design touches.  The cottage is a short walk to the beach and incredible views.  The cottage was so magical for the kids that I don't think they ever want to stay in a hotel again.  Our stay was wonderful and unforgettable.  Thank You!"

The beds are super comfy, as is the couch. You'll never want to cook in another kitchen after using the one in La Mer. If backyard drinks in the sunshine are your jam, well you'll have an opportunity to do that. Centrally located and super inviting, this home provides an incredible stay. I can't rave enough about how awesome this house was (loved the bathroom, too!) and how quickly I'd return for another visit. Thank you Michael and Amy!!! This home made my 35th birthday weekend a wonderful experience!"

15775735,155227483,2017-05-27,13635866,Kim,"Pacific Grove is a terrific location! Easy to get to the aquarium on foot, or see the entire Monterey Bay area by car."
15775735,157747022,2017-06-04,91159359,Gabby,"Everything was absolutely amazing! We had a girls weekend and couldn't of had a better experience. It was beautiful, well decorated, and comfortable. If you like cooking they have everything you need too. Really perfect experience and with 5 girls the one bathroom wasn't even an issue. "
15775735,158642687,2017-06-07,1992100,Danielle,Beautiful home in a cozy neighborhood! Loved the decor
15775735,159342691,2017-06-10,121855497,Tracy,Such s cute place for a couple or small family. Great location and very warm and inviting. 
15775735,160378075,2017-06-13,7252732,Noah,"La Mer is wonderfully decorated and conveniently located. We loved the place and the adorable neighborhood, and would definitely stay there again. Anyone worried about noise from the upstairs unit - no need! We met our boisterous upstairs neighbors when they arrived at the same time as us, but hardly knew they were there after. The kitchen is nicely if somewhat minimally equipped - not the best place for gourmet chefs but ideal for breakfast, coffee, and snacks. For parents - there's a playground just a few blocks away! "
15775735,161024097,2017-06-16,114002950,Charlyn,"This is a charming home with great space. Comfortable and cozy- it has almost* everything you need and will dare you not to leave.  

There is an upstairs that could be occupied with guests. *tv is byo cloud apps. "
15775735,162369275,2017-06-20,83889006,Natalie,The location offers a great view of the ocean from the street down the hill. It is very quiet and peaceful. The cottage itself is very cute and quaint. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is very convenient to use. The couch is large and easily fit us all for a game night. It's a lovely place to stay.
15775735,162833310,2017-06-22,29276314,Christopher,"We had a lovely stay at Michael and Amy's place.  The cottage is clean and comfortable and very nicely decorated. It's in a quiet neighborhood that is also quite close to Monterey's main attractions, and there are several nice restaurants within walking distance.  Definitely recommend this place.  "
15775735,164243583,2017-06-26,22451587,Daniel,Beautiful home in a quiet and convenient location.  
15775735,166088612,2017-07-02,59540137,Tiffany,"Le Mer was a stunning retreat for my family of four (me, husband, 2 boys ages 6 & 8). We drove up from Long Beach & couldn't have been more pleased with our accommodations. I felt like I was living in an Anthropologie store (just needed a Capri Blue Candle😜). Beds were comfy & the house was well equipped with everything we needed. We were able to cut costs significantly by cooking in. 
Pacific Grove, where the house is located, is a quiet & serene neighborhood, but everything you need is within walking distance (the aquarium, Cannery Road) & there is plenty to do. It's very close to the Monterey Bay Trail, perfect for running & walking. Very peaceful retreat. Would certainly stay again."
15775735,166869499,2017-07-04,49182285,Michelle,"Adorable, warm home.  We had a wonderful time exploring Pacific Grove and Monterey both on foot and bike.  "
15775735,167679127,2017-07-07,114401895,Nicole,We had a great stay!  The house was just as pictured and it had a great design style and appeal.  The space was good for my husband and I plus our three daughters.  The beds were comfortable - even the pullout couch for my youngest!  The location was residential and parking was never an issue.  I only wish it had been a bit warmer so we could have enjoyed the cute back yard space!   Thanks for allowing us to enjoy your beautiful home!
15775735,171405374,2017-07-17,77601429,Steph,"Great place -- really well cared for. Lots of thoughtful touches. Super comfortable beds. Lovely decor.

15775735,175730165,2017-07-29,121382098,Stephanie,La Mer is a wonderfully quaint and cozy little cottage. Michael & Amy have done a wonderful job decorating and maintaining the home.  La Mer is located within walking distance to some of the must see spots in the Pacific Grove/Monterey area.  The check in and check out process was a breeze. It couldn't have been easier.  We enjoyed our stay in Pacific Grove very much and would love to come back for a visit again. 
15775735,178023947,2017-08-04,39622402,Agnes,"Wonderful home. So clean, perfectly located. We loved everything about it. A special mention about how wonderful and comfortable the beds were, I sleep badly usually and it made a massive difference. Also thanks to Michael and Amy for being so accommodating catering for us when we arrived from Yosemite with a bag full of dirty clothes. We would Iove to return one day."
15775735,182045933,2017-08-13,48778562,Lizzy,great place to stay for an aquarium visit or just a cozy weekend getaway!  The owners were incredible helpful and accommodating:) great walkable central location and the house is super comfy and stunning!
15775735,185375382,2017-08-21,23744251,Brandon,"How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways!
Each year we make the journey from San Diego to Monterey to celebrate in all that is Auto Week and the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.  And each year that trip grows longer.  This year, we had planned eight days.  Now, three people in a small hotel room somewhere around Salinas for that amount of time is no fun and usually results in name calling of some sort.  And then we found Michael & Amy's wonderful cottage.  Actually, wonderful doesn't even begin to describe it.  Just up the hill from the coast (great for morning runs to work off the late night trips to Michael's ... the best Mexican place in Pacific Grove), around the corner from a Starbucks, and within a stones throw from the back gate meant that we were not far from all of our little addictions.  As for the house?  A darling, well stocked kitchen was our hub for several late night bottles of wine and the beds were not only comfortable but ginormous too.  And there was even a little backyard (which we'll use next time.... BBQ!).  All in all, we loved the cottage so much that we're already booking it again for next year!  Thanks again Michael & Amy!"
15775735,186171884,2017-08-23,19303966,Andrew,The cottage is beautifully laid out in a quiet area close to the coast.  We had a great time exploring the area.
15775735,192632112,2017-09-10,5147607,Marian,House was lovely and just as advertised! Beds were unbelievably comfortable as well. A great stay!
15775735,193756650,2017-09-14,38742930,Stephanie,"This house from start to finish is flawless. I thoroughly enjoyed every inch of the home and it was immaculate. The decor, attention to details, complete thought out into every aspect sets this house apart from other rentals. Kudos to super host Amy. She was reliable, so nice and completely helpful with anything we needed. I would highly recommend this lovely charming home."
15775735,196290562,2017-09-22,73463869,Gloria,"Le Mer cottage is lovely and well decorated. I would give the indoor space 5 stars. Unfortunately we were expecting a bit more from the outdoor space. The description was ""The back garden is the perfect place to enjoy morning coffee, afternoon sea breezes, and an evening under the stars.""  It could have been, but the plant area was completely overgrown with weeds and the outdoor furniture had not been cleaned in sometime with dirt, cobwebs, and dead bugs on the table and chairs."
15775735,197132285,2017-09-24,102807040,Stephanie,"We loved our stay at La Mer cottage! The house is absolutely gorgeous and the location was within 2-3 miles of all of our wedding events of the weekend.I just wanted to give a heads up that the ""1 single bed, 1 sofa bed"" listed under Bedroom 3 are referring to the same bed, as there is only one sofa bed in that room (I'm guessing it is just to clarify that the sofa bed is a single, since they are often doubles, but we thought it meant that there was a sofa bed AND a single bed in that room). In any event 5 of us slept comfortably in the house, and the couch in the front room also was very comfortable, so if someone hadn't wanted to share a bed they could have slept there instead.  We will definitely try to stay here again if we come back to visit Pacific Grove/Monterey :)"
15775735,198764300,2017-09-30,9508206,Lisa,The cottage was so perfect! The location was just right and it was a very quiet neighbourhood. The decor and all the special touches made our stay so comfortable! Thank you!
15775735,199741428,2017-10-02,4153966,Annie,"La Mer cottage was adorable! So cute and clean and directions were so clear and simple. We were there for a wedding so didn't spend a ton of time at the house, but the beds were comfortable (memory foam, yes please!). I'd definitely recommend staying here if you're two couples or a group of 5. :)"
15775735,200237703,2017-10-04,84719087,Bonnie,"I'm so glad I chose La Mer for my anniversary. It was the perfect location with the perfect atmosphere. Thank you, Michael and Amy for your hospitality!"

Easy access to beautiful scenery and good restaurants, as well as a Trader Joe's in the neighborhood and a well-stocked kitchen, made this the perfect choice for our girl trip birthday celebration."
15775735,207771518,2017-10-29,52848322,Jeff,"Great comfy and homey house in an excellent location.  Convenient to Monterey, Carmel and Big Sur. Very clean and well equipped.

Gorgeous beaches and views, wildlife viewing, and of course the Aquarium can't be beat. Loved this location for convenience. The decor of the cottage is inspiring and sweet. So many interesting details. Thank you for putting together such a thoughtful place to stay."

15775735,233710058,2018-02-10,25417434,Glenn,"This is a beautiful old home that is several blocks up from the ocean but easy walking or running distance. Parking was simple on the street. Check-in was a breeze and was even able to get in a bit early. Would highly recommend this place! While a bit pricey, it was still worth it."
15775735,236252574,2018-02-18,9338660,Nelis,Very cute place! Lots of charming decorations in this cozy cottage. Easily walkable to the Aquarium and Lovers Point and restaurants. Everything you need. We had a great time.

Spotlessly clean, super cute kitchen & bathroom, very tasteful decoration. All beds have memory foam mattress toppers & cosy sheets, blankets & comforters. No need for additional contact with Michael & Amy, but all contact we had with them was quick, friendly & helpful."

This is an awesome house at a great location that is walking distance to lots of great shops and restaurants. It's got everything you need and has ample space. Joy is a wonderful host who makes sure to make herself accessible to guests. She responds right away to your questions.

15857785,128121709,2017-01-22,47404069,Marc,Two friends and I stayed at the Cottage while we played golf in Pebble Beach. It was perfect for what we needed. It was walking distance to many restaurants and the Lighthouse Ave area. The living area and beds were both comfortable for the 3 of us.

15857785,138038843,2017-03-18,23701375,Erik,"We are very grateful for the travel cot Joy provided at a moments notice. She also offered us the possibility to check in early which was really appreciated as it made our life much easier with the kids. 
We had a good stay in the house. The location Is simply amazing! 10 minutes from beautiful beaches and centrally located within Pacific Grove.
I would have several recommendations which would have made our stay easier and more comfortable. 
We found the kitchen was equipped with the bare minimum unfortunately. Not enough pots and pans, wood spoons, serving spoons, salad bowls, etc...
The house is old inside and the decoration reflects that. However it is comfortable. 
I just didn't feel that it was quite worth the money we paid for it. 
Joy is a great host but the house needs improving to make the stay worth paying the money requested. The amazing location alone doesn't warrant the price. 
That having been said, we still had a good stay. 
Thanks again Joy."
15857785,139124316,2017-03-23,48256349,Kate,"Wonderful location for walking to many shops, restaurants, movie theater and historic sites. Suggest picking up a map of the Pacific Grove Walking Tour."

15857785,141930042,2017-04-05,25772880,Oliver,Perfect location near downtown Pacific Grove.  Easy drive to the aquarium and close to dining.  Only note for parents is that the curtains don't block out too much light so take note of little ones need darkness to nap.
15857785,142315124,2017-04-07,29482659,Chris,"Great location, we were on a guys trip to Pebble Beach and found the location to be very convenient. A small TV would be handy to finish the nights. Cool house in a great location! "
15857785,142560946,2017-04-08,62796888,Alyson,We had a fantastic stay. Joy and the property owner were incredibly welcoming and kind. The location is perfect for a lovely sea side vacation.

15857785,144107416,2017-04-14,5744774,Lissa,"You can not beat the location of this cottage. My 4-person family spent about a week there and did not get in the car once. We walked to the water 2x per day, coffee and food, grocery store, the aquarium, a museum, farmers market, and parks. The street is quiet but half a block down is a row of victorians converted to restaurants, salons, etc. (the pizza place was outstanding.) the house itself is well-outfitted for guests, refreshingly minimal (uncluttered), but has everything you need in the kitchen, linens, essential supplies like TP, soap, etc. no tv which was fine with us, fast internet. I especially loved that it was spotlessly clean. The only thing we were not expecting is that there is only one bedroom with a door. The other two have curtains. Fine visually, but with small kids it's nice to put them down for bed and know we won't wake them up. The upshot: We would definitely stay there again. "
15857785,145904953,2017-04-20,117034391,Nan,"Joy is a ""Joy"" to work with."
15857785,146750411,2017-04-23,57531398,Jay,Great cozy cottage! The daybed had its own little room so it was like a 3 bedroom rather than the 2 bed plus convertible that I was expecting! Within walking distance of shops and interior was warm at night. 
15857785,147601430,2017-04-27,81151741,Nivritha,Charming cottage! And great location. We stayed only one night and wished we could stay longer.

15857785,150286973,2017-05-07,15059890,Scott,"This house is in a great location and is a good value. I loved being able to walk into Pacific Grove for food, and it's an easy drive to the Aquarium area. The house is a cute cottage. It gives it a very ""beachhouse bungalow"" feel, which is great as you can see the ocean in the distance if you step out the front door. The living room is nice, and the kitchen -- while very basic -- is nice to have. It's a good place to host a small family.

Two somewhat minor complaints keep this from being a solid 5 stars: first, the front bedroom is smaller than you might expect. It's also only separated from the living room by a curtain, which isn't really the privacy I was expecting.  Second, the owner requested that guests clean their own mugs and glasses when used. We did this, but it bothers me both that we pay a cleaning fee that doesn't cover this pretty basic thing and that the cleanliness of the glasses provided is dependent on the thoroughness of previous guests. 

But I don't want to discourage people from renting Joy's place. It was super easy to access, the owner was very nice when he stopped by to retrieve a left scarf, the location is phenomenal. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends. "
15857785,150704912,2017-05-08,59064494,Xin,Great little place for a short trip.
15857785,151990260,2017-05-14,119095200,Walter,"This is a good value for a group of three or more.  Good beds, potentially room to sleep six, easy walk to water, where there are wonderful views.  Reasonable walk to Cannery Row and Monterey Aquarium--along the water if you like.  There's a small but pleasant living room and a good-sized kitchen with a large table that can seat 8 (I think).  Only one bathroom (small stall shower, no bath), but everything works well. We enjoyed it."
15857785,153671997,2017-05-21,5058492,Diane,"Great place to stay while visiting the PG, Monterey areas.  The kitchen had what we needed and small extras like salt,  olive oil and tea which were really nice.  There were plenty of bath towels, tp, dish towels.  Neighborhood is really quiet, the little shopping center is cute and easy going and the market is right next door.  For a family of four on the road for a month, our week at Joy's flew by and we enjoyed every moment."
15857785,154292065,2017-05-23,3711436,Brenda,"Wonderful, cozy house within walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, and Lover's point. "
15857785,155175748,2017-05-27,59959137,Justin,Joy's cottage is perfectly located for a relaxing trip to Pacific Grove. Great hostess with excellent communication and trip suggestions. Great great great!

15857785,158869905,2017-06-08,4713332,Hilaire,We couldn't have asked for a better location! This cute cottage is just doors away from great restaurants and shops. The cottage itself had plenty of space to relax and the sunroom was especially nice!
15857785,160153206,2017-06-12,78794060,Haiyang,Everything was great but there is something you should keep in mind that there is only one bathroom. And the house is a tiny one that can hold up to 5people. One thing embarrassing is that the bathroom has two doors connecting the two bedrooms. So you can get into the bathroom via either bedroom.
15857785,160818593,2017-06-15,77610333,Yvette,Great location! All recommended restaurants and sites to see were excellent. Comfy beds. Decor could be updated a bit. We loved the location very much!
15857785,161082936,2017-06-16,59955602,Andrew,"Perfect location, steps to everything. Beautiful home, would definitely come back and rent again"
15857785,163157053,2017-06-23,4783081,David,The cottage was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 3 small children.  Neighborhood is super walkable with restaurants.

15857785,166163527,2017-07-02,58658174,Nayla,"The place was better than I expected. The house, sheets, and towels were nice and clean. The location is amazing. Check-in and check-out were very easy, as well as getting wifi access. Parking was also quite easy. It was well-stocked with extra blankets and everyday toiletries. 
We arrived at night, so didn't really know what the surrounding area was like. The next morning, I stepped out and saw the ocean just down the street. Pacific Grove is a cute little town, and there are many tourist spots in the area, which are easy to access from this Cottage. I certainly recommend it for anyone visiting this beautiful area. "
15857785,166879815,2017-07-04,63012143,Bin,It's a very nice place!
15857785,167432811,2017-07-06,80681501,Elmarie,Joy's place was ideal for our family to stay in with 3 different rooms with beds.  It was clean and orderly and checking in was super easy and convenient as well as good wi-fi and close to everything.  Joy was very responsive and we have nothing but good memories from our stay there!  Thanks Joy!
15857785,167723896,2017-07-07,129086149,Marisa,Great spot in a a gorgeous beachside area.  Quaint little cottage that was lovely and clean.  No TV was a bonus to enjoy the quiet surroundings.  Would definitely recommend for families 
15857785,168076220,2017-07-08,44965713,Dave,"This house is as described in the write-up.  It is comfortable and clean - was a great alternative to paying for two hotel rooms for our family of five. It is walking distance to lots of shops and is an easy drive from the beauty of Carmel and 17 Mile Drive.

It is not luxurious, nor, it seems, does the host aspire for it to be.  But, if you're looking for a simple, non-pretentious spot from which to base your exploration of the Monterrey Peninsula, this is a good one."
15857785,168599622,2017-07-09,108781331,袆帆,"在蒙特雷海洋馆的边上,很方便也很安静。非常好"
15857785,169238925,2017-07-11,82865627,Wojtek,"The cottage was as advertised: charming, conveniently located and it well suited our party of five (3 adults + 2 kids) for one night.

If you are a group, intend to stay multiple nights and want to store food and prepare meals, note that there is only an under-the-counter fridge and a 24"" stove/oven.

When we stayed, the host confirmed, that new carpet had been recently installed and there was an ""off-gassing"" smell present.  This will dissipate with time and airing.
If you are sensitive, contact the host to check."
15857785,169816971,2017-07-13,47590230,Ben,"We had a great stay at Joy's place.  Fantastic location, close to shops, restaurants, beach, swimming pool and the main drag.  House is comfortable and as described."

15857785,174700975,2017-07-26,129146770,Jana,"Perfect cottage for the 5 of us. Loved Pacfic Grove & its history but beware, the town gets sleepy very early so make dinner plans before everything closes."

It is very pretty and comfortable and the owners are thoughtful in providing lots of little extras. A great place to stay for peace and quiet and to explore the coastline and wildlife. 
15857785,178093612,2017-08-04,42054839,Pete,"Joy's place is really well located, being quiet, yet close to all the  amenities of Pacific Grove. We had two children in tow, so having nearby markets and coffee shops made everything much more convenient. Definitely recommended, and a bonus is that the Aquarium is walkable from the location."
15857785,179548282,2017-08-07,26175166,Lori,We throughly enjoyed Joy's place. It was perfect for our family - located within walking distance to the beach and plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and even a store around the corner. It is super quiet and comfortable. We would go back there again!

Bonne literie. (2 lits 140, 1 lit en 90)
Wifi efficace.
Problème de propreté de la vaisselle et placards dans la cuisine.
Pas de rideaux occultants ni de volets , comme souvent aux USA,même dans les chambres, c'est très désagréable d'etre réveillé des que le soleil se lève. Prendre un masque (comme dans les avions)."

15857785,190732482,2017-09-04,5430298,Tobias,Joy was easy to communicate with. Also since we got there right at the big heat wave she also attended our request to get additional fans to cope with the heat. I would definitely recommend friends and family to stay at this place.

15857785,199339342,2017-10-01,34237516,Adrian,Joy has a wonderful house in a great central location. Pacific Grove is a beautiful scenic town with lots to see. Great host and highly recommended.
15857785,201672097,2017-10-08,15721463,Monica,Joy's place in Pacific Grove is a perfect place to chill out after a beautiful day of relaxing and taking in the sites and local cuisine.  Communication is very important when renting an AirBnB and Joy was always very quick to respond to anything from finding out about the location to suggestions about what to do around town.  The place itself is perfectly placed to be able to enjoy all the local attractions.  And the view from her front street all the way down right to the ocean cannot be beat.  Enjoy future travelers ... this one is a gem!!

15857785,213115625,2017-11-19,1329570,Laura,"We were very happy with Joy's cottage and would stay there again! The cottage is just as listed, with two comfortable bedrooms, and easy check-in/check-out. Pacific Grove is a quiet, picturesque town. If you're touring the area, this is a great home base. One bedroom does not have a door, but rather a curtain, which was totally fine with us! There is some sort of noise that comes from the neighbouring house (a banging, perhaps related to heat/water) and you can hear their TV. I mention only in case there are light sleepers, it may be good to bring a pair of ear plugs. Totally out of the control of the host, so I mention only to help prepare guests."
15857785,213549851,2017-11-21,55573226,Chris,"Great location, 2 doors from Fandango restaurant with an outstanding wine list. A great home with character, location to downtown and all the needs of home. Joy was a pleasure to work with."

15857785,230662444,2018-01-28,57889656,Beryl,"This house is rad. It’s clean, comfy, warm (and for a coastal town in California, that’s not always the case), and it literally is just up the street from one of the most beautiful viewpoints in the Pacific Grove / Monterey Area. Joy is also incredibly communicative, which has been really helpful. 10/10 would book again."
15857785,232425521,2018-02-04,18967145,Dolf,Very convenient location! We'd come back again.

15857785,242695762,2018-03-12,9215337,Carolyn,"Location cannot be beat. Many restaurants, bakery, coffee all within walking distance and away from the touristy areas of Monterrey.  The home is a charming bungalow style home that offers several sleeping areas which is excellent for families with older children.  We loved it."
15857785,243631751,2018-03-16,17305705,Stephanie,Perfect place to stay with or with out kids!. Close cafe and coffee shop. The beach is a straight walk to the beach. The house is nice and clean! The beds were comfortable.
15857785,245548554,2018-03-22,177021577,David,"Charming Pacific Grove cottage, steps from shops and restaurants, banks and the coastal trail. Couldn't be a better location for a Monterey Peninsula getaway. And Joy was super quick to follow up on check out issues. Thank you, Joy!"
15857785,246602329,2018-03-25,130165091,Lisa,"Wonderful little cottage! Very clean and tidy. Easy check in & out. So close to the little shops and restaurants, and a nice walk directly to Lovers Point. Highly recommend!"
15857785,247508178,2018-03-28,61393869,Shannon,"Joy's place is lovely. Our family of five (3 kids) felt very relaxed. The beds were very comfortable, and the the location can not be beat! We had a small issue with ants, but Joy was extremely responsive and it was quickly remedied. So many activities are just down the street – we did whale watching, had dinner with a great view of the beach, and drove 17-mile at sunset. The local ice cream shop was a hoot too! If you're interested in staying near Monterey, Pacific Grove is the place to be, and this place is the perfect location and ambiance."
15857785,248572266,2018-03-31,14983344,Michael,"Joy was a great host. The place is very central in Pacific Grove which is a beautiful town, in a great location on the Monterey Peninsula, although it is a little sleepy. The cottage is beautiful and the nice touches were great but it’s a 2.5 bedroom place really. Thanks for having us!"
15857785,250320608,2018-04-04,35728726,Ken,We loved Joy’s place. It was cozy and clean and felt like a “home away from home.” Comfy beds and close to everything but not in the middle of the touristy areas. Really felt like part of the neighborhood. And what a beautiful neighborhood.
15857785,251928543,2018-04-08,26266845,Valeria,"This place is wonderful, the location is excellent! Perfect for a family. Close to so many restaurants and shops! The host was great, We will definitely come back and stay here again."

15942471,125053623,2017-01-03,25377022,Larry,"My family had a great stay, and the name ""Comfortable Home"" is very appropriate. The home is great with everything inside and out in new or near new condition. We really appreciate being able to show up and find a clean house with everything working, and a bottle of wine.

Thank you again, Lisa!"

15942471,164827945,2017-06-29,7803238,Jackie,The home is newly updated and has beautiful and comfortable furnishings and a great kitchen.  It was very conveniently located near grocery stores and to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row.  I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.  
15942471,166880429,2017-07-04,25516006,Sean,Lisa's place is brand new and has everything we need for our stay. Our family had a great time here!
15942471,169234811,2017-07-11,130252388,Sandy,"Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The home was very clean, nicely and comfortably furnished, and conveniently located for getting around the area. Only a few minor suggestions for future guests. The bathroom sink  faucets excessively sprayed water-beyond the sink basin, the shower ran hot/cold intermittently and we had only 3 wash clothes for 6 occupants. We didn't notify Lisa as these were not showstoppers for our trip.  And These items can be easily addressed.  This property is an excellent value for staying in the area. Highly recommend to others."
15942471,171798974,2017-07-18,139545288,Elizabeth,"The house was great! Immaculately renovated, sparkling clean and very comfortable. Such a great neighborhood and very close to beautiful Monterey Aquarium and Fishermans Wharf. Lisa was great to work with and very responsive. Awesome experience."
15942471,174065531,2017-07-24,58874194,Ryan," Great house in a perfect location if you want to visit many sites and attractions in the area. Would return,  and recommend to others!"
15942471,176789895,2017-07-31,5467650,Darlene,"Our stay at Lisa's place was lovely.  It had a large kitchen, which we enjoyed since we did a lot of baking.  The neighborhood was quiet.  We loved the ease of check in and check out.  It was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  The hot water was a little iffy: some times it would be great in the kitchen but would have to run the showers for quite some time before getting hot.  Other times showers hot immediately and would have to run the kitchen faucet for some time for the water to get hot.  Maybe it was just the shower scheduling for 6 people.  We would definitely stay there again."
15942471,182039572,2017-08-13,142824805,Kelly,Beautiful house! Great location to everything! Perfect for our stats needs! Lisa was quick to get back to me when I had questions!!
15942471,187839887,2017-08-27,140626285,Andie,This place was perfect for our weekend stay with two families with small children. Short drive to the aquarium and cannery row. The only thing we wish we could change was the size of the beds. We hope to be back soon!
15942471,201618886,2017-10-08,17248546,Gaston,Very nice and clean place. Close to everything. Lisa was great!

The house was super clean and welcoming. Even better than the pictures. The location is also great as it's 7 min to Asilomar beach, and 20 minutes to Point Lobos. We had a great time, thanks so much Lisa!"

15942471,244823451,2018-03-19,30128509,Caroline,"Spacious house in convenient, quiet location for our weekend getaway to Monterey. Lisa was responsive and provided everything we needed. The house was comfortable and perfect for toddlers (ie. No stairs, no decorative items for them to break or mess with). Only thing unexpected was that there's no microwave, but we made do with the nice stove and toaster oven. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Lisa!"

It is a 10-15 minute drive to all of the great tourist spots in Monterey. Lawrence was very attentive, responded quickly to my texts, and gave us great recommendations for food in the area. The living room is very cozy with a huge flat screen & Apple TV which came in handy when we needed a break from exploring. In terms of the sleeping situation, the bed is pretty firm more fit for a ninja than myself. Otherwise, we had a wonderful trip and appreciated the hospitality! Thanks!!"

16476278,161304786,2017-06-17,110674066,Celeste,"Sean's house is one of the nicest places we have stayed. The location cannot be beat,  it's so close to Lovers Point beach and the recreation trail. We enjoyed watching the sunsets each evening and looking for deer around town. The aquarium,  Point Lobos and Carmel are just a short drive. The house is well equipped, we were able to pick up food from Trader Joe's and have a few meals in. Everything was very clean and new, beds are very comfortable. "

16476278,168965563,2017-07-10,12814120,Brittany,"What a lovely place. Clean, quiet and very well appointed with everything you might need to feel at home. A family of 4 adults felt comfortable in the space. There is a view to the water, and the cannery shops are only about a thirty minute walk away. We enjoyed doing 17-mile drive to Carmel, which is under 5 minutes down the road. I would gladly return. "
16476278,174094035,2017-07-24,33471144,Sandy,"The location is so central and perfect for a visit to the Monterey area. The beds are comfy, everything you need is there and the host was very available if we had questions. It's actually the best Airbnb I have stayed in! Book it if you can!"
16476278,179574804,2017-08-07,131662710,Martin,"Great location just off the coast road, and with easy access to Monterey and Carmel. Lovely fun modern quirky house with great views from first floor"
16476278,234430637,2018-02-12,25996830,Jim,"Sean’s place was just as described. The moment you step foot into the place you feel like your at home. The view from the second floor had a breathtaking view of the water. I was visiting to celebrate my brother’s 50th birthday. Sean recommended a local bakery where I was able to order a cake. Communication was great, place was super clean, and amenities such as aquarium passes came in handy. This was my first time visiting Monterey but I plan on visiting again in the future. I just hope that Sean’s place is available. Would stay here again."
16476278,236910398,2018-02-20,81988631,Jeanine,We really enjoyed staying at the mermaid cottage. The home is very clean and comfortable. Just a short walk to the beach. Great view from upstairs. Loved opening the window and listening to the ocean and seagulls. Very relaxing!
16476278,250609434,2018-04-05,47743902,Steve,Pacific Grove gives you proximity to both Monterey and Carmel without the traffic of either  with easy access to them.  Easy beach access and trails right across the street.  Quiet.

It has a fantastic ocean view from nearly every room, located just steps from the beach with a spacious backyard patio and garden, as well.  It's a short drive from the aquarium and restaurants. A great value for family travel. We would stay again. "
16884158,149345144,2017-05-03,42235992,Sharon,Great communication with Evelyn and the place is amazing!!! Waking up to the waves and parting with beautiful sunsets;)
16884158,151659914,2017-05-13,117934830,Lynn,"Although not horrible, there was a bit more traffic than I expected at night and the neighbors sensor light came on almost every time a car drove by. Lots of windows and natural light, however if you are sensitive to light while sleeping it may be a problem. Other than that, the house is in a fabulous location, the backyard is roomy and relaxing, and the home feels cozy. "
16884158,154230054,2017-05-23,12483904,Teresa,"This place is awesome, a beautiful view and easy to access all amenities. "
16884158,154948947,2017-05-26,43611371,Nathan,"What a great place!  The pictures of the house really do not do it justice; everything is clean and nicely decorated.  It's literally right across the street from the beach.  The neighborhood is quiet, it's not too touristy, great food and fun within a few minutes, etc.  We will definitely stay here again the next time we go to Pacific Grove or Monterey."
16884158,171098837,2017-07-16,3763841,Diana,"This place is central to everything and absolutely beautiful!! Gorgeous views of the ocean when waking and at sunset, it was not crowded at all, easy to get to. Got an early check-in and later check-out time.  Everything is well stocked and there is even beach stuffs in the garage for use.  Evelyn was absolutely prompt at getting back and so kind when we thought we lost a key!  The 2 free aquarium passes were wonderful to use too. <3 would definitely stay again"

16884158,186142041,2017-08-23,29337633,Emily,"Beautiful home, the rooms had plenty of storage, and the kitchen was well equipped for us to make dinner each evening.  We loved the location, it was close to the beaches, the aquarium and it was so easy for us to get around. No problems with parking, great instructions on how to use everything in the home."
16884158,195531246,2017-09-19,67775554,Damien,"Great location with some killer views of the ocean - really relaxing. The home had everything we needed and we made some great meals in the fully stocked kitchen. If you have a car Monterey is really close, otherwise it's a one hour stroll.  We'll definitely be back."
16884158,199391890,2017-10-01,13865451,Diann,"The location and view just don’t get any better. Walk across the street and you’re at beautiful tide pools, or meander along the path that runs next to the ocean for miles. The house is clean and very sweet and we enjoyed our coffee each morning while watching the waves crash on the rocks."
16884158,204375697,2017-10-17,38142966,Patrick,"Très jolie maison avec tout le confort nécessaire et une vue sur l'océan extraordinaire . Très bien équipée et très bien entretenue.

Très belle région à visiter - à ne pas manquer !"
16884158,204999467,2017-10-20,518274,Chantal,"Amazing location, spent our mornings sat looking out to sea. Spotlessly clean, there were some snacks and sparkling water left for us on arrival - very thoughtful. We really appreciated the Aquarium membership cards, saved us a lot of money - a visit is a must!  Evelyn was very hospitable and answered all our questions quickly.  Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"
16884158,207767681,2017-10-29,25626372,Colleen,"A beautiful home with fantastic views of the ocean waves and shoreline flora and fauna. The house is clean, bright and peaceful and well equipped for lovely meals! A wonderful place from which to take an ocean walk and enjoy the views and clean air. An all around enjoyable place to stay! Highly recommend."
16884158,211663121,2017-11-13,49358770,Craig,Evelyn's place was PERFECT. The location is absolutely outstanding. We almost didn't want to get out and explore and instead just sit on the front porch and watch the waves. Evelyn was great to work with and I highly recommend her wonderful home!
16884158,214394754,2017-11-25,7450560,Viv,"Evelyn's home is a special place.  Not only is it right across the street from the ocean,  but there is a beautiful backyard where you can enjoy the sunshine to the sounds and smell of the ocean.   This home is perfect for families.  There is no shortage of bath towels or kitchen supplies.  Thanks, Evelyn, for a wonderful stay!"
16884158,215288390,2017-11-28,22410072,Katy,What a great space!  Location was amazing.  You couldn't beat the view!  We really enjoyed our stay and if/when we make it back to Pacific Grove we would definitely stay again!
16884158,216794947,2017-12-05,155834545,Kathy,"We love love loved staying at Ocean Front on Ocean View Blvd for our 3-day family getaway!!!  We watched sea otters every morning from our front window sipping coffee with breakfast.  Late afternoon, we explored tide pools across the street.  The guys played a round of golf at the golf course 2-3 block away and we spent one day at the Aquarium.  There was also an evening walk around the neighborhood.  So convenient and fun!

The kitchen is well-stocked with basic spices, pots/pans, serving dishes, two coffee makers (drip and Keriug) small appliances, Brita pitcher, ice maker, a very nice gas stove/oven, microwave, plenty of good dinnerware, knives, etc.  With one trip to nearby Safeway, we made all meals except lunch when we went to the Aquarium.  There were games, puzzles, movies, binoculars, and Aquarium passes (2).  In the garage there were sand toys, beach totes with towels, lanterns, kids table/chairs and a separate laundry room.  Our 2 yo granddaughter was delighted to find bins of toys and books.

The first bedroom has a king size bed and a TV in the closet.  The second bedroom has two twin beds.  The back bedroom has a queen and a half bathroom with toilet and sink.  Each bedroom has cozy warm bathrobes for guest use.  Warm blankets, comforters and plenty of pillows in each bedroom.  Also on the couch and chairs in the living room.

We were 5 adults, a toddler and an infant.  We never felt crowded in the house.  There is a large backyard with a gas grill and a fountain that you can turn on.  The front view really is the very best!  We kept the front blinds open when we were home during the day.  The waves could be heard crashing from the front bedroom during the night - so cool!!

A nice welcome basket was in the kitchen with a few snacks and sparkling water.  We went early in December and Christmas decorations were throughout the house.  WiFi was available along with a printer, if needed.  Great host with easy clear instructions.   The house binder is thorough and easy to follow.  No shoes allowed in the house - gotta keep all that sand outside where it belongs!  I took pictures of every room when we first arrived so we could make sure everything was back in its original place when we left. 
 All used towels were washed and in the dryer as we left for home.  Thank you Evelyn and her support crew!  We would love to return and hopefully spend more time at this wonderful home!"
16884158,219520769,2017-12-17,13875035,Steven,"We absolutely loved this place!  This is the perfect beach house in that it had a gorgeous view of Monterey Bay, roomy, cozy and comfortable.  Beautiful touches throughout the house - from the kitchen, decor, colors, bedrooms and the living room/dining room where you can watch the ocean view all day!
The house was fully equipped for most everything you need.  Would definitely stay here again!"
16884158,220973220,2017-12-24,67518763,Kelly,“The Blue House at John Denver Point” as we now call it was awesome. Very comfortable with all the touches of home. We will definitely be back soon and often!
16884158,226849613,2018-01-12,105582709,John,"Great location, wonderful views and excellent communication with the property owner.  "
16884158,231353732,2018-01-31,16064415,Ben,"This was the perfect getaway for our family.  My four year old son enjoyed having his own room, and the 3 month old slept amazingly well (thank god!) which meant we slept amazingly well.  The view from the front window made feeding the baby enjoyable and the fireplace at night was a great way to relax with a glass of wine.  The house was very nicely decorated, with plenty of personal touches that made us feel right at home.   The informational packet provided gave us everything we needed, so we did not have to reach out to the host's contacts at any point, but it was made clear they were ready to help if we ever needed anything.  

Having the trial right across from the house was great for morning walks & runs, but without having to deal with people parking and blocking the view.   It did require a five minute drive to get to the aquarium or dinner, but that also meant fewer people around.  

Our only regret is we did not stay longer, we were still discovering toys in the house and areas to explore in the neighborhood when we left.  I would absolutely recommend this house for a family vacation.  "
16884158,247789091,2018-03-29,19450984,Jonas,Thanks so much. A great little place!

There are restaurants and stores nearby, nothing was more than 3 minutes away.  My kids were thrilled to see a family of deer that lives in the neighborhood.   Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium was the highlight of our stay, along with a day trip up to San Francisco.

M&M's cottage was very nice with a pretty garden.    Michelle met us when we arrived and gave us a quick tour.

16932154,200006343,2017-10-03,55991043,Nancy,"The location is perfect for Pacific Grove. Close to beaches, downtown and Cannery Row. Nice fenced in front yard, great for little ones. Nice size kitchen and well stocked. Washer and dryer a plus. Beds comfortable with warm down comforters. Nice towels and plenty of them. Michelle was a great host and responded to texts quickly. She welcomed us with some nice treats. Would definitely stay there again."

16932154,207696381,2017-10-29,155831474,Stephanie,"Lovely! What a great little find in Pacific Grove, one of my all-time-favorite towns in Northern California. The location was great, so close to Lighthouse and lots of shops and restaurants and the water! The house was super clean and neat and tidy, perfect for myself, my husband-to-be and in-laws. I would absolutely love to go back, and will tell friends."
16932154,211440438,2017-11-12,19248303,Clark,"Michelle's place is very comfortable and quiet. Two beautiful quiet rooms and a nice sitting porch. Nice walk to the beach and shops. We made dinner in the kitchen, fully equipped. We'd stay again!"
16932154,222426293,2017-12-29,37355182,Peter,"Fantastic place in a quiet area, convenient for the main area of Pacific Grove. We loved walking through the quiet beautiful neighborhood to the main restaurant area of Pacific Grove, visiting the very close-by Asilomar SB and the comfortable and spacious living quarters. The kitchen is very completely outfitted and suitable for families etc wanting to cook meals here. Lovely house we'd enjoy visiting again."
16932154,236653963,2018-02-19,62505099,Anne,"The cottage is very well located (short walk to a few stores and the beach) on a quiet enough street. The little garden is great for letting the kids run around whilst we were getting meals ready. The cottage was spacious for the 4 of us with a well equipped kitchen. The boiler can get noisy in the evening and with no doors closing, it is difficult to escape it. Michelle was really helpful and accommodating before and during the stay."
16999624,147013222,2017-04-24,66084084,Todd,Sea House is amazing!  Another couple and I surprised my wife with a weekend getaway and it couldn't have been better.  The harbor seals were having pups on the beach right across the street which is a marine life sanctuary.  Cannery Row and the Aquarium are a short few blocks walk. The house itself was great for two couples and didn't feel cramped at all.  It would also work great for a family.  There is a nice cozy back porch where we sat and chatted in the evening.  I could recommend Sea House any more for the ultimate Monterey getaway!
16999624,153806170,2017-05-21,72594363,Teresa,This house is perfect! Feels spacious and is in a great location. Literally five minute walk to Monterey Bay Aquarium and directly across the street from the bay/ocean. April/May is seal pup season and we were able to see so many baby seals. There is a trail perfect for a morning jog right on the ocean too. The kitchen had everything I needed and plenty of extra towels and even washer liquid. These little things make a big difference. We would love to visit again and enjoy the ocean view from the living room. 
16999624,156249404,2017-05-29,1349304,Cameron,"Book. This. House. We just had the greatest weekend with 3 adults and 2 kids in this home. The layout is great, rooms are spacious, and pictures don't do it justice by far. The home is separated from a seal sanctuary by one quiet two lane road, and the people/seal/otter/whale watching we were able to do from the living room was mind blowing! The aquarium and all of cannery row are less than a 5 minute walk down the seaside bike path. Everything you could want or need is within walking distance. We cannot wait to return. "
16999624,161901325,2017-06-18,79315508,Pia,"The Sea House is great--super close to everything from the aquarium to lovers point. Best yet, there are beautiful views of the seals on the sand from inside the cozy house. Will be returning! "
16999624,168065262,2017-07-08,115958795,Leslie,The Sea House was beautiful. The ocean view from the front window was amazing. Was able to see the harbor seals and sea otters. Perfect location.

16999624,195298145,2017-09-18,97673283,Amy,"The location of this house is ideal.  Just two blocks from Cannery Row and the Aquarium.  The view from the front window provides endless entertainment and the walking path is directly across the road. The house is clean and well organized.  My only negative, which may be someone's else's positive, is that the beds were extremely hard."
16999624,197767333,2017-09-26,69016939,Siddharth,"Fantastic house. Can't get a better location than Dean's house, with amazing views of the shoreline and the ocean, with seals spending their morning relaxing on the beach right in front of the house. What a sight to wake up to every morning.  The house itself was impeccably maintained with beautiful interiors and extremely clean. The house is also walking distance to plenty of restaurants and cafes and only a couple of mins walk from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. If you are looking to visit Monterey/Pacific Grove it's going to be hard to find a better house than this one."
16999624,202074832,2017-10-09,133781881,Andrew,"I stayed at Dean’s place with  my wife and two daughters There was plenty of room for all four of us. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a nice size kitchen!  Within walking distance to lovers point and cannery row.  Views of the ocean were outstanding from the living room and the bedroom.  We saw seals every morning at least 20-30 along the beach.  Amazing place!"
16999624,204171836,2017-10-16,1118156,Mark,Dean's place is perfect for two couples to enjoy Monterey and the coast.  It's right on the water and a short walk in to Cannery Row bars and restaurants.  The house is spacious and clean and Dean is extremely easy to work with.  Enjoy.
16999624,205278112,2017-10-21,26813504,Jennifer,"I rented Dean’s Sea House to celebrate my Mom’s 70th birthday.  It was perfect for our purpose - comfortable, terrific location with a gorgeous view of the bay which is right across the street (harbor seals and sea otters!), close to restaurants and a supermarket. I really couldn’t ask for more."
16999624,214390714,2017-11-25,144987605,Barbara,Beautiful home in great location.

16999624,237369085,2018-02-22,125696817,Meg,"Wonderful location!  Very quick walk to cannery row, restaurants and shops.  Amazing picture window in the family room where you can watch seals and otters all day long. Having the walking path directly across the street was fabulous for walking to Lovers Point or down to cannery row.  
Dean was so responsive in answering any questions we had and welcomed us with a nice card, bottle of wine and chocolates. 
We recommend this house and hope to visit again. 
Sincerely,
Meg and John"
16999624,248133317,2018-03-30,177256059,Susan,"Dean is a very prompt and courteous host. His place was just as the pictures described, very clean, comfortable and inviting.  The location was perfect, a short walk to all the attractions along cannery row, a wonderful pathway around the bay that stretches for miles right outside your door, and of course, the view out the front window was amazing. Watching the harbor seals every day across the street was a blast for the whole family. We would definitely stay here again."
16999624,254091204,2018-04-15,2410650,Anusha,"SeaHouse is a great vacation home with spectacular views. The photos don't do justice to the views. We spent a lot of time in front of the picture window watching the waves and seals. 
The proximity to Cannery Row (Monterey Bay Aquarium) was also awesome, we walked around quite a bit.
Dean was very quick, responsive and supportive when we had an issue (which was our fault)."

17160049,133180359,2017-02-20,36981790,Myra,"Alka’s PG home was perfect for our weekend getaway. We had five adults staying in the home and there was plenty of room for us all to feel comfortable. We checked in a little early and Alka was so flexible and accommodating. The home was equipped with everything we needed – shampoo, conditioner, body wash, extra towels, extra bedding and blankets – and was such a short walk to shopping and restaurants. Alka provides some great recommendations if you’re not too familiar with the area. Between Alka’s responsiveness and hospitality and everything this cute home has to offer, we would definitely stay here again. Thanks again, Alka!"

We traveled with our almost three year old and 7 month old and found the house and the location to be absolutely perfect. We walked everywhere (great restaurants right around the corner as well as a wonderful playground!) and the aquarium passes were an added bonus- we went both days we were there! My toddler cried for ""his beach cottage"" when we left and asked today when we could go back. Thanks, Alka!"

17160049,139893762,2017-03-26,16311289,Steven,"Alka's home in Pacific Grove was perfect for our stay in town for a wedding.  It's walking distance to many cute shops and restaurants, as well as a short drive into Monterey.  We booked Alka's home partially based on the Aquarium tickets that we knew our son would love.  

When we arrived we discovered that the previous renter has accidentally taken the tickets home with them, and Alka was nice enough to meet us both days at the Aquarium front desk to get us into the Aquarium.  Alka clearly takes great care of the property and is extremely responsive as a host.  We would definitely stay again when we visit the area next!"

I have stayed in the center of Monterey previously and I was definitely missing out, from now on it will be Pacific Grove and Alka's place! "

Everything you could possibly need is provided and there was plenty of space for the four of us.
It is truly delightful and unique and I only wish we could have stayed longer!

It is really pretty, beautifully furnished, and a perfect location, being just around the corner from some great places to eat. Don't miss the Bookstore cafe for breakfast or coffee, and Passionfish was just fabulous. It is really easy to get to Monterey and the aquarium and beaches too. The aquarium passes were really useful as it is quite expensive to get in. 
We would highly recommend this lovely cottage and Alka was friendly and easy to contact."
17160049,180217626,2017-08-09,34173113,Vegard,"We really enjoyed our time at Alka's place. It is exactly as described, great location, nice rooms and comfy beds. Would definetly come back!"
17160049,180884983,2017-08-11,63314478,Chiara,"It has been a positive experience, the house is close to all main areas, cozy and pretty furnitures, quiet at night. 
There is only one complain: the house was overall clean, but it could have been cleaned better. For instance I suggest a deeper cleaning of the drawers in the kitchen and sometimes to clean carpets as well.
We never met the owners so I can't tell about them. "
17160049,184909692,2017-08-20,69963665,Kena,"This has got to be my favorite place I have ever stayed in at Pacific Grove. Perfect location, close to everything. Very clean. Alka is a  wonderful host. Communication was easy  and she gets right back with you if any questions or concerns. Would definitely stay again!"
17160049,186431879,2017-08-24,115639785,Tanneke,"Great house, especially with kids. And Good distance to visite yosimite."
17160049,187891419,2017-08-27,34124761,Pandora,"We loved this place. A perfect airbnb rental. 
Alka's home was put together with style & care. It is a good size & well equipped. Very clean & tidy. I loved the supply of green tea too - nice surprise. 
Location is great too. Very close walk to great restaurants & beach. Alka's recommendations were great too. 
We wished we stayed longer as lots more we wanted to do in the area. 
Highly recommend."
17160049,188808031,2017-08-30,68600198,Amy,"Alka's place is a lovely little cottage and a great base from which to explore Pacific Grove, Monterey and Carmel. There are great bakeries nearby as well as a playground. We took our four year old to the aquarium- it was wonderfully empty on a weekday!"
17160049,190671623,2017-09-04,29459457,Connie,My family and I had a great time visiting Pacific Grove and Alka's place was the perfect location and space to rest and regroup. The house is nicely decorated with pops of color and comfortable furniture. Alka maintained great communication throughout our time there which made our visit smooth and worry free. The house is centrally located which is another plus. I would definitely look to stay here again in the future.
17160049,193236817,2017-09-12,37489579,Peter,"Pacific Grove is a beautiful place, and this home is in the heart of it. The location is fabulous!  A short walk to cafes, bakeries, groceries and the beach. You cannot overstate how convenient it is.

The cottage is  wonderfully restored - a lot of amenities like in our recent renovation in our home! The beds were comfy and led to a good night's sleep.  It has everything you need for a relaxing stay.

We did biking, kayaking, lots of walks, and visits to Point Lobos, the Lighthouse - and a free visit to the Aquarium, thanks to the passes."
17160049,198812996,2017-09-30,144129993,Alice HJ,Very quiet and clean. Beautiful backyard and nice neighborhood. Restaurant recommendations were very helpful. Well organized. Highly recommended for family.
17160049,199697306,2017-10-02,585441,Nicolas,"We had a wonderful stay at Alka's beautiful place in Pacific Grove.

The communications with Alka prior to check in was outstanding: a lot of great recommendations and a very clear process for check-in.

The house is lovely and really well and tastefully furnished. The location is terrific, in the heart of Pacific Grove with outstanding restaurants all around.

Our 16-month old son accidentally broke a dish, and the resolution was also very smoothly handled.

Highly recommended!"
17160049,202072244,2017-10-09,3286624,Fiona,"I have no hesitation in recommending Alka’s home. It is a beautiful, stylish home with a fully equipped kitchen, fluffy towels, comfortable beds, spacious lounge areas and extremely well located. We always found street parking easy, although its location meant we could do a lot by foot. As a young family with a 3 year old and baby, we particularly appreciated the walking distance to a local playground, fresh grocer and tickets to the Monterey Aquarium (which took about 20mins walk but glad we did it as the parking there looked rather busy!). Alka was super responsive which made communication a breeze. The self check-in with the master lock was efficient and easy too. There is nothing to fault with this property and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Tip: the local cafes/restaurants recommended were actually very busy so we had to make a reservation in advance to eat there (not just drop in). Ps. we couldn’t find the chopping board but lived without it - besides this, it was very well equipped, even with sandwich bags, cling wrap etc."
17160049,203209463,2017-10-14,7099382,Susie,"Spacious, clean and light - a lovely quiet house to stay.  Fabulous location. Seamless process. Thanks Alka!"
17160049,204168944,2017-10-16,8585315,Leah,"The cottage was very quaint and comfortable. It was within walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, and not to far from several grocery stores. The Monterey Bay Aquarium, beaches, Carmel wineries, and other attractions were only a short drive from the cottage. The only thing that we would have liked a bit more of were cooking supplies. Although, our host came to the rescue and brought us several pots to use! Alka was very accommodating and quick to reply to any texts. Great stay overall."
17160049,205780992,2017-10-22,10764915,Eric,Great location and a beautiful house. Communication was always very quick and friendly. The four of us had plenty of room and enjoyed our stay in the quiet neighborhood.

We enjoyed being able to walk to dinner every night and the coffee shop around the corner was a delight!  We were pleasantly surprised how comfortable and conveniently located this adorable little cottage was--I would highly recommend this property."
17160049,218581907,2017-12-13,19544360,Dena,Wonderful quaint PG home in an excellent location. Easy walk to downtown and local parks and beaches. Having the aquarium passes was an added plus. Great stay.

Pacific Grove is such a cute little town and the house was super close to many restaurants as well as a quick walk to the beach. The Aquarium passes were great too. Would stay here again
17160049,225884947,2018-01-07,65363430,Jennifer,"You cannot get a more wonderful, private, conscientious space for the money. From the moment we arrived we knew the amenities, the lucky location and the easy to follow rules. Dining, grocery, fun, friends, fish and beaches are literally minutes away. It’s a walking friendly location with no shortage of ease and charm. We will absolutely stay with these amazing hosts again when we come this way!!"
17160049,228235670,2018-01-18,127325384,Ted,"Great location!   Half block walk to downtown Pacific Grove and excellent food.  Alka was a great host.  House was clean, well stocked, and comfortable.
Really enjoyed our trip!!"
17160049,230248439,2018-01-27,9171313,Jean-MArtin,"The house is well situated, in a quiet neighborhood. It is clean, bright, cute and the beds are very comfortable. The place is a little bit smaller than it appears on the pictures, but for a family of 4 or 5 it is just perfect. Alka was lovely, and the process for the key was simple and efficient. I would recommend this airbnb to my friend and family without a doubt. Enjoy Pacific Grove!"
17160049,231977876,2018-02-03,10482401,Edd,"Lovely cottage in the beautiful town of Monterey. Really comfortable beds, and stylish furnishings. Would stay again!"
17160049,232653653,2018-02-05,5237762,Emily,"The cottage was perfect for us (2 adults + 1 toddler). The bed was extremely comfortable and we were within walking distance of great restaurants, a playground, and Lover's Point. We were also a short drive from the Aquarium and even more restaurants. Parking was extremely easy."

17160049,236631323,2018-02-19,17762409,Christopher,Wonderful location within walking distance to the water and a number of very cute restaurants and shops. You have easy access to Big Sur! The house is very cute and the beds are comfortable.
17160049,237123896,2018-02-21,71519303,Steve,Alka and Brad are great hosts!  Very quick to respond with tips on where to go and what to eat.  The cottage is located in a very convenient location in Pacific grove.  We loved it!  Super cozy for my family and we look forward to a longer stay next time.
17160049,238486082,2018-02-25,32154176,Emily,"Great location, but lacking some basic amenities that then made the price seem high. The aquarium passes were a nice bonus though!"
17160049,241338024,2018-03-08,96170073,Tina,Alka’s place was close to great places to dine and convenient to the beaches and the aquarium in Monterey. A very gracious host and we loved all her restaurant recommendations.  A super stylish place to boot! Can’t wait to come back soon.
17160049,241880609,2018-03-10,113577740,Karissa,What a great place to stay! We loved staying at Alka's place...she was wonderful at communicating and giving tips.

17160049,245107212,2018-03-20,42535797,Colin,Loved our stay - great location in Pacific Grove - close to everything including some fantastic restaurants.
17160049,247505564,2018-03-28,245993,Jennifer,"A beautiful little cottage in an amazing location. Walking distance to all of the amenities in Pacific Grove and just a short, ocean-side walk to the Monterrey Aquarium. Perfect location to explore Carmel as well!"
17160049,249746901,2018-04-02,30402712,Christoph,Das Haus ist in einer super Lage in einer ruhigen Gegend. In wenigen Schritten ist man in der Hauptstrasse von Pacific Grove mit Restaurants und Geschäften. Ein paar Schritte weiter wartet schon der Lovers Point und die atemberaubende Küste der Monterey Bay.
17160049,250966608,2018-04-06,173855882,Bilal,Good location. Would recommend for thorough cleaning of this place especially toilet/shower and floors.
17160049,251859685,2018-04-08,11334258,Audrey,Alka's home is the epitome of cozy and homey ! We felt so comfortable during our stay. The location could not be better. A quick stroll to Lovers Beach and all of the sites of Monterey and Pacific Grove. We would not hesitate to return.
17160049,252691048,2018-04-11,29645132,Laure,"We had a great time at Alka's place, a very cozy home close to good restaurants and shops, yet very quiet street. Great location to explore all that Monterey and PG have to offer, we wished we had stayed an extra day... Thanks again to our hosts for the quick response to our queries, the free aquarium passes and all the tips about things to do in the area!"
17417237,134915083,2017-03-01,20131382,Allister,The host canceled this reservation 164 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17417237,143434530,2017-04-11,68463018,Xuan,"Rhonda was extremely warm, helpful and easy to reach during our stay. 7th Heaven got a perfect floor plan for a family with kid with the two connected yet individual bedroom (only issue about it is the doors won't lock between the two rooms) and an attic space for parents to relax after kids are down for the night. Also you can see the ocean from the balcony!"
17417237,145539993,2017-04-18,14894330,Sophie,"This place is great! The house itself is cozy and spacious at the same time. Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and well equipped, and all the linens and towels were great. The kitchen has all you need. The location is good - it's a few steps from the beach where you can watch the seals and a 10 - 15 minute walk to the shops, restaurants and aquarium of Monterey. Pacific Grove facilities are a bit closer - lots of good places to eat. Our host, Rhonda, couldn't have been more helpful. When the washing machine stopped working she called by on Easter day to fix it, then stopped by later on to check on it and put the clothes in the dryer - we came back to clean, dry clothes! Our kids loved having the extra space of the room upstairs and the garden is cute too. Would definitely stay here again!"
17417237,146736930,2017-04-23,5792901,Nick,This is great house in an excellent location to explore the area. Lovely decor and very well equiped. Rhonda is a great host and very helpful.
17417237,152498507,2017-05-16,78172913,Christina,"We have been to Monterey several times and have always used a rental to stay. I still can't believe your proximity to everything! Loved the house & we did end up renting bikes from adventures by the sea for the whole weekend(they gave us a great price) from your recommendation. 
Your nightly rate was insanely reasonable compared to the size of your home, the loveliness of it, and how close it was to the ocean and all the goods of Monterey. Our bike ride literally took five minutes to reach Cannery. 

Lindsay was very helpful with some quick responses via text on some basic questions we had(like working the fireplace!) 
Thanks for having us! We will definitely be back. "
17417237,156220996,2017-05-29,9535776,Terry,"My wife and I + a couple of friends had an excellent stay! The beds were super comfortable and the location couldn't be better. A block away from the ocean and walking distance from the aquarium (which you should definitely check out). A+, would recommend. "
17417237,161878479,2017-06-18,29858106,Amanda,"Wonderful little bungalow, so close to the water! Even more spacious than the pictures give it credit for! Stayed for a wedding at Pebble Beach, easy drive away but close to groceries and CVS for weekend supplies. Also very close to the aquarium and cannery row! "
17417237,166544371,2017-07-03,40437426,Kathleen,"Comfortable home and great location on Lover's Point. And bonus, a deer that bedded down in the yard for the night."
17417237,173693717,2017-07-23,104205787,Declan,"We had a lovely stay here! It was the perfect place for our family of 4 including 2 teens. The house is lovely and very, very comfortable. The location is perfect with only a short walk to shops, restaurants, beaches, attractions etc in both Pacific Grove and Cannery Row. We were very sad to leave after our 4 night stay. "
17417237,176369372,2017-07-30,98262837,Jonathan,Close to Monterey
17417237,180978881,2017-08-11,86277417,Cara,"This is a beautiful home in a wonderful location in Pacific Grove-the house was clean, comfortable for two adults and two teens, and within walking distance of all."

This beach cottage was charming and close (walking distance) to everything in Monterey.  We'll definitely stay at one of Rhonda's properties in the future.   Thx...
17417237,199704986,2017-10-02,23463933,Kristy,"The house was clean and nice with comfy furniture. It was in a GREAT location! Very close to the water! The only issue we had was that we had asked for a pack-n-play for our infant daughter which wasn't there when we had arrived. We had to wait several hours and stay up longer than we were hoping on our first night, but Rhonda did bring it that same night. Good house for two couples. Overall good experience!"
17417237,205280575,2017-10-21,114862756,Mary,Lovely house! Walk to the beach and the town! All 5 star setting and place to stay thanks!

17417237,222403014,2017-12-29,88048457,Lauren,"The 7th Heaven host is a quintessential Pacific Grove/Monterey getaway! The house is two blocks from the ocean, where there's a perfect walking trail (we spotted otters and seals during our walks!). It is also a central location to both downtown Pacific Grove and Cannery Row.
The house itself is charming and gets beautiful morning light. The four of us fit comfortably in the two bedrooms and the additional loft space. Would definitely recommend and return!"
17417237,223727778,2018-01-01,40165179,Beatrice,"It’s a super convenient location.  You are only one block from the beach, and about 15 min walk from downtown Monterey, and 2min from Pacific Grove downtown.  It’s well maintained and clean.  The kitchen is well stocked. The bathrooms are a little cumbersome but the washer, dryer, and a large refrigerator made our stay very convenient.  Rhonda is super friendly and made us feel welcomed.  I would definitely stay here again."
17417237,227669117,2018-01-15,64702471,Steven,"Location was perfect, only 1.5 blocks to the bay and a beautiful walking/biking trail. Easy walk to the aquarium. Plenty of street parking. We used the nice bar-b-que in the backyard. The beds were very very comfortable. Four adults had plenty of room. As a tip, bring your own spices and condiments including salt and pepper as there were none. We would stay here again."
17417237,229051719,2018-01-21,51190619,Seven,The house is in good position and can run by the sea in the morning. The bed is very comfortable and has a good sleep. The service is very considerate. The room is well equipped.
17417237,234462676,2018-02-12,120465896,Sue,I liked the kitchen and the whole house was roomy! Most of all we liked the location and convenience.
17417237,238391975,2018-02-25,26738274,Chaat,"Lovely spot and fairly well appointed. If you want a morning coffee, however, bring your own grind in case inventory is low. Great lighting. It’s a great location and comfortable home base for checking out Pacific Grove, MBA, and Monterey. We would totally love to come back!! Oh, and host Rhonda is super nice and responsive to questions and coordination!!"
17417237,240392686,2018-03-04,38715986,Drew,Outstanding experience and Rhonda was an amazing communicator.  Super charming home with wonderful little touches.  We loved the stove!!!  And the view down to the water is great.  Very central with easy parking.  Would love to stay again.

17435310,200256077,2017-10-04,64349634,Annette,We loved staying at Fatijah's house. It is a lovely big house containing everything we needed for our stay. It suited our two extended families very well with it's flexible living rooms and bedrooms. The central kitchen/living room was a wonderful meeting area for all of us. This is a beautiful part of California with an abundance of sea and wild life and plenty of activities to suit everyone.  Fatijah was excellent to deal with and I would definitely recommend staying here.
17435310,203823280,2017-10-15,10554113,Charles I.,"Fatijah was very responsive and helpful.  Home was well kept, stocked with essentials and nicely furnished. The 8 golfers in our group ages 26-65 felt right at home.  Highly recommended.   Charles"

It was very clean and we were welcomed by a cute welcome note as well as guest passes for the aquarium. This was a wonderful perk, as admission to the aquarium for two adults is $100. The bed was soft and cozy and the place was well appointed with pillows, towels, soap etc. The kitchen was graciously well stocked with anything you might need to make a full meal! I wish we had been able to travel with our pup, as there were welcoming supplies for a dog! The yard was beautiful and we appreciated the motion sensor light on the back garage as we pulled in late. Joe's instructions to check in were great and joe and Kathy offered welcome suggestions on the area. "
17479137,141945613,2017-04-05,996403,Jonathan,Joe and Kathy were super communicative and answered all our queries promptly. The place was just as described and the three of us each got our own bedroom. Ten minutes walk to a great bookstore/cafe!
17479137,142952134,2017-04-09,75058473,Meredith,"This house is exactly as advertised!  Decent location, walking distance to bakery and restaurants. Kitchen is extra nice!"
17479137,145529366,2017-04-18,118889112,Lisa,Good location and charming updated older home.
17479137,146768927,2017-04-23,60045913,Jonathan,"Home was pleasant, well appointed and had everything we needed for a great Monterey stay. Would certainly come back again "
17479137,147811810,2017-04-28,11101000,Sue,"We enjoyed our stay and would recommend Joe's place to anyone traveling to Monterey.  

We took advantage of the aquarium tickets and the aquarium was great. I would strongly recommend the Monterey Fish Company (Pier 2) and the Sea Harvest Fish Market for those who enjoy seafood.  The Paris bakery was very good as well. 

Beds were comfortable. Hosts were very responsive. Kitchen was well equipped.  "
17479137,148885194,2017-05-01,7730762,Samantha,"We had a great stay here. Beautiful house, great location. Perfect for a weekend trip. Joe was really helpful coordinating our trip and providing local recommendations."
17479137,154936977,2017-05-26,127256363,Courtney,"Great place to stay, great location. Owners were upfront about the downstairs heat not working. Kitchen was well stocked with cooking essentials. Easy check in/out! Was a perfect experience for our first time as air bnb'ers! "
17479137,159110275,2017-06-09,6548690,Tim,"The house was great, upstairs had bedrooms and a bathroom, downstairs had a remodeled bathroom, kitchen and master bedroom, with outside access attached to the bedroom. The beds were very comfortable. Cable tv was nice to have and the two monterey bay aquarium passes were a great value, (two normal adult tickets are $100). 
Everything was close. 20 min walk to lovers point beach, 5 min drive to point pinos lighthouse or 5 min drive to the aquarium in the opposite direction. We loved the house, it even got an enthusiastic  2 thumbs up from the wife! We would love to stay here again, Thanks!

17479137,160784864,2017-06-15,14458424,Melissa,"This place is a gem!! It's in a lovely location in Pacific Grove. The street in front looks big but is totally quiet. The property is thoroughly enclosed - great for kids and dogs - and there's beautiful walking/running/cycling right out the door. An easy walk to the water, a quick drive or slightly longer bike or bus ride to places like Carmel. Joe and Kathy were super-responsive and very generous - they even left us a cake stand because they knew I was baking a cake for my mom's birthday while we were there. The dog bed and biscuits are a sweet touch. We're hoping to come back annually!"
17479137,163874472,2017-06-25,68401248,Mick,"Joe was great to deal with, quick to respond and his home was beautiful. The location was wonderful for nice evening strolls to Pacific Grove and Lovers Point and perfect for days out in Monterey and Carmel. Will definitely return."
17479137,168941144,2017-07-10,3192176,Clemens," This is a wonderful house in a great location very close to everything Monterey has to offer! Loved the new appliances in the kitchen, great TV, and plenty of room for us three! Would love to come back here anytime!"
17479137,169798132,2017-07-13,74501959,Gregg,"Amazing, quiet location, and a very spacious, well-equipped and comfortable house. The kitchen and bathrooms were incredibly well stocked, the beds were comfortable, parking directly in front was easy, and the beach chairs and yoga mat were a nice touch. We walked to the beach, to restaurants, to a great bakery, etc. The aquarium member guest passes alone are a $100 bonus value, on top of the already great value of this property. One very small thing: The master bedroom does not have a door. The layout is such that it's still relatively private. The den/TV room (with couch) is between the master bedroom and the living room, with no door between any of those three rooms, but you turn around a corner, so you can see into a small part of the bedroom from the den, but you can't see in at all from the living room (from there you can only see into the den).  It was fine for us, but just an FYI for folks for whom that might be an issue. Both the bedroom and second den upstairs have doors."
17479137,170502920,2017-07-15,33313301,Xinlu,"Good place which is nearby beach, also close of Carmel sea village and 17 miles .Plenty of food material and equipment of outside "
17479137,174112518,2017-07-24,70709525,Mark,This place exceeded our expectations.  Joe & Kathy were great to deal with and the value and facilities of this house are the best I have experienced with AirBnb.  The fire pit and grill were a huge hit and helped us to enjoy some quality time together.
17479137,205755859,2017-10-22,25172529,Caitlin,"The cottage is absolutely charming! Beautifully appointed, clean, comfortable, homely, and a great base from which to explore the surrounding area.

Joe and Kathy were communicative, obliging and thoughtful hosts. Complementary passes to the aquarium and recommendations for local spots to eat were much appreciated.

Highly recommended!"
17479137,209991052,2017-11-06,101294914,Esther,"We were looking for the ideal place for three good friends to get together for the weekend to relax and enjoy time together.  This home was perfect.  The location was ideal. We were able to walk throughout Pacific Grove and to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and through Monterey.  Joe and Kathy were wonderful hosts.  They were extremely responsive to any questions we had.  The house was clean, comfortable and the decor was very nicely done as a beach house.  The beds were comfortable and the house accommodated all three of us nicely.  We plan to return."
17479137,213387281,2017-11-20,126333126,Anne-Marie,Good base for Monterey and a welcome bonus of two guest passes to aquarium. Thanks!

17479137,214113260,2017-11-24,13169731,Dina,"We were able to share two nights with our daughter, her husband, our teen and two vizslas in this  beautiful, quiet neighborhood. The house and yard provided ample, safe space and luxury touches where our family was able to share thanksgiving together. The hosts provide everything you need for a lovely beach vacation and a serene retreat in their stunning home! Thank you for being pet friendly!"
17479137,214874041,2017-11-26,5180693,Christian,"Our family had a such a great weekend at this Airbnb. Our hosts were communicative and left us snacks and grapefruit shandy :)
Location is central to many great places in pacific grove and Monterey. The house also was very quaint and provided ample space and room for our family of 4. We will definitely come visit again!"
17479137,217993773,2017-12-10,67139413,Carmen And Toby,"This house is fantastic. It's clean, well stocked, well decorated and well located. Joe was also very responsive. It is a nice place for a dog, and there is a lovely dog park just a few blocks away. The only thing that was a little confusing was the heating, it seems the system doesn't evenly heat the house. "
17479137,218745687,2017-12-14,69857428,Frank,"Joe and Kathy’s Pacific Grove House is very nice and we enjoyed our stay there.  When they say “help yourself to anything in the refrigerator or pantry” they’re not making an idle offer; there was enough food and drinks  in the kitchen that you could stay for several days without going shopping. The house is nicely furnished and decorated and kitchen and bathrooms are remodeled. Joe and Kathy were responsive when we had any questions. We would gladly stay there again, and would recommend it to our friends"
17479137,220307295,2017-12-21,7536313,Sandra,"Joe's place is exceptionally well stocked, amazingly clean, tastefully decorated. I have stayed in many (Hidden by Airbnb) and Airbnb houses and this house is by far the most thoughtfully presented with ample supplies, top-of-the-line kitchen ware and appliances, comfortable beds.  Really impressive.  The fenced areas are fine for a dog and the amenities provided (beautiful dog bed, nice dishes, treats, and so on) would delight any dog. The master bedroom and sitting/media room were perfect for the two of us. The beautiful Christmas decor was a nice touch. Highly recommended if you are staying in Pacific Grove."
17479137,221208649,2017-12-25,23264000,Mari,Wonderful place. Highly recommended.
17479137,222080465,2017-12-28,7484892,Doris,"This was one of the best airbnb houses that we have stayed in (and we have stayed in a lot)!!! Location is perfect, just steps away from the gorgeous Monterey coastline, shops and restaurants. The house was clean, beautiful, thoughtfully decorated, with tons of amenities. It was also so perfect or people with pets (they had dog bed, toys, and dog bowls). Our puppy loved it and so did we! Would love to come back and stay at Joe and Kathy's place again!"
17479137,227710184,2018-01-15,164489209,Colleen,"This house is wonderful! Clean, well furnished and a beautiful location. Short walk to the beach and the park. Highly recommend!"
17479137,230242955,2018-01-27,21741589,Scott,Our family loved staying here.  Very clean and great touches about the house. Great communication.  It is a very nice and quiet neighborhood
17479137,234445924,2018-02-12,6823443,Ben,"Great little home, walking distance to lighthouse ave shops and restaurants, and lovers point! Would definitely stay again!"

17479137,241326361,2018-03-08,73942193,Katie,"Their place was amazing! We absolutely loved it, as did our pups! It’s a wonderful location and easy walking to the ocean. Thank you again!"

17479137,248109459,2018-03-30,23003630,Elizabeth,"Charming, clean, homey cottage-a fabulous place to stay! Perfect space for us and our 2 teens & small dog. Everyone had enough space. Loved the hot shower, comfortable beds, decor, ammenities and location. Beach was walking distance away. Quiet, safe neighborhood. It felt like staying in a relative’s home being able to enjoy drinks and snacks from the kitchen. A wonderful experience! Thank you so much!"
17623471,140744766,2017-03-31,7991427,Jade,"Dave and Lee were great hosts, we really enjoyed our stay!"
17623471,148869798,2017-05-01,3505862,David,"Dave & Lee's place was by far the nicest Airbnb rental I have stayed at, and I have stayed at plenty! I stayed here for one whole month with my partner and two large dogs. They were VERY accommodating towards the pups and us.

The living space:
The house itself was quite large and beautifully decorated! The living room was furnished with two very comfortable sofas and a large flat screen tv along with a cozy fireplace. The kitchen was spacious and fully stocked with all the essentials we needed to make a nice home-cooked dinner.  The two bedrooms upstairs were furnished with very comfortable queen/king size beds and decent closet space.  Then, there’s the large patio deck with furniture and a BBQ grill! You will not be disappointed, and will probably be tempted to stay here longer than you had planned. ☺

The area:
THIS IS WHAT MADE IT PERFECT. The house is located less than a 5-minute drive to pebble beach, which is also a dog-friendly beach (off-leash).  Dave and Lee were kind enough to let us use their guest passes to get into the club, which saved us quite a bit of money. Also, there are dog friendly (off-leash) hiking trails that are within walking distance to the house. We definitely took advantage of this and went to the beach and trails EVERYDAY. Groceries and restaurants are also less than a 5-minute drive as well.

So… if you’re currently reading this… just book it already. You won’t regret it!

17623471,150332520,2017-05-07,71562725,Sara,"Very nice/comfortable home. Hosts were very welcoming, accomodating, responsive to inquiries and sharing tips on points of interest. Location is perfect, near food, beach and sights of  the PA and Monterey area. We'd highly recommend this home."
17623471,154095107,2017-05-22,124167914,Sharon,"Set up very nice. Love the mid-century modern interior. It was perfect for us, we enjoyed our stay."
17623471,154949730,2017-05-26,95323466,Cindy,"My family and I stayed at Dave and Lee's home for 3 nights and had a great vacation because of it! Their home is located in close proximity to the beach and shops. They had all the amenities there that we needed, the beds were very comfortable. Dave and Lee went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed during our stay. Though Lee and Dave can access the kitchen, they chose not to in order to respect our complete privacy during our stay."
17623471,156261278,2017-05-29,3112913,Pauline,"Dave & Lee's home is a wonderful place to stay. It's Beautifully decorated, super well-equiped (kitchen, bed linens,towels...). 5 minutes drive to main entrance of the beautiful 17-mile road, to asilomar beach and easy access to Carmel, big sur...
We had a wonderful time here and we would come back again. Highly recommended!"
17623471,156932348,2017-06-01,7834615,Sarah,This house was located very conveniently near the gate to 17 mile drive and all of the local attractions. We had a lovely time.

17623471,158464560,2017-06-06,129471285,Debbie,"We really enjoyed our stay at this lovely, well-decorated, and comfortable home.  The backyard space was relaxing, the kitchen was well stocked, the beds were comfortable and the shower pressure was great.  Our entire family - - including the pups - - had a marvelous time.  The hosts, Dave & Lee, were wonderful and so welcoming (and yet respectful of our privacy).  It was such a great introduction to Airbnb.  We'll definitely be back again in the future!"
17623471,160379677,2017-06-13,125451286,Charanay,"Dave and Lee were wonderful hosts. Dave was always available via text and responded promptly. Their home was beautiful and yet comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. Every now and then, you'd get to see a family of deer next to their house which was a treat for the kids and I. "
17623471,161765902,2017-06-18,112943574,Akira,"Great hosts, place, and value! Dave and Lee's place has everything you will need to make your trip in Monterey incredible. "
17623471,163881610,2017-06-25,116257170,Fiona,"We really enjoyed our stay in Pacific Grove. Dave & Lee's place is lovely and was a really comfortable base from which to explore the beautiful local area, 17 mile drive, Carmel and Big Sur coastline. "
17623471,164825758,2017-06-29,128593009,Janet,"We found our stay to be quiet and relaxing. Beds were super-comfy, clean and fresh. The house was well-stocked with all the necessities. We enjoyed the gas stove and oven, and made good use of the kettle. The location is great- being on 17 Mile Drive means you're central to everything. Dave was responsive to questions and made it easy to explore Pebble Beach. Instructions were detailed and clean-up was quick and easy. It was like 'home away from home' which is what we were looking for. "
17623471,165721490,2017-07-02,130013996,Mike,"Great location on 17mi. Close to parks, ocean and aquarium. Highly recommended!"
17623471,167992030,2017-07-08,120272893,Emily,"Great base to explore Monterey and surrounding area- cosy living space with fantastic fireplace, well stocked kitchen, and just fantastic beds.
Neighbourhood is very quiet and near lots of amenities.
There was only one snag- no washer, dryer, or drying rack so if you are super active (kayaking, snorkelling, surfing) you may struggle to dry things out."
17623471,170422652,2017-07-15,116963385,Alistair,"We had a great stay at Dave and Lee's. A beautiful house, in a quiet area which is still really close to the beautiful beaches and to Monterey. Thoroughly recommend!"
17623471,172017328,2017-07-19,6296347,Robyn,"We are former locals looking for a well located, quiet, clean, little charmer and we found it. This house has everything you'll need for a carefree vacation. It is conveniently located close to Pebble Beach and a quick walk to Asilomar Beach. The kitchen is well-equipped, the beds are comfortable and the outdoor deck was just a great added bonus. We hope this place doesn't get too popular because we plan to come back soon and hope to stay here again. "
17623471,172719311,2017-07-21,96991156,Charlotte,"Superb property in a great location with excellent hosts. we loved the BBQ and deck. Comfortable beds, clean and well stocked kitchen, we would highly recommend this property. "
17623471,174622399,2017-07-26,121140937,John,"This is a cozy little nest in a quiet neighborhood close to PG. the owners are very hospitable and the place is well appointed and stocked. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable home base on the Monterey Peninsula, this is a good choice."
17623471,176794900,2017-07-31,126834793,Nichole,"This charming home is a idyllic base for exploring Monterey and surrounding areas.  We stayed with our 4 children and it was a great vacation!  We loved being so close to the aquarium, the tide pools and Big Sur hiking, yet still having a quiet place to retreat in the evenings. Dave and Lee were absolutely fantastic about communicating, making us feel welcome, responding quickly to questions, and offering area recommendations.  The home is well stocked and full of thoughtful small touches that make it truly comfortable and enjoyable. The beds are comfy and the the shower is great - 2 hallmarks of a good place to stay in my book!  Loved the quality linens and towels, and the kitchen full of all necessities. Staying anywhere with 4 kids can get a little noisy, so we very much appreciated Dave and Lee expressly indicating that they do not expect guests to tip-toe around the house on their account (shared walls) but to feel at home and laugh and live.  All in all it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying here!"
17623471,182827390,2017-08-15,46472145,Brian,"Both Dave and Lee were great responding to any questions both before and after our arrival.  The home was very clean and superbly decorated.  Being just two of us, we didn't use one of the guest rooms, but the home would comfortably accommodate another couple, or children.  The highlight was a short 10 minute walk to Asilomar Beach, and I tried to make it out at least every other day of our 12 day stay.  I would have liked to have used more of their recommendations for dining, but Phils is a must! (But bring a sweater).
We ended up staying in to cook a bit, and unlike many Hosts, Dave and Lee keep e kitchen stopped with a full complement of cookware and spices which can make the difference in a longer stay!  Definitely recommend if you are looking for a place on the peninsula!"
17623471,185850679,2017-08-22,14829860,Laura,"A lovely, clean space to call home. Thoughtful touches everywhere, things like oil and sugar available were perfect, enabled easy cooking. Loved having the outdoor space and BBQ. The hosts couldn't do more for us. Loved how easy check in was."
17623471,186790195,2017-08-25,78444840,Iammykids,"Dave and Lee are the best hosts ever!!!!

We have been to many B&Bs and hotels around the area of Carmel for the past few years and nothing compared to Dave and Lee's home!!! My kids love love love the home (Website hidden by Airbnb) son especially love the wall arts, and my daughter enjoyed the fireplace....besides the couches hahahaha!! I loved the kitchen (being able to make meals for my family is my joy) and my husband enjoyed  BBQing in the back patio.

Their home is centrally located to Monterey and Carmel, which is a gigantic plus!!!!! We did not have to sit in any traffic or take any highway to go anywhere, or sight see. Everything is 5mins or less!!! That's awesome!!!! We love love love the home and wish we could have stayed a little longer!!! We were sad to leave but very glad we had stayed with Dave and Lee!!!
 Thank you again for a wonderful time!!"
17623471,189772698,2017-09-02,43405704,Rob,"Exactly how I think airbnb is designed to be! A fantastic house offering lots of space for us and the three kids (aged 9, 7 and 4). Dave and Lee's communication was excellent and our check in, directions etc couldn't have been better. They were so quick to respond and the house was probably even better than the pictures suggested (which already looked good!). Our hosts were unobtrusive but on hand/available whenever needed. We would thoroughly recommend this place for anyone wanting to explore Central California area. Thanks both."
17623471,190704956,2017-09-04,19332676,Madhavan,"We loved Dave & Lee's place - neat, very nicely decorated, and at the center of pretty much everything !! Pebble beach, spanish bay, asilomar beach, butterfly santuary, small shopping malls, chains stores, etc are all within 5-10 mins drive and some just within 10 mins walk. Dave was really responsive and kept me completely informed before my arrival and during our stay there. I would really recommend Dave & Lee's place to anyone out there.

We happened to visit during a really hot weekend (upper 90's and humid). There was no air conditioning or fans in Dave's home. This is not really a complaint as pretty much all homes in Monterey have no AC. This is just a note for other visitors to bring a portable fan in case the weather prediction is warm to hot when they visit. 

The backyard setup was so nice but we didn't spend enough time in time Monterey to enjoy some grilling n chilling time. If we were to stay at Monterey again, we will be sure to reach out to Dave & Lee again."
17623471,192984468,2017-09-11,87363271,Jill,Very comfortable and impeccably clean! Well equipped and great value!
17623471,195294466,2017-09-18,57542621,Dawn,"My husband and I stayed here while we attended the Monterey Jazz Festival this past weekend.  It was a great place to unwind and relax. This was our first Airbnb experience and Dave and Lee made it easy from the time we made the reservations to the time we left.  Their home is beautiful, and the photos honestly reflect what to expect.  The location is in a quiet tree lined street and close (5-15 minutes drive or walk)  away from anything that you may want to visit in the area.  It was great to have a fully functional kitchen.  It's nice to have the option of stopping at the grocery store and preparing your own meals, and save the expense of eating out for every meal.  Dave and Lee thought of everything that you may need and they were only a text or phone call away should your need anything."
17623471,197040870,2017-09-24,119847127,Natasha,We had a wonderful holiday at Dave and Lee's place!

17623471,205028761,2017-10-20,52562008,Brittany,"We stayed at Dave and Lee's place for 4 days and it was the perfect trip! Dave and Lee reached out a few days before our trip via text and email with specific instructions for us and were very welcoming from the start. I felt completely comfortable when we arrived at the airport that we would easily be able to find and enter the house.  When we arrived, the house was exactly as pictured. Beautiful living room and bedrooms, clean bathroom and kitchen. The house was stocked with anything you would need- fully stocked kitchen with pots, pans, dishes and even cooking spices. There is even a fenced in backyard that our kids loved to play in. It was centrally located- we were easily able to get to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and even took a trip to Pebble Beach.  When we left, our son left a toy in the couch and Dave was kind enough to reach out to see if we needed it mailed. Our 8 year old daughter loved the house so much that she begged us to move there.  I would absolutely recommend a stay at Dave and Lee's beautiful house- incredibly gracious hosts and an unforgettable trip!"
17623471,206306705,2017-10-24,31328214,Asia,"If you’d like to feel like at home in beautiful surroundings and among two perfect hosts there is no other place in the Monterey region. We may come back with our two children, the stay was great, we have even seen roe deers around the corner, how cool is that? Thanks once again Dave and Lee."
17623471,207247857,2017-10-28,135752356,Penelope,"Dave and Lee’s rental was amazing! It is so private and they put a lot thought into the mid century modern decor. We felt like we were staying a a five star hotel! It has everything you need. You honestly don’t need to bring anything but yourselves. They were so helpful with any questions. We had such a great time! Star gazing on the deck and making s’mores was one of many highlights! In addition, the proximity to the beaches and restaurants was perfect. We can’t wait to get some time off and book with them again. We highly recommend!"
17623471,209898374,2017-11-06,12222672,Diane,Dave and Lee’s hospitality and quick communication made our stay easy and comfortable. We were greeted with a bottle of California wine when we arrived. The home was immaculate and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with those essentials that you somehow forget to buy for a meal. Wonderful stay and we will definitely come back.
17623471,210690919,2017-11-10,235494,Katherine,"We brought our two little dogs with us. Dave was very accommodating.  The Airbnb is just as described, comfortable, clean and well appointed.  It was a very pleasant stay indeed."
17623471,211851498,2017-11-14,38305676,Cindy,"Dave and Lee's home was a delight; easy directions, good and prompt communications. Their home is quiet, clean, and beautiful. A stones throw from the beautiful coastline, and even had a visit from a couple deer. I would recommend this home to anyone who wants a peaceful, sweet place to stay!"
17623471,213715128,2017-11-22,79871360,Jim,"If you are hesitant about an on-site host, don’t be!  Dave and Lee were perfect.  Super attentive and informative when we needed them, otherwise completely unobtrusive.  Their place is stylish and comfortable.  Great period furnishings!  And do make it a point to meet Dave and Lee. They are a treasure trove of information that only the locals know.  We really enjoyed our stay and you will too."
17623471,214876113,2017-11-26,7323646,Michelle,"Dave & Lee are fantastic hosts-they are friendly, responsive, give great local suggestions and give you privacy despite living on-site (separate space). They also made our furry family members feel right at home! We stayed for Thanksgiving and, as a chef, I came over prepared for making dinner based on previous Airbnb experiences elsewhere. Dave and Lee have a well-stocked kitchen with almost anything you’d need in terms of kitchen equipment to make Thanksgiving dinner. All you need are groceries! We also loved being able to get on their guest list to go to Pebble Beach whenever we wanted to let the dogs run off-leash and watch the sunset. Photos of the place are accurate. It is just over 1 mile to the beach with a great walking trail close by and easy driving distance to Monterey, Carmel and all the local outdoor activities. We would stay there again!"
17623471,218023493,2017-12-10,7738193,Christophe,"The place and the owners are great, if you like cooking there more than enough gears to play with, it's one of the best place I have been when I come to CA,very quiet, close to everything, helpful owners, good quality price, I will get back for sure."
17623471,220109830,2017-12-20,69857428,Frank,"Dave and Lee’s house in Pacific Grove has everything you need for a great getaway. Lots of windows and open beam ceiling in the living/dining room lend a nice, open feeling, and plenty of sunlight. The location is perfect for walking to the beaches or open spaces. They are dog friendly hosts, and our Labrador, Gina, was quite taken with her large sheep skin bed.  They are members of the Pebble Beach Club and were able to provide us with free access to 17 Mile Drive for our entire stay. You can drive to Spanish Bay and let your dog run free on the beach.  Dog lovers will also appreciate the close proximity of the Rip van Winkle Open Space, where dogs are also allowed off-leash to enjoy the many trails through the forest behind Pebble Beach. We would recommend Dave and Lee’s house to our friends."
17623471,221477299,2017-12-26,46872,Amber,Communication with Dave and Lee was seamless. The house was very clean and as expected per the photos. We had a lovely holiday and a great stay in their home.
17623471,222425779,2017-12-29,5588536,Ivan,We have been using Airbnb for years and this is by far one of the best experiences we had. Dave & Lee are fantastic hosts and we hope to visit their place soon.
17623471,223759333,2018-01-01,7126642,Christina,"Wonderful and comfortable home for our family of 2 kids and a dog!  The hosts were always available and prompt whenever we had questions. They provided very clear instructions and lists of things to do in the area. We slept like babies in the comfortable beds and enjoyed exploring the Pacific Grove community, with only steps away from trails, beach, coffee shops/restaurants/bookstores.  We enjoyed being in proximity to both Asilomar and Pebble beaches as well. This was one of our best AirBnB experiences so far and we would come back again."
17623471,225522308,2018-01-06,4323472,Dan,"Fantastic location! Staying here you are only a few minutes from world class views and beaches. The complementary access to Pebble Beach was a nice addition. The beds were comfortable and everything worked as expected. Despite the hosts living in a separate part of the house, its more similar to just a shared wall on a duplex, you wouldn't know they were there. We had a fun time despite the rain."
17623471,226844127,2018-01-12,26706431,Jordan,"Amazing place. I love the mid century style and architecture of the home. Great backyard space for your dogs. Large and comfortable bedrooms and just a wonderful space in general. Location was perfect, as it was situated right between Monterey and Carmel. Hosts were very communicative and helpful. All in all, I would highly recommend this home and will definitely return."
17623471,229296107,2018-01-22,3543700,Caitrin,"We had such a wonderful time at Dave and Lee's! The house is really ideal - super comfortable, great location, fully stocked kitchen. Highly recommended!"
17623471,234184951,2018-02-11,110990511,Rich,"Great people, great house, great location in PG.  A short drive to pretty much all the spots you would need to hit up.  Very comfortable home to spend a week in!"
17623471,236632467,2018-02-19,167450370,Mary,"This return to the Monterey peninsula for my daughter and myself (we both graduated from DLI) was highly anticipated and the accommodations did not disappoint. From the mid-century feel of the accommodations to the thoughtful little touches, Dave and Lee's place added so much to the memory collection.  It also set the trip apart from other trips to Monterey and made the experience all that more special.  From the little patio out back, to the fireplace on cool evenings to the homey touches in the kitchen and bath with necessities to smooth the stay, we were thrilled with our first Airbnb experience.  Dave was immediately accessible by text to answer any questions and they allowed us our privacy while being helpful and made sure we had Lee's number as well.  This place is definitely on our list upon our return.  Thank you so much to Dave and Lee!"
17623471,238774624,2018-02-26,6774853,Carly,"A warm, comfortable space that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed! Very clean, stylish home with plenty of space and a nice open floor plan. Great location, very central. Dave and Lee were very helpful and quick to reply to texts. We had a wonderful time!"
17623471,241314378,2018-03-08,33576627,Elaine,"This place is fabulous. It's stylish, close to everything, quiet, fantastically outfitted, and--our favorite part--super dog friendly. The hosts were great communicators, really attended to every detail, and couldn't have made it anymore welcoming. Everything about the place was comfortable while also being cute and very aesthetically pleasing. Definitely plan to return and highly recommend."
17623471,242680550,2018-03-12,17895296,Kate,"I really love midcentury design and loved Dave & Lee's home.  House goals for how I would like my own home setup someday with the high ceilings, stylish furniture and fantastic patio.  If you stay here, go to Pebble Beach!  The 17mi drive was totally worthwhile.  I wish I'd had more time to take a golf lesson.  Pacific Grove was such a cute spot with the lighthouse and charming town center, close to Carmel & Monterey and an easy drive to Big Sur.  Strong recommend, I'd happily stay again if I find myself back in that part of California!"
17623471,244823012,2018-03-19,231023,Gerrie,We had a very lovely stay at your beautiful home. Our dogs loved the special dog lounge... just for them.
17623471,247240699,2018-03-27,32056428,Marcus,"Dave and Lee’s place was fantastic. They were hospitable, the location is perfect, and the house had everything we needed for a great stay. Thank you!"
17623471,250340312,2018-04-04,57183528,Molly,"My family and I just stayed at Dave and Lee's place on 17 Mile Drive in Pacific Grove and had a wonderful experience.  Not only is the area one of the most beautiful corners of California, but the house is so perfectly located between Carmel and Pacific Grove that all points of interest are super easy to get to.  The house is a perfect gem of mid-century modern and is so well appointed with fantastic linens, and an abundance of fluffy towels that will ruin us for any future hotel visit! The home has 2 beautifully decorated and spacious rooms with comfy beds and lots of windows.  There is a great back deck with a large outdoor sectional for relaxing under the beautiful trees.  The kitchen is well equipped with great appliances, fun dishes and an impressive spice drawer.  
Dave and Lee are also very easy to communicate with and responded very quickly to any questions we may have had.  They provide very detailed information on the house itself, as well as great local restaurant suggestions, beach directions and area activities.  It's very obvious that Dave and Lee want their guests to have a wonderful time, and it certainly was the case with us.  We highly recommend their home and look forward to a future visit for us as well!"
17623471,250960941,2018-04-06,126523672,Regina,"Dave and Lee were fabulous hosts - they were always quick to respond, and the local/insider info they shared was super helpful - it made such a difference in our trip! The accomodations were comfortable, clean and really tasteful - we felt right at home. Thank you - we'll be back!"
17623471,253225850,2018-04-13,63525411,Mary Jo,"This is our third year in a row vacationing in Pacific Grove and hands down our favorite home.  It took only 12 minutes for an easy walk to one of the most beautiful beaches you will find anywhere.  We cooked in most nights with our seven year old grandson and found nothing lacking to make all three meals, including a great grill on the lovely deck.  We enjoyed the Pacific Grove Monday afternoon farmers market to get our hands on delicious strawberries, produce and fresh flowers.  Parking our car right outside our door with only one step up made in and out easy.  The fireplace was a cozy warmth to wake up to with our morning coffee.  The kitchen was well stocked with modern appliances.  The house is so bright, sunny and furnished tastefully.    Dave communicated well and had everything ready at our check in.  The very few questions we had were answered immediately by text.  Bedrooms were comfy as can be with plenty of storage.  We could actually hear the surf from our bedroom window at night as the neighborhood was just that quiet.  A park nearby made playing some baseball easy and fun.  Thank you to Dave and Lee for making our stay just what a vacation should be, easy, fun, clean , comfy space....just perfect. Our seven day weather: sunny and gorgeous!
Tip for great locally sourced ice cream....Revival....try the Eucalyptus Mint in their made on the spot waffle cones...cannot get this everywhere!
Cannot wait till next year to revisit what is becoming one of our favorite towns!"
17623471,254126882,2018-04-15,183630014,Carl,"Located on 17 mile drive, just a few blocks from Inn at Spanish Bay. Moderate walk to Asilomar Beach, which is fabulous.  Quick drive into Monterey.
Very comfortable home, nicely furnished, in a great area."
17642147,138418206,2017-03-19,17051709,Monica,"Comfy bed, clean and great location. "
17642147,139463344,2017-03-25,40276898,Raf,"Cosy place, great location, one block from the ocean, and a short hop to Pacific Grove downtown."
17642147,139860906,2017-03-26,298064,Will,"My wife and I had a great weekend at Bryan and Rosie's place. Rosie is very responsive and the pre-trip communication and check-in were very smooth. The home is comfortable and accurately represented. The location is very close to the water and the beach trails, which are beautiful. "
17642147,141340657,2017-04-02,36276458,Veronica,"We had a lovely time at Bryan and Rosie's place. The location is ideal --  it is within walking distance to the ocean and to Pacific Grove's downtown. We were pleasantly surprised by the coffee and tea provided. They had a variety of kitchen amenities including a microwave and toaster. Of note, the master bedroom is located next to the main entrance of the duplex. So if you hear noises late at night, don't be alarmed. "
17642147,144428008,2017-04-15,88676515,Aaron,The place was literally a 5minute walk to the beach. Restaurants and nightlife was really close as well. 
17642147,147044572,2017-04-24,6542643,Joe,"Nice little cute and cozy spot in Pacific Grove.  One block from the water front.  No views from the apartment, with minimal windows.  
Great size for a traveling couple, although no couch or Tv for lounging.  A strictly sleep and get ready space.  
Bedroom has no windows and the kitchen has no hood so do not expect to do much cooking.  The shower in the bathroom is very tiny so expect to rub up against the walls and curtain.  The one towel they left for the two of us to share was stained and dirty and there was a pile of trash from the previous guest left under the sink.

Check in and out was a breeze and the parking spot allotted was a plus! Cellphone service was spotty (Verizon) and wifi was weak and not the best for staying connected.

All in all, not the worst place I've stayed, but for the price I most likely would not be back."
17642147,148351059,2017-04-30,12222521,Toni Elyzza 'Zen',"Rosie's place was the perfect little getaway for me and my husband. 

The space was clean, comfortable, and charming. The location was great - a walking distance to Pacific Grove, a quick ride to Monterey, Carmel and Pebble Beach. 

Joy was accommodating and always replied when I had questions. 

The space does not have a tv of radio but it was great cause we spent all our downtime reading books and drinking wine. Other than that, it was fully equipped with a Brita pitcher, toiletries, coffee, tea, cooking condiments, cookies and granola bars along with what Airbnb spaces typically have.

We will definitely be staying at Rosie's again. "
17642147,150705472,2017-05-08,16219378,Russ,Lovely stay!
17642147,151232541,2017-05-11,8479414,Steve,"If you want a servicable dark box to stay in a block from the coast that is adjacent to beauty, this is your place.  "
17642147,152061910,2017-05-14,124879618,Brennan,Really beautiful place in a perfect location. Great experience!!
17642147,153336230,2017-05-20,128776891,Leanne,My boyfriend and I had a good one night stay! Small apartment was great for what we needed after mountain biking at Fort Ord. Bed was comfortable.
17642147,153809970,2017-05-21,27241534,Sam,Stayed here for one night. Nothing flash but did the job. Nice cafes close and aquarium is not too far away. 
17642147,155677258,2017-05-28,17587396,Ben,"
Fantastic spot in an amazing area. Kitchen was sufficiently stocked to cook. Exactly what we were looking for. "
17642147,156732231,2017-05-31,42637301,Chelsea,The neighborhood is gorgeous. We walked 5 minutes with a cup of coffee and watched seals sunbathe on the rocks. Incredibly beautiful and walking distance to cafe.
17642147,157389074,2017-06-03,78993170,John,This was one of the nicest places I've stayed. 
17642147,158244098,2017-06-05,7120337,Damini,"The location of this place is excellent, close to lovers point. It's also very cosy for two people and the kitchen is very well equipped. We had a slight issue with the bathroom but communication was excellent, even late at night, and we got help immediately. "
17642147,158409512,2017-06-06,1520173,Tiffany,"Bryan and Rosie were fantastic hosts. Their place is charming and quite close to some great restaurants and the beach. Check-in was seamless and I had a fantastic time. This place is the perfect location if you'd like to explore Pacific Grove, Carmel, Pebble Beach (and 17 Mile Dr), and Monterey. "
17642147,160366081,2017-06-13,5356045,Carrie,"Pros: very comfortable bed and  sofa/chairs. Lots of light. Roomy. Outstanding location. Well-equipped kitchen. Communication and processes were easy. VERY responsive to a question about the heat not working and had it fixed in no time. Parking was not a problem at all. 
Neutral: if decorating means anything to you, this place could use some updating. Perfectly serviceable, however. No complaints. 
Cons: had to hunt down blankets for chilly nights/mornings. Some general instructions for where that kind of thing is located would be nice.

We had a lovely stay and we would bring our family back next time for a longer visit. "
17642147,160837278,2017-06-15,76793805,Naheed,"The host has two units in the same building and we were upgraded to the larger unit, therefore we cannot comment on this particular unit. The one upstairs is nice with a view of the ocean."
17642147,161891495,2017-06-18,41768320,Chris,"This place is in a great location.  Short walk to downtown Pacific Grove and to a couple of nice beaches up the street.  You have partial views of the ocean from the living room, which was awesome.  Easy parking right in front the place.  Surrounding area was quiet and calm, even over the weekend. Really enjoyed the place and would definitely recommend it.  "
17642147,163155280,2017-06-23,3104551,Jennifer,"Gorgeous place right by the oceanside. Walking distance to lovely restaurants and cafes. Very comfortable, beautiful decor and views."

17642147,167760827,2017-07-07,45806797,Kayla,Rosie's place is quaint and steps away from the beach. She gave us amazing suggestions of places to visit and we hit Pavel's Backerei every morning of our trip. Monterey is beautiful and the location is perfect. Our only gripe would be the seagulls. Their cries kept us awake throughout the night (although I'm assuming this must just be a Pacific Grove thing considering the seagulls are everywhere) Overall a great time! 
17642147,168574882,2017-07-09,135633362,Jessica,"We loved staying here. We could see the water from the apartment, and could walk to ice cream, play ground, groceries -- and the ocean! Also, it is bigger in real life than in the photos. Thank you for a great vacation."
17642147,169797361,2017-07-13,130423740,Steve,Awesome!
17642147,171797175,2017-07-18,51256624,Michael,Very nice place! Friendly people and very scenic. Good location right near the beach and walkable to the Main Street. Hosts also left a nice packet of recommendations which we tried. Had a nice night

17642147,173131563,2017-07-22,7728315,Sharon,We were down in the area for a wedding in Monterey so it was super convenient. We didn't get a chance to explore as it was a super quick trip but wish we had more time! It's really close to the water and cute area to explore. Would stay again!
17642147,173691469,2017-07-23,11163030,Deby,"Rosie's Place is wonderful!  The view is fabulous and the location is perfect.   Lots and lots of places to get to - all close by.  
Wonderful place to stay and relax."
17642147,174704251,2017-07-26,4636262,Kristine,We only stayed one night but found the flat to be incredibly convenient to the water/tide pools and totally comfortable for our family of 3 adults and 3 kids. Joy was super responsive and helpful. 
17642147,175814221,2017-07-29,59256354,Janene,"Wow, the location cannot be better. We walked easily to Monterey Bay Trail which meandered along the beautiful Pacific Ocean. There were many restaurants to choose from along the way. Bryan And Rosie’s place was tucked into a safe and welcoming area a block back from the beach. The condo was comfortable and well stocked. We were delighted by all the birds that visited the skylight. My grandson loved to watch them walk above him as he played on the floor in the front room."
17642147,177696990,2017-08-03,3991721,Terry & David,"Our stay at Rosie's Place was wonderful--the proximity to the beach, Lover's Point, and all of the shops and restaurants on Central Avenue made it an ideal location for us.  We knew we would be sharing the location with seagulls, but other than the birds, it was completely quiet.  A terrific place to stay--we will return, for sure."
17642147,180233217,2017-08-09,79865764,Brandon,"We had a wonderful stay and were able to see the area. It was easy to communicate with Joy, the parking was a little tricky but nothing unreasonable. Really enjoyed all the Jazz art in the home!"

There place is so cozy and a perfect spot to relax  and unwind.  They have equipped the place in a very very thoughtful way, so that the guest stay is comfortable!!

17642147,187879785,2017-08-27,15823150,Emma Miranda,Rosie's View is more spacious than I was expecting. The check in process was super easy thanks to manager Joy plus we got some great recommendations of local places to eat from her which made our stay very straightforward and comfortable. Both the rooms are equal sizes and have their own bathroom. The layout is great and the apartment is in a great spot for exploring the area. We had an excellent time.
17642147,190280077,2017-09-03,42530775,Eric,"This was a great value and stay overall. The host was very easy to get a hold of leading up to check in and other questions throughout the stay. We really enjoyed being close to the 17 mile trek and the bay. Also, there are tons of fancy soaps in there. Would stay again."

17642147,198004757,2017-09-27,148464080,Matthew,"Bryan and Rosie were amazing hosts!  They provided anything that you could possibly need, and their home was super cozy and right by the ocean.  We would totally recommend anyone visiting the area to stay at Rosies Place, Monterey was gorgeous and their home was 5 minutes from downtown.  Thanks again Bryan and Rosie!"

17642147,203020724,2017-10-13,79010838,Daniel,"Would highly recommend Bryan and Rosie’s place - very easy to get to, right next to the sea and close to the town center. More than enough space for parking, which was good for us as we were on a road trip down the coast! The beds are also SO comfortable. Thank you"
17642147,203267468,2017-10-14,124865715,Darren,Lovely spacious place in a magical part of the bay.  Great views one block away and sea breezes on the balcony.  Charming design.  2 baths is extra convenient.  A little tricky to warm the bedrooms and have privacy as the main heat is in the living room.  Comfortable and inviting vibes all around.

Who doesn’t want to wake up to the view of the coast!? Added bonus is that Lover’s point is a 5 minutes walk away! Clean and well stocked! Can’t wait to be back! Thank you Rosie, Joy, and Bryan!"

17642147,251306117,2018-04-07,53062244,Amanda,"The pictures do not do justice. The place is very spacious and the best stocked kitchen I’ve been to! Couldn’t ask for a better location. We we not even a block from the ocean, 2 blocks from the set of “Big Little Lies” and a mile from cannery row and the aquarium. Joy is beyond amazing and communication and making sure everything was all good to go. Myself and family will book again!!"
17642147,251918050,2018-04-08,59108055,Yibo,Great location. Very quite and close to ocean view and Monterey restaurants area. Would definitely come back next time
17749391,139911794,2017-03-26,22886932,Sean,The host canceled this reservation 143 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17749391,167373355,2017-07-06,123908819,DeAnne,"The house is in an amazing location right on the water. We had a great view. We were able to walk everywhere...the Aquarium, Cannery Row, along the water in PG and up to Lighthouse. The house is so comfortable with all the amenities. It felt like we were staying at a friend's house, not a rental. Upon arrival the host left us a welcome package. Can't wait to go back. "
17749391,174386362,2017-07-25,125440648,Marcus,"The view will knock you socks off. And the location gave us easy access to the Monterey Aquarium and great shops and restaurants in Pacific Grove. There is a bit of traffic, both cars & people, in front of the house, but we were never bothered by any noise problem. We loved our stay at Marci's and plan to return."
17749391,197743627,2017-09-26,134020273,Raina,"Beautiful location, walking distance to restaurants and the beach.  Great accommodations and communication with the owner."

17749391,208524510,2017-11-01,81149384,Trayce,"The location of this house says it all. Spectacular. Easy to walk or drive to anything. Looking out at the water, hearing the sea birds, and seeing the harbor seals from the bedroom window (!) -- all such a treat. The house was as described/pictured, and included everything we needed. We weren't big fans of the ""sleep number"" bed, but that is just a preference. Overall, we were happy and comfortable here, and had a great stay! Would go again."
17749391,210689649,2017-11-10,14716416,Susan,"Marci is a great host. Her house is perfectly located, close to restaurants and shops.  The view from the house is beautiful.  Everything was exactly as described and we really appreciated the snacks provided."
18707259,166555458,2017-07-03,12050813,Rouja,"Susan's place is lovely and charming! It's a short walk to Asilomar State Beach with amazing views, and a short ride to 17 Mile Drive in Pebble Beach and downtown PG. The kitchen is fully equipped with the cooking essentials you'd find in your home, even more, and the dinning room is nicely furnished to accommodate a big party like my family! The outdoor sitting and the BBQ area is another great place to bring everyone together and just hangout. The house is clean and bright, and it easily accommodates 10 people (12 starts to feel cramped). Susan is a very nice lady and super responsive, and it seems as though she truly enjoys being a host!! "
18707259,168062020,2017-07-08,134695099,Marc,Very nice and clean house. Easy walk to the beach and a short drive to downtown Monterey. We had a very enjoyable stay.

18707259,197208769,2017-09-24,114226167,Megan,"This lovely home in Pacific Grove is in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to the beach and the downtown area. We could tell right at arrival that the home had been set up with care, with beautiful and fun furnishings, helpful notes for our stay, and many useful items included like basic toiletries. The beds were comfortable, with plenty of extra pillows and blankets, and the kitchen had everything we needed. It was nice to have the table outside on the deck for enjoying the nice weather as well as the fire pit. Susan was great in answering any questions we had during our weekend. Thanks for a relaxing and wonderful stay!"
18707259,199372081,2017-10-01,76257216,Traci,"Amazing house great for a large group of people. Susan was great with communication and was so nice to accommodate some special
Requests.  The house was lovely in terms of setup, furnishings and appliances.  We were in the area for a wedding so we didn't have the chance to cook or spend much time at the house- but would love to come back another time and use the great kitchen!  Thanks again!!!"

18707259,209716092,2017-11-05,34605640,Ethan,Highly recommend. Updated interior and exterior allow for a splendid time. Surrounding fence allows for perfect privacy in your own mini compound. Very very short walk to the beach that has zero people at!
18707259,211388244,2017-11-12,140838411,Melissa,"The setup of this house was perfect for us.  It really provides for three separate areas (two bedrooms with shared bath off the main living area, private master, and back cottage with two sleeping areas and a bathroom) that made a great fit for our extended family gathering.  We enjoyed the quick walk down to the ocean, and hearing it with a peekaboo view of water from the garage roof deck.  Easy access to town and 17 mile drive as well.  We came to stay for a wedding, so we were busy, but wish we'd had a chance to enjoy the home (Website hidden by Airbnb) just darling, with such great style.  Susan was wonderful and responsive and we appreciated all the careful details that went into making this a great getaway.  We'll come again if we have events in the area!"
18707259,213079271,2017-11-19,23719868,Debra,"We loved staying at Susan’s place for my sisters 70th birthday. The house was absolutely perfect in every way. The decor is So Cal beach chic with attention to detail in every room. My sister is a chef so she brings her knifes wherever she goes. She said this was the first air BNB house where she felt it was truly a well stocked kitchen with plates, stem wear and serving platters galore. 

We had plenty of room for our large family to hang out in the yard, cook in the spacious kitchen, and enjoy our meals gathered around the very long dinning room table. 

The house is walking distance from the beach, lighthouse, and the butterfly sactuary. The neighborhood is quite which makes for a pleasant retreat after spending the day at cannery row."
18707259,214895121,2017-11-26,19991687,Nicole,"Really beautiful home very comfortable for a larger group. Enjoyed the yard and convince of the location. Close to ocean, golf course, butterfly sanctuary, aquarium etc."

The tiny house and its location exceeded our expectations. This experience set our expectations very high for future Airbnbs!
18731829,160828339,2017-06-15,30105723,Camille,"This cottage is super adorable and very comfortable. It has all the amenities you would want for a little getaway. Suzanne was a lovely host and was accommodating with our early check-in. The location is very central and walking distance to lots of restaurants and destinations. My partner and I especially loved enjoying a glass of wine in their beautiful yard, listening to their koi pond and soaking up the sun before going to dinner. We even got to play with their sweet Australian Shephards, Fred and Koda! It was a very pleasant stay all around and we would definitely stay again! "
18731829,161355521,2017-06-17,15199558,Tejas,Me and my fiance had a great time at Suzanne's place. The room is very cozy and comfortable and was done up really well by Suzanne.

She was very welcoming and helpful during the entire stay - checking in to make sure we had everything we needed was very appreciated. There were so many details and special touches in the cottage including some breakfast treats that we ate too quickly, a stocked fridge, and so on. The space was incredibly clean and the bed was comfortable. The grounds on the property were so beautiful! It created such a serene environment. The location was perfect and we were able to walk most places we needed to get to. I'd love to stay there again during my next visit. "

They were generous in the breakfast food provided, and also had an assortment of drinks in the fridge. They have a nice large backyard to enjoy during the day and at night. We had breakfast out there in the morning, and wine at night. The cottage is in a great location. We were able to get to most places by foot or by bike. It is a short walk to cannery row, the aquarium, and restaurants. The coastal bike trail is very close as well. We would definitely recommend others to stay here!"
18731829,168630512,2017-07-09,42020296,Tina,"Suzanne was a great host. We didn't meet but she was great in communicating. We checked in after the very late and she made it a breeze with instructions at the front door. The location was great, it's situated in a quiet neighborhood and very close to Monterey downtown and the aquarium. It's a very cute cottage in a beautiful lot. It was really easy to find parking with  Suzanne's instructions. The cottage was just what we needed for a weekend getaway. The drinks and treats provided were a nice touch. You might hear the neighbor's dog once in a while but it didn't bother us."
18731829,170145759,2017-07-14,77598709,Sid,Suzanne's little house is set in a lovely garden by a fish pond.  We enjoyed the tranquility and the friendly atmosphere.  Parking was easy on the quiet street and we appreciated the convenience of being within a very short drive of local attractions and restaurants.  Walking would be easy for people without our mobility limitations.
18731829,171120275,2017-07-16,11390876,Hillary & Edgar,"This studio was just perfect! It was secluded in the beautiful yard and felt very private. The location could not be beat!

Suzanne was a wonderful host and provided muffins, fruits and drinks. We would highly recommend a stay here and hope we can come back to visit!"

Suzanne and Rick were easy to get a hold of and quick to respond. They gave us some great dinner recommendations as well. We would love to come back! "
18731829,174406752,2017-07-25,76474738,Jenny,"We had a lovely time.  Suzanne and her husband were very responsive by text, allowed us to change one day when we needed to, made sure we had everything we needed.  The little cottage was both adorable and very practical.  They provided a bowl of fruit and yummy pastries, non alcoholic drinks for free and wine for a modest price.  There is a little fridge and a microwave should you need it.  The place was spotless and well thought out, there is a place for everything you need.  It is located in a lovely quiet garden.  Wifi was not super fast but enough for what we needed it for.  Walking distance to Pacific Grove downtown, the coast and the Monterey Bay Aquarium."
18731829,175004581,2017-07-27,18680412,Vincent,Amazing little Cottage  :D We had a great time in Monterey & Pacific Grove - The house is walking distance or a very short drive from the main attractions in town. Parking at the house is right at the front door ! And Suzanne was very responsive by texts for all the little questions we had :D Thanks again !
18731829,176809087,2017-07-31,101248193,Bre,Loved staying at this little cottage! Decorated very cute with everything that's truly needed for a weekend trip! Only a couple blocks from the ocean and soo easy to walk most everywhere. Fridge was stocked with drink and fruit/pastries were provided was a nice surprise. Backyard and courtyard was meticulously maintained with a beautiful pond and very friendly dogs.  Only small thing I would recommend adding to this adorable cottage would be a small flatscreen tv... but def not a necessity. Overall it was very pleasant and I would def stay here again. Suzanne had amazing communication and mad everything very easy and comfortable for my mom and I.
18731829,178117944,2017-08-04,7919203,Christopher,"Rick & Suzanne were gracious and welcoming hosts during our 5 day stay at their cottage.  They are responsive and made our stay a comfortable and memorable one.

Their home is located within a 10 minute walk of the Monterey Bay Aquarium (where you can pick up the free MST trolley that runs during the summer and will bring you around Monterey).  The cottage is perfect for a couple (although we had our 5 year old and were able to make it work for us) and although small has all the necessary amenities. Rick & Suzanne conveniently stock the fridge with water, juice, and soda.

We loved staying at their Pacific Grove cottage as a base to beaches in Big Sur/Carmel-by-the-Sea, Monterey, and to Pacific Grove, worth exploring in its own right.

You'll appreciate the beautifully landscaped surroundings with water feature, tree swing, outdoor table & chairs (and can even say hello to the two rabbits who live nearby)."
18731829,182076482,2017-08-13,25269599,James,"Suzanne was wonderful and the location is the best.  Be aware that the room is very small, the bed is only full size and there is no TV in the room."
18731829,185504584,2017-08-21,9474860,Jen,The cottage is darling and perfectly located in Pacific Grove!  Suzanne made everything really easy for us.  I will definitely rent this again!
18731829,187841441,2017-08-27,141899903,Julia,"This was our first AirBnB stay.  We were not disappointed.  We loved staying at the cottage!  It was our home away from home.  Complete with a water fall, running brook and fish pond.  It was relaxing to sit in the shade during the day with the gentle breeze in my hair while my hubby played golf; as well as, to sit nearby the brook under the stars at night to recount our day.  If you are looking for charm, cleanliness, and hospitality - this is the cottage to rent.  And, not to forget, private, perfect for a romantic weekend for two!  Our host, Suzanne, was gracious, communicative, and adaptable - as we got a late start leaving from home on the day of our arrival.  Home-baked goods and cold beverages were an unexpected and delicious extra touch.  A million thanks to Suzanne, her family and the bunnies..."
18731829,192096617,2017-09-09,38384472,John,Very nice cottage. The hosts were very friendly and yet gave you space if that is what you wish. They offered suggestions on places to go and for us that was to get away from the tourist area.
18731829,201108098,2017-10-07,9387282,Enrica,"We really enjoyed our stay at Monarch Garden Cottage! Rick gave us great suggestions to enjoy our visit to Big Sur, and Suzanne, though away during our visit, was very responsive in communications over email.
The Cottage is in a strategic location to explore Monterey's main attractions on foot. It’s indeed small, but equipped with all you will need for a short stay. Our six-month old son loved the fish pond in the large and well-kept yard."
18731829,202077629,2017-10-09,83397261,Loni,"Hosts were great, made it very convenient to check in/out.  The place is just as pictured, super clean, and very charming.  Great area to walk around.  Would definitely recommend.  :-)"
18731829,203837056,2017-10-15,143059355,Brett,Fantastic little cottage. Well cared for and comfortable. I’ll definayely be back.
18731829,204369426,2017-10-17,106334597,Katie,"Suzanne’s place is cute, cozy, and clean. She was excellent to communicate with. It’s walking distance to Cannery Row (about 15-20 mins) and Fisherman’s Wharf (about 30-40 mins). She stocked the mini fridge with sodas, water, and juice and had a bowl of fruit for us. Her and her husband (and their pups) are very friendly and welcoming and gave us good dinner recommendations. It was an excellent stay!"
18731829,205277278,2017-10-21,43882819,Andy,"Ideal. Close to town (both Pacific Grove and Monterrey), great hosts, quiet space (with cute yard bunnies). Great little cottage that is warm, cozy and we’ll definitely return!"
18731829,206509573,2017-10-25,5002906,Alexander,Cottage was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated. Had everything we needed. Complimentary waters/juices and fruits hit the spot.
18731829,207759494,2017-10-29,148111400,Robin,"We loved staying at Suzanne's place. Everything was as described in the listing. Accommodations were cozy and comfortable. We appreciated the snacks provided (fruit, juice, soda, water). Everything was perfect! We would definitely recommend Suzanne's place to visitors and would stay here again, if we return to the area."
18731829,209986823,2017-11-06,58404751,Sam,"Communication with Suzanne was perfect from the beginning. She is a very attentive and helpful host. The place is absolutely nice, clean and well equipped! The location is really convenient, safe and nice. We will definitely stay here again for sure! Thanks Suzanne"
18731829,213081512,2017-11-19,12870582,Aimee,We loved the neighborhood and proximity to local attractions.  Room was very clean and efficient.  Room heat and hot water were adequate but took some work to figure out.  Wish bathroom had a fan and own heater to minimize moisture from showers without having to open window.  We really appreciated the bottled water and fruit provided.  Great value!
18731829,214824878,2017-11-26,17270778,Justin,A charming room in a quiet and convenient location.  Suzanne was very responsive and easy to communicate with. The fruit and refreshments were a nice touch.  Overall a very pleasant experience.
18731829,219750124,2017-12-18,91966832,Elle,"Suzanne's guest house was such a little piece of heaven! It is nestled on the top of the hill where you can see views of the ocean. The backyard setting is so peaceful and serene too. Suzanne's hospitality and kindness were so appreciated by myself and my son. It was so convenient having street parking always available. The neighborhood was so quiet and safe too. The guest house has a very comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. The shower was always hot. The window looking out the bathroom looks out over the ocean near Cannery Row. The lighting in the guest house is bright and cheery in the morning because there are several windows. The coffee maker worked great and the reusable filter was convenient. The fridge was a medium sized mini fridge. So you can fit a bottle of wine, orange juice and milk with no problems and a few to go boxes. This is nice when you come back from dinner and want to snack the following afternoon! :) There is also a really nice closet so that you can hang your clothes and store your shoes. Above the hanging bar are a few spacious shelves too! And the kitchen is stocked with kitchen ware and enough space for your crackers and cookies or whatever youd put in your pantry at home. The heat works great and the windows open up nicely too. So staying here, you get that airy and free feeling that most hotels dont offer. I really enjoyed my stay at Suzanne's little cottage. She was so helpful and I felt like I was at a bed and breakfast inn. If you want to be near the heart of all the action of Pacific Grove and Monterey then this special place is perfect for you. Thank you Suzanne!"
18731829,223123080,2017-12-31,2871848,Joan,"Suzanne is a wonderful host! She is very welcoming, knowledgeable, and personable. Her cottage is very quaint and cozy. The property is beautiful and it’s location was perfect. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend Monarch Cottage."
18731829,224320170,2018-01-02,20670686,Evan,"Suzanne's place is quite cozy, in the backyard of her beautiful home in Pacific Grove. The garden is gorgeous and the accommodations were very nice. The only downside is that there was no hot water in the cottage -- this is an issue that's being fixed, but was not ideal for our stay. I'm sure it will be addressed right away. In any event, Suzanne and her husband were great hosts, very communicative, and accommodating."
18731829,225515478,2018-01-06,3395033,Theresa,Perfect for two people.  Close enough to walk to aquarium.  Lovely host.
18731829,227411263,2018-01-14,108882548,Mike,Wonderful location with stellar accommodations. Suzanne was a thoughtful and gracious host!
18731829,232398318,2018-02-04,16282508,Mitch,"Clean, cute, and close to all we wanted. This place was quiet and we loved that parking was just outside the gate. "
18731829,234126851,2018-02-11,34795863,Robert,"A wonderful little cottage, easy walking distance to Cannery Row and the coast along Pacific Grove. Parking was super easy and we had a great stay."
18731829,236668532,2018-02-19,55589393,Andrea,"The cottage was lovely! It's perfect for two guests. The cottage is charming and you can tell that Suzanne has a stylish eye as it was decorated so cute with everything coordinating. The location was quiet and convenient to walking to the trail along the waters' edge. The hot water takes some time to warm up, but once it did it was perfect, so just be patient :) 
Suzanne's communication was quick and she was so pleasant!"
18731829,238481822,2018-02-25,95742693,Nicholas,A great place to stay in Monterey Bay! Sunrise at Lover’s point is a must(2 min drive away).
18731829,241314693,2018-03-08,48774562,Mark,"Suzanne's cottage was a perfect fit for our trip to Monterey. The cottage is cozy, but they have a wonderful yard where my wife and I had coffee in the morning and wine at night. A peaceful and quiet setting. The location is great, walking distance to many restaurants and the bike path. We were out exploring most of our visit. Suzanne was very helpful with some great local tips. She checked in with us a couple times to see if we needed anything but also respected our space. She was great, thanks for a great trip!"
18731829,242676031,2018-03-12,8458199,Lily,"I could tell I would love the Monarch Garden Cottage from the pictures. It is a bit pricey, but after a fantastic weekend it was well worth the cost. The location is perfect- we walked to the aquarium & lovers point, which are each just a few blocks away. This neighborhood is safe and quiet, but gorgeous and fun to walk around. Suzanne has a beautiful home and garden, which is well kept by her and her husband Rick. Their dogs are sweet, quiet and friendly. Since they run a local BnB, the Cottage feels like a luxury accommodation! All things are thought of- snacks and juice in the fridge, shampoo, conditioner and hair dryer in the bath- with instructions to make our stay super easy! Suzanne gave us great local restaurant recommendations and helpful tips. We would absolutely stay here again! Highly recommend for those looking for a relaxing getaway."
18814170,156230542,2017-05-29,116339004,Tobias,"Thanks, Merry, the stay was wonderful. We found everything we needed and much more at your place. We didn't even expect that awesome view! I couldn't recommend this more. "
18814170,160824781,2017-06-15,2149059,Joe &  Mary,"My wife, young son, and I enjoyed our stay at Merry's place in Pacific Grove.  The space is well appointed, clean, comfortable, and in a quiet residential neighborhood. The view is fantastic (looking northeast over the Monterey Bay). We enjoyed some down time reading and napping with whales in site as our little one rested in the other room.  

If you don't mind a 1/2 mile walk one way to the aquarium or to Lover's Point, this spot is great for you. It sits atop a hill though, so if you are adverse to a calf workout after checking out otters, than you may elect to drive about 1 minute down the hill (parking takes longer than the drive by far).

Being in charming Pacific Grove was a treat. We found lots of great food to eat (if you like a good gluten-fest, go to Pavel's Backerei), yummy coffee, and tasty juice bar. And if you just want some playground time with a little one, like we did, there is a school right across the street with a few good options.

I would recommend Merry's place, gladly, to friends, family, and anyone who is looking for a relaxing getaway replete with all the modern conveniences.

"
18814170,161912773,2017-06-18,40734398,Samantha,"This was hands down one of my best Air Bnb experiences. The place was so well appointed with new appliances, furniture, etc. I really enjoyed the location and view from the balcony! You can even see the ocean from the master bedroom shower! 

I am from the area and needed extra space since we were having a lot of out of town guests and the location is so close to all of the major stops ie restaurants, aquarium, cannery row, etc. 

I was really happy with the place and hope to find a reason to come back!"
18814170,163960922,2017-06-25,2424772,Adam,"The pictures didn't do the place justice. The location was great and the unit very quiet. We had a bit of a rough trip getting there, and were only able to stay one of the three nights we paid for due to a cancelled flight, but the unit was a perfect place to collapse into bed before hitting the road the next day. "
18814170,165065554,2017-06-30,77816695,Isabel,"Place was clean, great view. Would have preferred a little closer to the water considering the price but overall was a good experience."
18814170,166863300,2017-07-04,93880006,Ted,"Merry was very responsive to all my questions.  If she didn't know the answer to a question, she found a way to get me the answer.  Great property!"
18814170,168961994,2017-07-10,54600243,Walter,Our stay at Pacific Grove was perfect!  The location was very central to everything and the apartment was very new with rest amenities!  Definitely would come back to this place if we are ever down in Monterey again!  Thanks Merry!
18814170,171071309,2017-07-16,136631198,Jessica,"This unit is beautifully decorated and brand new. I loved the attention to detail and the small but helpful extra amenities that were provided. When we arrived, the check in process was easy and the pictures provided were accurate. The ocean view from the living room and deck were stunning. I enjoyed the half mile walk to downtown Pacific Grove and Lover's Point Park. We were lucky and had beautiful weather during our stay. I do wish there was an option for air conditioning because the rooms are often too warm for comfortable sleeping. You can open your sliding glass door or bedroom window, but then you can hear the neighborhood dogs barking sporadically throughout the night. I also could hear every step of the downstairs tenant. I don't know if he had lead feet or the insulation isn't sufficient. Overall, this is a beautiful place to stay within walking distance of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Pacific Grove, and Lover's Point. If you have noise sensitivity, this may be a concern for you."
18814170,172402756,2017-07-20,572276,Katherine,"What a lovely place to stay in Pacific Grove! Nothing beats the view from this place. It is as serene as serene can be to look out to the bay from the living room and bedroom. We stayed here with our young son for a family visit. The kitchen is very well-stocked with quality pots and pans, quality knives, and quality dishware and utensils. We loved dining in! The apartment is also very central to either Pacific Grove or Monterey. A short walk to everywhere we wanted to go. We also enjoyed the little touches of the interiors that made the place superior to many hotels: Bathrooms with ample shelving for your amenities under the sink, nice plush bath towels, and comfortable linens that you can really get a restful sleep on. I can't rave about this place more. You'll love it!"
18814170,174703156,2017-07-26,136302759,Haynes,"This is a wonderful, recently-updated duplex. We loved everything about our stay here. The bathrooms are beautiful, there is a pretty view of the water, and the kitchen was well-eqiopped with high-end appliances and very nice cookware. We ate in several times and had everything we needed to make a nice meal. The host's attention to detail and comfort were very much appreciated. It was one of the nicest vacation homes we have stayed in!"
18814170,180566290,2017-08-10,139969230,Frank,Absolutely beautiful premium apartment and very well appointed for comfort and convenience.
18814170,186853331,2017-08-25,144883218,Debra,The apartment was exactly as pictured. Everything was beautiful - brand new and spotless. Pacific Grove is a lovely town and the apartment has a nice view of the water. We very much enjoyed our stay there and recommend this apartment for a stay in the Monterey area.
18814170,190747102,2017-09-04,63318893,Nathan,"Place: very clean and modern place that is about 10-15 min walk to the Aquarium.  Location is quiet but certainly close enough to all the hustle and bustle.  All the amenities are practically brand new.  Checking in and checking out is a breeze.  

We came to Monterey with our toddler boys (2 and 4) and my folks - so a total of 6.  I slept with my younger one on the pullout sofa and my wife slept in the master with my older son.  My parents stayed at the 2nd bedroom.  Plenty of space.  

The place is on the top floor.  You can see the ocean from the deck.  There is someone who lives downstairs, who our two little toddler boys bothered to no end with their running and stomping.  We felt really bad.  I left a note when we checked out, apologizing for the commotion.  

Really have no complaints.  There were a Couple of little hiccups that didn't really bother us: 1) the toilet seats are always loose despite repeated attempts to tighten them; and 2) ran out of TP.  We just bought some at a nearby supermarket.  Again, no big deal for us.  

The weekend of our stay just happen to be during a heatwave.  Gilroy was nearly 110 on our drive down.  Monterey/Pacific Grove was about 95.  I don't think anyone has A/C and this place was no exception. It really got hot but luckily the 2 bedrooms have ceiling fans.  

Overall, this place was perfect for our stay.  We were able to take advantage of the kitchen and made breakfasts each morning for the family and the kids.  We then walked to the Aquarium with our strollers and snacks.  We stopped by Nob Hill Shopping Cntr on our way back and picked up some groceries like milk and fruits."
18814170,193230487,2017-09-12,149767428,Veenu,"Great location, very central!
Comfortable and clean with all the latest amenities. Comfortable beds and updated bathrooms and kitchen.
Loved sitting in the balcony and enjoying the view!"
18814170,194065295,2017-09-15,23938440,Melissa,"Excellent location for exploring Monterey area. 30 minutes from wine tasting in Carmel Valley, 60 minutes from epic Big Sur, 5 minute walk form gorgeous ocean side walking trail and shops / aquarium / restaurants. The place is cute, clean, has comfy beds, and a better view than the airbnb pics show! 
Host was quick to respond to questions and checkin was extremely simple, quick, and easy.
We would absolutely stay again."
18814170,195296049,2017-09-18,54808524,Aleksandr,A+ what a place!! Saw whales throughout the day from the living room and the cleanliness and kitchen utilities were spot on! Loved it.
18814170,196623409,2017-09-23,54927120,Wendy,Brand new condo that's model house perfect ! The ocean view the decor the location makes this stay a perfect 10. Driving north to Felton and visited the Roaring Camp Railroad and the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park was a lovely drive. Going down to Carmel and Pebble Beach and Big Sur was easy and pleasant. Make sure to check out Crema for coffee and brunch. Pavel's Bakeri for amazing bread and pastry. Dinner at Beach House at Lovers Point is phenomenal ! Looking forward to coming back to stay in the near future ~
18814170,198003305,2017-09-27,72897169,Ayesha,Perfection!!!

18814170,202083299,2017-10-09,64784457,Joel,This is a beautifully renovated home with some blue water views of the Monterey Bay.  It is walkable to the Aquarium or to the beach - about 20 minutes to either destination.  It's probably about the same distance to downtown Pacific Grove.  We highly recommend it!
18814170,203290876,2017-10-14,7075377,Tiffany,"Merry’s place is just wonderful! Modern, new, stylish decor, garage parking and good location.   We would rebook in a minute when back in the area!"
18814170,205810247,2017-10-22,4973410,Nishant,Merry's place in Pacific Grove was very clean and just what we hoped for. We had a great stay and would return!
18814170,208043340,2017-10-30,15078658,Rebecca,Brand new and spotlessly clean.  good location too.
18814170,216430031,2017-12-03,5068544,Ryan,"Checking in and out was easy, the place was really nice and clean, and the location was an easy walk to shops and restaurants."
18814170,219531395,2017-12-17,122156133,Ian,"Beautifully modern and clean home with plenty of amenities and a wonderful view of the ocean. If there are guests in the unit below be aware, you will be able to hear them walking around. Communication with the Property Manager could have been better but overall a wonderful place to stay."
18814170,223752054,2018-01-01,90120640,Cindy,"Our family of 5 had a very comfortable stay here for 2 nights.   It is a stylishly renovated, new and very clean flat. Merry is a great host. We appreciate her prompt and helpful replies to all our queries."
18814170,226254096,2018-01-09,16185574,Julie,"Merry's place looked new and pretty in the photos, but in person it is even better! It is truly lovely, with very comfortable furnishings and everything you could need for a gorgeous home away from home experience. The location is great, we loved the deck with the ocean views, and it's the perfect place to explore PG and Carmel from. We didn't want to leave! We were celebrating a special birthday and our mom was definitely ""Wowed"" by this place!"
18814170,226851514,2018-01-12,17711268,Hernan,"The apartment was perfect. Just like the pictures. Everything is new , near the beach, and close to restaurants."

Everything you need for your stay, even shampoo. Merry is an excellent host.  We cannot recommend it enough.  Top notch place.  Very quiet neighborhood and also very safe.  Walking distance to the main attractions and restaurants.  We had a terrific time. Great for families with children."
18814170,234150374,2018-02-11,34583857,Michelle,"Exactly as pictured, conveniently located. Super value and so much better than a hotel for a girls weekend!"
18814170,237652762,2018-02-23,13866235,Nilufeur,"Everything was as described. We (four adults and two kinds) spent a week at Merry's. We used the home as a base and did day trips to San Francisco, Big Sur and Carmel by the Sea. The Aquarium was walking distance away and there were lots of cafes and restaurants close by. The kitchen was well equipped for home cooking too! We spent evenings on the balcony sipping wine and looking at the fantastic view. The Dennis the Menace park is also worth a visit if you have little ones.
We will definitely be back!"
18814170,242378336,2018-03-11,31379271,Clare,"Stunning apartment with a lovely view of the ocean. All the mod cons and everything you could need in a kitchen; from coffee machine to great knives. The bathrooms were deluxe and felt like a posh hotel. The only bummer for us was the neighbours were quite loud at night so it wasn’t he most peaceful night’s sleep. But other than that, we had a lovely stay. Check-in was super easy and straightforward."
18814170,243661652,2018-03-16,65901648,Angie,"This was our best ever Air BnB.  Merry’s place was very nice, quiet and had all the amenities."
18814170,246562834,2018-03-25,39051597,Emily,"We had a wonderful visit in this fresh, clean, updated space. The bay view from living room and master bedroom was excellent. We were able to walk easily to the aquarium and to a market, restaurants, etc. in Pacific Grove.  The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and lovely.  Designated parking was very helpful. Merry was quick with a response when I had a question and made us feel right at home."
18814170,247788390,2018-03-29,119488073,Krista,"This was a great place to stay for four! Plenty of space, beautiful views, and walking distance to many fun places!"
18814170,249763723,2018-04-02,97290276,Marianne,En flott leilighet med meget godt kjøkken og fin sjøutsikt. Grei gangavstand til restauranter etc i Pacific Grove. Veldig bra å leie sykler og sykle til Pebble Beach langs sjøen. Flotte nærområder med bil; Carmel-by-the-sea og 17th Mile Drive.
18814170,250630261,2018-04-05,166833132,Kristin,"Beautiful house, great location!"
18814170,251914337,2018-04-08,1969701,Lynna,The property looked great in the photos but was so much better in person. We all wished our homes were designed the same way. The neighborhood was quiet and the view of the ocean was quite a sight to see in the morning. I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re visiting Monterey.
18814170,254132329,2018-04-15,4401243,Valarie,"All I can say is... Amazing. The place is spotless, recently updated, kitchen is bigger than it looks in the kitchen. Perfect for a family or a girls weekend. We walked to Cannery Row, coffee, lunch etc. Will definitely be back."

She even provides a guest pass into the 17 mile loop, which was wonderful.  I look forward to staying here again! "
18917071,157838920,2017-06-04,126616324,Cristina,"This cute little house was perfect for our trip, it was incredibly clean and cozy. The two parking spots was a huge plus. Great location with easy access to Trader Joe's as well as a few restaurants. Minutes away from Fisherman's Wharf. Carolyn provided us with various amenities. The board games were great since there wasn't any tv's. She was also very attentive and quickly responded to any concerns. "
18917071,168075393,2017-07-08,7787961,Colleen,It's a beautifully well stocked apartment across the street from grocery stores and little cafes. It was great!
18917071,168932624,2017-07-10,61472245,Benjamin,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay at Carolyn's place.  The place is clean, quiet and comfortable.  Having Trader Joe's right across the street is super convenient.  It is walkable to Cannery Row for good access to nightlife.  I would definitely stay here again!   "
18917071,171804396,2017-07-18,7497037,Susan,"Thanks to Carolyn and her lovely daughters, we have had a fantastic time in Pacific Grove. We arrived to a lovely welcome pack, lots of fluffy towels, an information folder full of ideas and a cosy clean place. Carolyn suggested lots of places to visit and  arranged for her daughters to take our teenage sons surfing plus providing us with beach chairs and a big bag of beach towels!
Spending 4 nights at Carolyn's place was the perfect ending to our holiday. Thanks so much Carolyn.
"
18917071,172756563,2017-07-21,39475662,Dave,Wonderful host! So much attention to details! Walking distance to lots of amenities and necessities. Felt very at home in this cozy warm cottage! Will stay longer next time. 
18917071,173653306,2017-07-23,37452155,Eddie,"This place is conveniently located near the geological center of Monterey peninsula so it's an easy drive to the freeway, Aquarium, the beaches, 17-miles drive, dinning places, or shopping centers. It has designated parking right next to the building. 

I think the most impressive about this place are 1) cleanness, 2) refrigerator stocked with tasty beers, 3) breakfast items, 4) comfy beds, 5) the 'Welcome' binder is very helpful, 6) books and games.

Really can't say enough about how satisfied and grateful we are with the experience."
18917071,175374075,2017-07-28,1002896,Emma,"I can't say enough good things about both Carolyn and her lovely place in Pacific Grove. I was an airbnb host for two years and have also been an airbnb guest in a number of different locations and genuinely feel that Carolyn is an exceptional hostess. She communicated very clearly and was warm, kind and helpful. She is incredibly attentive to detail, as well as generous and her place is immaculately clean and very comfortable, as well as good value. We only booked for a short time and were truly sorry to have to leave, as we felt very at home. We would definitely return and highly highly recommend."
18917071,178538100,2017-08-05,20402026,Dawn,"Carolyn's place is well stocked with everything you need to live, cook, and even do your laundry. There was beer in the fridge and wine coffee and other snacks on the counter. The laundry room was stocked with plenty of tide pods and Carolyn was super responsive and helpful. The place is right across the street from Trader Joe's, a gym, and plenty of shops and restaurants. A 30 minute walk will put you at Asilomar state park, beach and all. We loved our stay and would definitely rent the place again. The only thing we missed was a microwave."
18917071,179900843,2017-08-08,95633120,AmitRaj,"The home was neat and in a central location - close to carmel, aquarium, cannery row, beach and restaurants. Carolyn was very responsive and also offered us 2 passes to aquarium. I would definitely recommend this place to people who like to be in central location and cover everything that monterey bay area has to offer."
18917071,183623708,2017-08-17,122541154,Mitch,She was great and very helpful
18917071,186871826,2017-08-25,19812113,Michael,"Convenient spot that worked out well for a short business trip.  Fast communication with owner and property was clean and as depicted.  

Thanks!"
18917071,189443729,2017-09-01,59642221,Marketa,"I really enjoyed my stay at Carolyn's place. Very cozy, clean and a great location. Carolyn also provided lot of extras including a welcome basket, coffee pods, shampoo etc."
18917071,191017916,2017-09-05,37348529,Teresa,Extremely clean and well stocked condo in a great location close to grocery stores.
18917071,192108674,2017-09-09,15329425,Philippe,Le logement de Carolyn est très confortable et chaleureux. Il est situé à proximité de commerces et bien situé pour les visites. Carolyn met à dispositions toutes les informations nécessaires pour un séjour agréable. Son panier d'accueil très bien rempli. Tres bonne adresse.
18917071,195794393,2017-09-20,143282562,Tamara,"A nice little house, with a lovely host, good to stay in while you're visiting the pretty Pacific Grove/Monterey/Carmel area.

Bed is comfy, kitchen is well-stocked with welcome basket provided (only thing missing is a microwave!) and the living area is nice to relax in. 

You can see the sea from the front yard which is lovely- try to watch the sun set from there at least once if you can.

House is across from Trader Joe's, ATM and some other shops and restaurants which is handy.  There is a bus stop only a few mins walk away and it's about a half hour downhill walk to Monterey Aquarium (which is amazing!). 

With a combination of local Ubers, lifts, bus and walking I managed without a car, but it probably would be better with one. Home is probably more ideal for people travelling with someone and a car, but you can make it work without a car and solo.

All in all, it's a nice spot, Carolyn is very helpful and down to earth, and it's a well-kitted out house in a lovely part of the world."
18917071,197533043,2017-09-25,57177410,Lidia,"Carolyn was an amazing host! Check in and check out was very easy. The place is adorable and very clean. The best part is that the house is across the street from quaint eateries, Trader Joes, and a three minute drive to the beach."
18917071,202033253,2017-10-09,66181856,Lisa,"Carolyn's place is clean, full of light and very easy to settle in to. She is the perfect gracious and welcoming host and responds very quickly to messages. Five stars!"
18917071,202749622,2017-10-12,95943691,Jeff,The place was great. I love the cabin feel and Carolyn provides so many great ammentities for you. The welcome gift of wine and so many other things was just great. I really enjoyed staying there and will want to be there more now.
18917071,203862669,2017-10-15,31256254,Derek,"Carolyn is a true pro when it comes to renting her place. Upon arrival there was a binder with an overview of the house, local tips for things to do and places to eat, and a few passes to the aquarium! There was also a welcome basket with some toiletries and a beer in the fridge which made us feel right at home. The location was great and the size just right for a group of 4. There's plenty of businesses right around the house so you don't have to go far for anything you need, and the beach is a short drive away. Overall we loved our stay at Carolyn's place and look forward to visiting again!"
18917071,204758330,2017-10-19,95943691,Jeff,Her welcoming touches are the best! You have everything you need.
18917071,206953086,2017-10-27,19067165,Nathan,"Carolyn is a terrific hostess and the unit is extremely well supplied with every appliance that we needed. In case you forget your toothbrush, she had boxes of extra supplies in the hall closet and kitchen that included toothbrushes and many other items. It was nice to have a washer and dryer available...with laundry soap provided! This is a duplex unit with the back patio shared by the tenant next door. It worked well for the two of us as the unit is located about 1 mile from the aquarium on Cannery Row and Lover's Point in Pacific Grove."
18917071,210482784,2017-11-09,154395221,Jessica,Cute space with all of the comforts of home! Close to some of the best places in Paradise Cove. Carolyn goes above & beyond for her guests.
18917071,210923152,2017-11-11,7229583,Alyce,"Great location, near by monterey and Carmel. Size of place was actually smaller than expected. Carolyn response is awesome. Even provided us some pasta and wine! "
18917071,211650106,2017-11-13,13182468,Eun-Mee,"This cozy spot was a great place for a weekend getaway with a couple of friends! The place was clean. The kitchen had everything we needed. This place is located on a main road, but it was not an issue at all. It's inset, so you don't have to watch cars. It was pleasantly quiet inside, and at night, the road is quiet. The location also allowed for easy access to Monterey and Carmel."
18917071,212635180,2017-11-18,92684545,Luci,"It was a cute place close to the ocean. The owner was very helpful and even brought over some kids toys which my 4 year old LOVED. She stocked the place with coffee, beer, and wine and it was very cozy. She also let us use her aquarium passes which was a huge help. Would recommend this place."
18917071,214373582,2017-11-25,59925108,Cheryl,"The cozy charmer is a great value. Just the right size for what we needed, as we spent most of our time with family and seeing the sights. Luxurious bath towels and quality bed linens were appreciated. Nice warm touches like quilts and Longaberger baskets. Carolyn was very prompt in replying to accept our request to book and also when we had a question. Would absolutely consider her propert(ies) again."
18917071,216438070,2017-12-03,58587214,Adrian,Carolyn's place was just as advertised! I was attending the Asilomar math conference and her home was conveniently located close to the Asilomar Conference Grounds and Pacific Grove middle school.  Carolyn made check in and check out really easy! I would love to stay again in the future!
18917071,219521704,2017-12-17,18624371,Diane,"Great location, great local information given. House was well stocked with everything you could need. Very private and great parking."
18917071,220121884,2017-12-20,59642221,Marketa,"This was the second time I stayed at Carolyn's place and hope to stay there again. Very cozy, clean, comfortable and a great location!"
18917071,221764981,2017-12-27,3023604,Anoo,Carolyn has a well equipped home with neat touches — the coffee machine was a hit! She went out of her way to welcome us with a bottle of wine and a few other key perks!! She was super responsive and accommodating.
18917071,222439441,2017-12-29,1547005,Kris,"We really enjoyed our stay at Carolyn's place. Great space for our family of 3.  Full kitchen came in handy and location was great. Close enough to Cannery Row, but also far enough away from it! Pacific Grove is really nice!  We would definitely stay here again. "
18917071,225191137,2018-01-05,140775848,Stacey,"Clean, cozy place with everything we needed .... Carolyn responded quickly to any question we had... Cant wait to come back!"
18917071,229645607,2018-01-24,102783044,Mark,Carolyn's duplex was a great home base for two weeks in January while my wife and I took day trips to explore from Big Sur to the south to the coastal redwoods to the north.  The accommodations and amenities were exactly as described by previous reviewers. 
18917071,230260884,2018-01-27,3480393,Joanna,"Carolyn's place was perfect for my conference at Asilomar. I shared it with my coworker who used the 2nd bedroom. She nicely left out some food and drinks for my arrival, which were welcome after my 3 hour drive. 
The place is compact but well appointed and functional. I enjoyed the coffee she left and had that each morning before my meeting. The bed I used (main bedroom) was extremely comfortable, which was wonderful (a good bed makes all the difference) and I slept very well each night. It was a good location- a 20 minute walk to Asilomar, though I drove because I was staying there late at night. There were places for both me and my coworker to park, and the location can't be beat for convenience to some stores and restaurants. Everything was perfect and cozy. My only wish was that my son and husband could have come with me and visited the area while I was working- there was room for them both- but alas, they were in school! I highly recommend for visiting the area. Carolyn was highly responsive and the place was nice and clean, and quiet."
18917071,232859385,2018-02-06,97432533,Monty,"We had such an enjoyable time at Carolyn's place. We can clearly see her thoughtfulness in almost everything in the house. Nice and smart decoration. The location is very good too. Safeway and Trader Joe's right across the street, very easy for us to buy grocery and cook. The dryer and washer are brand new. Detergent, salt, utensils, wine, pasta, pepper, tea, coffee, toothpaste, shampoo, etc. are all there for us to use. I am surprised at how thoughtful Carolyn was."
18917071,234146669,2018-02-11,99798641,Blake,Awesome Home. Great host.
18917071,235184089,2018-02-15,171221309,Sang-Gyou,"Carolyn made our visit to Monterey and Carmel just amazing with the wonderful accommodation at a very generous price! She left us lovely amenities and tips for the trip which made it really easy to enjoy the area. Her duplex is centrally located to visit both Monterey, Carmel, and Big Sur. We would definitely consider staying with her again on our next visit. 

The duplex was really clean and comfortable. It was within walking distance from Trader Joes/Safeway. We could also walk to Bagel Kitchen for some delicious breakfast bagel sandwiches and coffee."
18917071,236667936,2018-02-19,28576782,Tess,Great space! Carolyn was super accessible throughout the trip whenever we had any questions. Lovely kitchen. Thank you for making our stay in Monterey incredibly easy and comfortable.
18917071,239425455,2018-03-01,611126,Lawrence,"This place was petite, but centrally located between Monterrey, Camel, 17 mile drive, convenient for grocery shopping also.  Much of the furnishings appeared new. There was a great welcome basket waiting for us that was most generous. But the best part was the host. We've stayed with airbnb all around the world, and Carolyn was the best host we ever had. She surprised us with a few extra goodies that saved us quite a few dollars and made our visit much better."
18917071,240463991,2018-03-04,72398605,Lewis,"Carolyn's place was  as advertised. It's not in the heart of Pacific Grove, but it's close to Trader Joe's and other amenities you might appreciate. She left a lovely welcome basket with wine, etc, and communications were easy and clear."
18917071,241331318,2018-03-08,167445971,Kathy,"Cozy space, clean, well equipped kitchen"
18917071,242378661,2018-03-11,35916358,Abhishek,We spent 2 nights here and had one of the best Airbnb experiences so far. Carolyn is great to work with and really accommodative. The place is better than the pics and right across trader Joe's and safeway and Starbucks is less than a block away. The welcome basket was great and small things that Carolyn has done to the place added to the overall convenience. We would definitely re-book this is revisiting Pacific Grove in the future!
18917071,243674419,2018-03-16,22806296,Liz,"My daughter and I rented Carolyns place and absolutely loved it. The house was very clean and well appointed. She was quick to respond to any questions that we had. There was even a welcome box on our arrival with oatmeal, coffee, pasta and popcorn. It was close to pacific grove down town and across the street from Trader Joes.  We love to cook and found the kitchen to have everything we needed to make a great meal!"
18917071,244881025,2018-03-19,22493496,Daisy And Tom,Great place to stay in Monterey. Easy drive to everything. Lovely little patio to soak up the sun. Comfortable rooms and good kitchen. We also loved the welcome treats - thanks Carolyn!! Lots of good local tips aswell and Carolyn was easily contactable anytime we needed.
18917071,247518763,2018-03-28,27021669,Cheryl,"My two photography friends and I really enjoyed our stay at Carolyn's. The beds were very comfortable and we enjoyed going to the bagel place across the street for breakfast. The kitchen was well stocked so we did eat a few meals ""At home."" I'd love to stay there again."
18917071,249155568,2018-04-01,165030489,Hana,We really enjoyed staying at Carolyn's place. It was a nice space for our family to stay with grocery stores within walking distance. We really appreciated Carolyn's hospitality and kindness during our stay.
18917071,250335894,2018-04-04,103887490,Grant,"This small but well-kept property was a great place for my family to stay on a quick vacation to the Monterey area. Carolyn is a great, responsive host, and I felt like we were well taken care of. The place is close to Monterey, Carmel, 17-Mike Drive, and a number of great beaches. It’s also across the street from a couple of shopping centers with groceries and quick eats. Definitely a good spot for a small family on a coastal vacation."
18917071,251349861,2018-04-07,8121140,Queena,"The accommodations were as described, place has an unexpected rustic charm and we enjoyed our stay there. The place is off a main highway - fyi - but Pacific Grove is a sleepy town so it quiets down early. On flipside, there’s a Trader Joe’s across the street, which is super convenient if you have kids, and it’s centrally located to all the sights!"
18917071,252243413,2018-04-09,3181134,Dave,"We had a wonderful stay at Carolyn's home in Pacific Grove. She was very accommodating and quick to respond to questions. She even provided some toys for the kids :) The house is close to groceries, and a quick drive down to Cannery Row, the Wharf, and Aquarium. Thanks for hosting us Carolyn! We'll be back again next time we're looking for a place to stay near Monterey."
18917071,254033595,2018-04-15,18719526,Ross,"Awesome location, easy check in, gift basket waiting for you :)"
19053738,162169719,2017-06-19,6605970,Kay,"I got quite sick at the last minute and had to cancel.  I called Rhonda on the off-chance that we could work something out so maybe I wouldn't have to forfeit  all of the $488 dollars I'd paid.  Since I had signed a no-refund agreement, I expected to be pretty much slammed.  Much to my amazement, Rhonda was willing to work with me.  Not only that: she spent three hours of her time figuring the situation out with Airbnb.  Result: a conference call between her, me, and a great Airbnb representative--and a full refund from Rhonda and Airbnb!  Not only that: throughout Rhonda was concerned and solicitous about my condition.  I could not believe how kind she was to a perfect stranger, especially one who was causing her all kinds of time and trouble.   Rhonda, thank you more than I can say for your kindness and your humanity.  I hope your company knows what a jewel they have in you.   Even though I didn't see the apartment, I gave it five stars because I know that with someone of your caliber, it's immaculate.   I can't wait to meet you!   "
19053738,163969496,2017-06-25,133023947,Makenzie,"Great value, super cute & convenient, owners are sweet and helpful! Close to everything you would want to do in Monterey, but still quiet. Perfect vacation stay.

19053738,166546259,2017-07-03,105157987,Katie,"The whole process of booking, communication about the rental, picking up keys, etc was seamless.  The apartment is cozy and feels like a beachy home-away-from home.  The bed is super comfortable and we found all amenities we needed for our vacation. Highly recommended!"

19053738,172073790,2017-07-19,33388915,Colin,"Really nice place. Quiet residential neighborhood, but still close to lots of things you'd like to be near (e.g. Aquarium, Asilomar conference center).

Thanks for the great stay!"
19053738,174101953,2017-07-24,11303931,Maria,"A lovely one bedroom apartment conveniently located between Pacific Grove and Monterey. It's about a 5-7minute walk from the beach and walking distance to either downtown Pacific Grove or cannery row in Monterey, making it easy to access shops and restaurants. We also found the Nob Hill nearby (~12min walk) very handy. Rhonda was a great host, easily accessible and available for questions at all times. Highly recommended and hope I can come back soon!"
19053738,175393656,2017-07-28,74815104,Nick,This place was great!! Such a perfect location close to everything you can ask for. Very cozy and comfy and for a great price. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in the area. 
19053738,176820662,2017-07-31,51742413,Paul & Tami,The property is located in such a wonderful location...centrally located in Pacific Grove and in walking distance to downtown shopping and plenty of views of the ocean! The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed! I loved relaxing on the comfy couch with access to cable tv. Loved the cozy beach decorations throughout the home! Can't wait to stay here again in the future!
19053738,182056650,2017-08-13,7200989,Hailey,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance to the aquarium and Cannery Row. Rhonda was extremely helpful and took care of all of our needs.  Thank you so much for a wonderful time!"

I would highly recommend."
19053738,195545510,2017-09-19,1854010,Thomas,"It was a very nice stay at the cozy appartment in Pacific Grove. It is situated very closed to the lighthouse avenue where you can find a lot of nice little shops and very good restaurants. The Pacific Ocean is also not far away. The area is quiet and safe. Parking the car on the street wasn't a problem and there is also a parking lot for guest on the property. It is only a short drive to many sights in the Monterey area (e.g. Monterey Bay Aquarium, Fisherman's Wharf or Cannery Row).

The appartment was equipped with everything thing we needed for our purposes and we loved to cook in the kitchen at the evening. As we arrived the table in the living room was already nicely decorated.

Check-in for the appartment at the office was very easy and check-out was also uncomplicated.

If we come back to Monterey, and I hope we will come back as soon as possible, this appartment will be our first choice."
19053738,196294391,2017-09-22,111665943,Pete And Sue,Great location. Very comfortable. A couple of minor problems were instantly resolved. We would definitely stay there again.

We especially appreciated the cable tv, good wifi, allocated parking and laundry facilities. The location was convenient to explore Pacific Grove and Monterey and is minutes away from loads of great restaurants and the beach."
19053738,198846783,2017-09-30,27574916,Siân,"A very comfortable and clean apartment in a great location for walking to Monterey Aquarium and Cannery Row. We also walked to Lovers Point and back through Pacific Grove (which is lovely and has tons of great cafes).
This AirBnB has a really well equipped kitchen but is also within walking distance of some great restaurants.
Key pick up was easy and Rhonda was super helpful when we couldn't work out how to get into the laundry.
We would highly recommend for a trip to Monterey."
19053738,200267298,2017-10-04,117055501,Joyce,"Charming little house with a nice, flowered backyard to have morning coffee in.  The furnishings were quite pleasant, and the location was in a nice, quiet neighborhood within walking distance of a coastal path (but not easy beach access).   Parking was good too."
19053738,204373735,2017-10-17,99275348,Mark,Great place. Was just as pictured and described.

19053738,208037574,2017-10-30,11977201,Jan,"This place is so very lovely!  Quiet neighborhood.  Walking distance to so much.  Centrally located to driving to Asilomar, Monterey, Carmel, Pebble Beach & Big Sur.  Close to a Safeway, Trader Joe's, gas stations, reataurants.  We ate at Gianni's Pizza and had wonderful clam chowder at Vivolli's, both in Pacific Grove.  Quiet sitting area in the garden right outside bedroom door.  The bathtub was large enough to have a long soak after a day of sightseeing.  The bed has a very comfy mattress.  Having access to laundry right in the garage was wonderful.  Parking right in the driveway is a huge plus.  We can't wait to return.  Highly recommend this place!"
19053738,219767130,2017-12-18,5904796,Julie,The house is comfortable---bed is great and loved the garden. Location is wonderful for walking the shoreline or visiting the Aquarium. We would stay again.
19053738,234170465,2018-02-11,76360375,Janet,"Often you see a deal and assume it can't be as good as it looks.  In our case, a beautiful one bedroom apartment three blocks from our daughter's home, with private garden, a short walk to the ocean and great places to eat .  It could not have been better !   We plan on coming back as often as we can.  Highly recommend !!!"
19053738,237138777,2018-02-21,23501433,Toka,This is an excellent location for visiting the acquarium and Cannery Row—a short walk although somewhat hilly. The living area is especially comfy with good reading light. And the off street parking is a special plus!
19053738,239950224,2018-03-03,7227136,Alan,"This apartment was very well-equipped, comfortable, and convenient.  All the arrangements were handled with consideration and efficiency.  We would love to return."

19137340,162655629,2017-06-21,73260563,Cynthia,"The house itself was very nice, clean and new. Host has got a good taste in decoration and home style that you will notice and enjoy for the stay(love the mattress, cushions, room spray, painting, coffee and more). The location is perfect!!! Minutes walk to restaurants, minutes drive to the beach, 17mile drive... the neighborhood is quite pretty as well. Chris is so helpful and kind. I just cannot thank him more. I couldn't find anything to complain even if I tried. Please try Chris's place if you want to stay in Monterey, and you won't be disappointed."
19137340,163918054,2017-06-25,42853266,Ellen,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at Chris' home in Pacific Grove! The newly remodeled home is very well furnished and designed. Everything was very clean and welcoming, making our stay so enjoyable.  We cooked at the house, and it was so easy with quality cutlery and cookware. Chris is a gracious host and we'd recommend a stay at his AirBnb for anyone looking to visit the area! "
19137340,166220687,2017-07-03,24166547,Stephanie,"Our stay at Chris's place was great! I only wish we could have stayed longer. The house is beautiful and in a terrific location, walking distance from the restaurants and shops in Pacific Grove and very close to the scenic coastline. Chris was very helpful answering questions about the local area and setting us up for our stay. "
19137340,167180228,2017-07-05,43358229,Erika,This place is adorable. The decorations and charm are great. The location is perfect for a walk downtown or to the beach. My little family walked to the Monterey aquarium and back(25-30min walk there). We would definitely visit again if we are in the area. 
19137340,171096468,2017-07-16,134919521,Patrick,"Large, Quiet, Spotless, well appointed home with all the amenities
(wash/dry/iron/blow dryer/cooking etc etc)
COMFORTABLE BEDS!!
Great central location, 15 min walk to aquarium, 10 min drive to Carmel,
10 minute walk to beach, and, town of Pacific Grove just a couple of blocks.
Chris is a gracious host
"
19137340,181982061,2017-08-13,216322,Lucy,"Chris has an absolutely beautiful place - it's newly renovated to a very high standard. Really well equipped - he has thought of everything you could need, and was welcoming and easy to reach and happy to give recommendations / answer questions. Pacific Grove is a quieter alternative to Monterey or Carmel by the Sea, but within  easy reach of both. Highly recommend staying at Chris' place."
19137340,190625213,2017-09-04,9019577,Mary,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay here for Labor Day weekend. The house was spotless and had all the amenities you would find in a hotel. Chris was a great host and gave us a tour of the house upon check-in. It was an especially hot weekend and he even tried to buy us fans, but they were all sold out. The location was perfect--walking distance to downtown and a 5 min drive to the aquarium and beach. We would definitely stay here again the next time we're in the area."
19137340,193218977,2017-09-12,136639490,湘,Lovely house. We had a good time there. It's really clean and Chris is a very sweet guy. I will recommend to people who are looking for a place to stay in Monterey
19137340,195306615,2017-09-18,121879786,Gustav,The perfect familystay with great location between Monterey and Pebble Beach!Chris is such a nice host and the house was fantastic. We stayed for five days and had a wonderful time. My recommendations! Hope to come back!
19137340,199316629,2017-10-01,118988919,Eric,"Great space, great host, and great location! Chris was a great host, and the house is exactly as advertised. I highly recommend this listing when visiting Monterey!"
19137340,202047352,2017-10-09,48416198,Colleen,"We had a wonderful weekend at Chris's house!!  The house was spotless and had all the amenities we could ask for.  I especially loved the charm of the house and how new everything was.  The minute we arrived we felt right at home.  Chris even came by one morning with fresh muffins for us, which was a lovely gesture.  The location was perfect.  You could walk to town and restaurants as well as the beach.  Chris's was the perfect host.  He was responsive to any questions and helpful with his knowledge of the area.  Can't wait to return, but this time for a longer stay."
19137340,202517002,2017-10-11,55524325,Xue,Really great house
19137340,211666613,2017-11-13,35330471,Annabelle,We had such a wondeful time at Chris's place! We arrived later in the evening than we expected and Chris made the check in so smooth and made us feel super welcome. The house was even more beautiful than we expected! There were even games for us to play. The location was great and Chris was a fantastic host!
19137340,227716701,2018-01-15,166506690,Anthony,Chris was an amazing host and was very helpful.  The house is probably the most immaculate home we have ever stayed in.  Thanks Chris!
19137340,237366702,2018-02-22,18568822,Marie,"Our whole experience with staying at Chris' place was great. The listing is clear and accurate, and communication with Chris was quick and easy.
The house is lovely and immaculately clean, the kitchen is well stocked with pots & pans, anything you might reach for when putting together a quick meal.
We enjoyed a rousing game of Ticket to Ride and loved being in a quiet neighborhood while still having easy and quick access to the nearest Trader Joe's, the Aquarium, and Pacific Grove.
The house has clearly been recently remodeled, everything was shiny and new, the master bed is firm, side sleepers may need extra time to adapt!
Chris was accessible and friendly and did a great job of making us feel welcome."
19137340,242691121,2018-03-12,83163669,Andrea,Chris’s place was immaculate and clean. The house was great and had everything we could think of and more. The attention to detail was spot on. We arrived to some nice wine and Chris was so thoughtful to drop off muffins the next morning. He made us feel right at home. We really enjoyed our stay at Chris’s and appreciated his local tips. I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in the area.
19137340,247794390,2018-03-29,52533956,Natalie,"Immaculate, cozy, and comfortable, this house is easy walking distance to Lighthouse Ave. and Lover's Point.  Chris was a communicative and gracious host, and we enjoyed our stay."
19179883,162429089,2017-06-20,27444425,Sarah,"This is a newly redone duplex, we occupied the lower floor of two. It has two full bedrooms, one with twin beds, two bathrooms, and a large open concept kitchen into dining room into living area with full pull out couch. The entire house is spotless, decorated in tasteful soothing tones. A large deck allows you to sit outside or bbq and see the ocean in the distance as well as get great breezes and sun. You can park in the garage or driveway.  Access was easy. Getting into town was merely a few minutes drive. We stayed here as a family of 5 grown people and had plenty of room. We asked for later check out and Merry kindly accomodated us. I would love to stay here again! "
19179883,163161231,2017-06-23,52774612,Pol,"It is a very cozy apartment, completeley clean and looks like new. In a nice neighborhood near to the sea. The best option to visit Monterey and stay in the best place!

19179883,168636587,2017-07-09,32578300,Tim,Great place to spend time. The unit was very clean and comfortable. 
19179883,169799681,2017-07-13,117575279,Tim,Best accommodations on our entire trip of a dozen 2 bedroom units. 1st class in every way.
19179883,173683571,2017-07-23,137187793,Brian,Very good place for a small group. Took full advantage of a very nice deck/outside setup.
19179883,175031676,2017-07-27,140088984,Paul,"This flat is VERY nice, newly renovated, and an easy drive to Pacific Grove restaurants, Asilomar Beach, and downtown. It's a great alternative to the touristy hubbub of Carmel and Monterey.  The unit itself is newly (and very nicely) renovated, with a great kitchen, large TVs, comfortable beds, etc.  Merry, out host, was great (including quickly letting us know one of our guests had left behind On my way! Clothing...and arranging a way for us to get it back). Highly recommended!"
19179883,176425316,2017-07-30,24947372,Kristin,"Merry's place is great. Very clean, bright, modern decor that makes the perfect, efficient use of the space.  Great outdoor deck, all the comforts and amenities you would ever need - quality linens, well equipped kitchen etc.  And of course, a fabulous location in a quiet neighborhood that is a short walk to the downtown area and ocean front paths.  We loved our stay here."
19179883,178509764,2017-08-05,80129458,Paul,What a great place and location. It had everything we we looking for on our vacation. Location is terrific - short walk to aquarium and Cannery Row and easy access to everything the Monterey area has to offer. Everything in the apartment is brand new and extremely clean.
19179883,179905619,2017-08-08,18455618,Jiahu,"Love Merry's Apt! This Apt is clean, beatiful and convenient. We had 2 great nights here!"
19179883,182018356,2017-08-13,46467185,Samantha,"What a great little spot! We had a wonderful weekend here. The finishes at the apartment were GORGEOUS! Looks even better in person than the pictures. The patio is huge, and nice to sit out and enjoy the view of the ocean. Beds were comfy and the bathrooms were really nice. We had a great time, and cant wait to come back!"
19179883,187891266,2017-08-27,129438170,Charlotte,"Merry's place was fantastic. The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood overlooking the water and close to all the key attractions in Monterey and Pacific Grove. The apartment has a great layout, is beautifully decorated, and has a full kitchen with all the cooking tools we needed. Merry was very responsive via text/email and made our stay very easy and comfortable. We would love to stay again in the future!"
19179883,190696727,2017-09-04,929321,Olivia,"Merry’s place was absolutely beautiful! It had just been redone, and the decor was truly delightful. The check-in process is super smooth, and the use of door codes is incredibly convenient (no more fear of lost keys.) The location is perfect. 

The only caveat (and it’s not Merry’s fault in any way) is that sound transmits from the upstairs unit all too well. The family staying above us had several small children who spent much of their time running from one side of the unit to the other and jumping up and down for HOURS, throughout our stay. 

Our pleas for quiet were disregarded, and unfortunately so were Merry’s. She very kindly and promptly contacted these people, and though the jumping did stop, the running did not. Imagine having a herd of little elephants stomping above your head... 

As said, this was the only drawback. Everything else about Merry’s apartment was pristine!"
19179883,192640174,2017-09-10,46425688,Brett,"Merry helped us in a jam on our Honeymoon! Her place was incredible, spacious, and clean. Extremely close to everything we needed!"
19179883,194911429,2017-09-17,66638974,William,"This is a beautifully furnished. recently remodeled condo with a fully stocked kitchen, located a short distance from everything (short car trips) with easy street or driveway parking. We stayed for five days and enjoyed our time in Pacific Grove immensely. A great, quiet home away from home in a peaceful residential neighborhood. Can sleep six, but is terrific for a couple with or without children. We would definitely return."
19179883,196602644,2017-09-23,40709018,Jordan,"This apartment is pretty perfect! Great location within a short walk to Lovers Point. The home is lovely - super-clean and very well-appointed. Comfy beds. Includes a great deck with a grill, laundry on premises, garage parking (with ample street parking as well). Seamless access with electronic, coded locks is a huge plus. My family and I had a great time here, and would definitely recommend it and stay again.  

Merry was a very polite and responsive host.  The booking and check-in process worked efficiently and was a very pleasant experince."
19179883,199377835,2017-10-01,38978554,Scott,"Great place for a weekend away.  Plenty of space + fantastic bonus of back deck with eating area, chairs and a nice grill (natural gas).  Nice to have a garage as well.  Everything inside was quite new and in great condition. This was our home base for a golf trip and, where we were within ~15-20 minutes of almost anywhere we wanted to go (Spyglass, Spanish Bay, Pebble, Poppy Hills, Bayonet/Blackhorse, etc).  Grocery stores, restaurants, etc all within a good distance as well."
19179883,202072616,2017-10-09,132125607,Daniel,"Great, clear communication. Everything was very comfortable and clean! The kitchen is well stocked with various utensils, plates, serving platters, and drink ware.  We would highly recommend staying here!"

19179883,207754080,2017-10-29,29589499,Melissa,"Great stay at this beautiful house! Lots of room for the four of us in the house and extra room on the large deck. The house was nicely decorated, well stocked with kitchen supplies and extraordinary clean!! Loved that there are 2 bathrooms. Located in a residential neighborhood, a few blocks from the ocean. We had a wonderful time and will rent this house again, if ever in the area. Thanks!"
19179883,209696624,2017-11-05,943085,Joy And Nev,"Quite easily the BEST Airbnb we've ever stayed at. Great location, value and amenities.

The place is immaculately clean and well stocked (even had a collapsable baby crib!)."
19179883,210147114,2017-11-07,9758352,Adelaide,Beautiful home. I highly recommend this rental. The location was perfect. It was about a 14 min walk down to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and about 20 min to Lovers Point Beach. You can see the bay from the living room window and also from the outdoor patio which has a barbeque grill with outdoor furniture. We loved watching hummingbirds in the morning from the window. The beds were super comfortable. Lots of natural light. I would love to stay here again if I'm in the area in the future.
19179883,211387937,2017-11-12,24302872,Andrew,Merry's place was very clean and well taken care of.  If traveling with kids just be aware that the location is on a fairly busy street. Other then that the stay was great.
19179883,214385022,2017-11-25,4526038,Bobby,Great place. My wife and kids stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday and we were really happy with everything. Merry is great to work with and was very responsive to all my questions. The place was incredibly clean with seemingly new furniture and had everything we needed for the long weekend. It's also just a few blocks from the Aquarium. We hope to stay there again next time we visit.
19179883,222077261,2017-12-28,85987905,Alexa,Great stay for 2 couples. Everything was perfect and clean and stocked with anything you could need. Beautiful inside and out on deck. Close to everything.
19179883,225188619,2018-01-05,53450732,Matthew,This place was fantastic. We had a group of 5 and and made use of the pull out couch as well. The house was just like the photos and was extremely cute and clean. We had all the amenities we needed. It’s about a 15 min walk to Cannery Row and the aquarium which was great for our group. This home was very comfortable and we really enjoyed staying here. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place in Monterey!
19179883,227723789,2018-01-15,4056978,Eric,Nice place!

19179883,236658396,2018-02-19,47652798,Melissa,"We had the best time at Merry’s home!  It is gorgeous, incredibly clean, recently remodeled, and very comfortable!  I also loved that there wasn’t any clutter, and nothing we had to childproof for our toddlers.  The location was perfect.

I will warn that we could hear every step from the upstairs neighbors.  Other than that, this was one of the nicest AirBnBs we’ve stayed in."
19179883,238758795,2018-02-26,609781,Lauren,"This home is BEAUTIFUL!  The communication with Merry was fantastic.  The view from the home was more than I expected.  The updates were tasteful and the amenities exceeded my expectation.  The only constructive feedback I would provide is that the upstairs was very noisy... there were several different tenants upstairs during my stay, and each was quite loud (I had little ones sleeping during our stay). Next time, I would probably try to book the upstairs unit... although, the grill downstairs was very appreciated.  Thanks Merry!!"
19179883,240364971,2018-03-04,48988043,Julia,"Very beautiful, clean location. Extremely comfortable for me and my family. Thanks!"

19179883,246559449,2018-03-25,7837960,Laura,"This was the nicest airbnb we've ever stayed in. We absolutely LOVED everything about it -- from the quaint seaside residential location to the gorgeous remodeled interior to the spacious deck. Everything is brand new, clean and modern. We were blown away by how immaculate it was! The kitchen was well-appointed and has everything you need. Each bedroom had super comfortable beds, a large walk-in closet and spacious modern bathrooms. Communication with Merry was great and check-in was a breeze. We had a wonderful stay and can't wait to return!"
19179883,250317084,2018-04-04,37728386,Diane,Merry is a wonderful host and the rental is superb.  The condo is clean and everything was updated.  Many plugs for computers and such.  Nice view from the windows.  Super quiet.  I highly recommend it.
19179883,250966003,2018-04-06,46316243,Jeffrey,Just as advertised. My family and I loved it.  We were able to walk to the aquarium which was great.

19179883,254060629,2018-04-15,104384508,Molly,"Merry's place is beautifully renovated and decorated, very well-maintained and super clean.  It felt even nicer than we expected after seeing the photos in the listing.  We stayed for 2 nights with our young children, and all of us were really happy and comfortable in the space.  Merry was quick and helpful in responding to the couple of messages I sent her during our stay.  The location was also great for the places we visited: the aquarium (5 min drive, or even walkable for adults & older kids), Asilomar Beach and Carmel (each ~10 min drive).  The Monterey Bay Coastal Trail is very close too - just a few blocks down the hill - and beautiful for running, walking or biking."
19181667,161908536,2017-06-18,13030171,Sonia,"Great location, good communication, cute little home."
19181667,163984812,2017-06-25,19997488,Dunja,Such a cute cottage! And very well furnished and equipped.

19181667,166858474,2017-07-04,2648695,Bella,"Joy is a very friendly host, easy to reach by phone and helpful.
She allowed us co check in and check out using additional hours to stay.
The house is clean, the beds are very comfortable.
The china , silverware and kitchenware are clean and new,
but the kitchen could be more modern: old cabinets,  no stuff to use oven.
There was a problem with electricity in the kitchen when we came, but it was fixed shortly."
19181667,168935921,2017-07-10,55825736,Onur,Good place. We were happy with it. The bathroom needs update. Other than that we were content...
19181667,170510438,2017-07-15,25302198,W Douglas,Great location and quiet   needs a bit of updating
19181667,172378543,2017-07-20,2413035,Andrea,"Very comfortable place to stay in a great location. The bed was comfortable with nice, soft sheets. Just a one block walk to shops, restaurants, and the ocean. Just a 5 minute drive to the aquarium, you could even walk it if you wanted to. We didn't use the kitchen too much, but it was well stocked with everything you would need to make a meal. The host was very responsive and check in and check out was super easy. We would stay here again on our next trip to the area."
19181667,173727268,2017-07-23,35142537,Jodi,Wonderful stay in a beautiful home
19181667,176800773,2017-07-31,4624711,Sine,Joy's place was a great value. Very clean and comfortable. Joy was easy to communicate with and the location of the house is excellent. Very close to all the things. We enjoyed our stay!

19181667,178556771,2017-08-05,105382973,Chris,Cute little house with everything you need for a comfy stay. Right around the corner from downtown. Lots of amazing restaurants and shops blocks away. Ended up not moving my car until we'd checked out.
19181667,179088039,2017-08-06,27297902,Christine,"Stayed for one night at Laurel Cottage. The house is in a central location, just a block away from the main street (Lighthouse Avenue) with all of the shops and restaurants. Joy was very quick to reply back to all messages, which I really appreciated. No particular issues with my stay, however, I did feel a little uncomfortable seeing picket signs on the yards directly across the street that said something along the lines of ""Keep Neighbors in Our Neighborhood and STRs (Short-term Rentals) Out"". The neighbors had their front door opened during most of the day while they were home but didn't seem very friendly."
19181667,180241370,2017-08-10,22591907,Tiffany,"Great location, lovely accommodations, helpful and kind host!"
19181667,180561824,2017-08-10,129902350,Christopher,"Cute cottage with essential holiday amenities & a great, central location."
19181667,182090845,2017-08-13,37510754,Sue,"Cute cottage in a lovely location. Walk to shops and restaurants and in an area full of gorgeous cottages and houses. Walking around the streets was a delight.
The cottage is small, but met our needs. The bathroom is very basic with a quite antiquated shower over bath but we were only there for 1 night so not an issue."
19181667,183268383,2017-08-16,96087030,Nicole,"Joy was a great host, making herself available to us ahead of time and even providing a pack n' play for us. The place was small and somewhat dated (mostly the kitchen and bathroom), but lovely. It worked well for our little family of four to have the two separate bedrooms. Our only complaint was that it got quite loud at times - at night with folks presumably leaving the bars and the garbage trucks in the early morning. Other than that, though, it was a great little spot and super convenient to the main PG drag and easy drive anywhere else on the peninsula."
19181667,185504147,2017-08-21,22219700,Clarissa,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying at Joy's place for Monterey Car Week. The house sits within walking distance to shops, restaurants, grocery stores and the beautiful beach in Pacific Grove. We'd love to stay here if we are ever back in town."
19181667,189748811,2017-09-02,135937710,Ang,Great place! Nice place to rent
19181667,191241403,2017-09-06,67831029,Tim,"This is a very conveniently located home in Pacific Grove, but it lacks modern amenities."
19181667,192663183,2017-09-10,28704338,Allison,"Cute cottage style house. King sized bed in one room, queen in be other. The bathtub/shower is tiiiiiny with a large step out, and those with mobility issues this isn't the bathroom for you. Expensive, but everything in this area is, so it's expected."
19181667,194056534,2017-09-15,78455955,Marcia,Great location-close to great restaurants. Good parking off street. If you enjoy clean environments this is not the place for you.
19181667,194346810,2017-09-16,10538378,Stephan,"Joys place was great, cozy, comfortable and very convenient. We wished we could have stayed longer!"
19181667,194920665,2017-09-17,30241960,Darci,"Good communication.

Sweet Victorian cottage in a precious neighborhood close to shops and nice walk to the ocean! A huge plus!!

"
19181667,195302365,2017-09-18,9769465,Natasha,"Stayed here for one night because of an event at CSU. Wish I stayed longer! Location is great, close to lots of restaurants and the beach. The house was adorable, clean, and the beds were so comfortable. Check in/out was a breeze. Highly recommended."

For 3 of us it was a gorgeous space, in a quiet neighbourhood"

19181667,205727256,2017-10-22,2059055,Nell,Joy’s place is in a great location - just a block from tons of restaurants and shops.

19181667,214355286,2017-11-25,123819977,Hannah,We had a wonderful stay at Joy's lovely place.  She was very responsive to our questions about the area. What a wonderful location! Only a few minutes walk to the coast and restaurants and shops literally a block from the house. The kitchen is fully functional and the whole place is cosy and quirky. Thanks for a wonderful stay!
19181667,214899417,2017-11-26,82708072,Donna,"Excellent Location...Overpriced for amenities. Walking distance to everything.
Condition of cottage was lacking. No TV, Dining area to accommodate only 2 people. Needed some TLC"
19181667,218022907,2017-12-10,107281735,Frank,Very small and rustic feel. Good location.
19181667,221788825,2017-12-27,34142037,Joe,"Joy, for the price you charge, the place was unsatisfactory.  For any price rather.  

It was not clean, had a pretty bad odor and the shower offered no soap other than a hairy, used bar.  How do you expect a guest to enjoy a place like this?  I suggest having your carpets removed or thoroughly cleaned as well as your pillows replaced."
19181667,227403511,2018-01-14,60378090,My,The place was cozy and clean. Check-in and communication were easy because Joy is very responsive. The location is super nice. It's walking distance to restaurants and the beach. We left a bag behind unintentionally and Joy called it to our attention to come back to retrieve it.
19181667,234173899,2018-02-11,1529291,Kim,"Joy was very easy to communicate with, she sent quick replies to questions and allowed us to drop our bags early."
19181667,236576860,2018-02-19,172003649,Courtney,"Joy welcomed us with open arms! She provided us with great recommendations for local activities and restaurants, and was a prime location to spots like Big Sur and Monterey nearby. She was also very accessible when we had questions during our stay. Love the artsy touches to the place :) Will definitely stay with her the next time we’re up in Pacific Grove!"
19181667,242317750,2018-03-11,10417834,Tanya,"My two friends and I had a great time staying at Joy's for the weekend. We were able to explore Carmel, Pacific Grove and other surrounding areas. It's a great location and has a very lovely historic cottage vibe. We love the tile in the kitchen and the old style bathtub! There are adorable local organic coffee shops within a 3 minute walk and the beach is just 10 mins walk away. Thank you Joy!"
19181667,245542289,2018-03-22,12770934,Jessica,Such an adorable cottage with excellent walking distance to shops and restaurants - highly recommend !!!

Tub/shower is tall and a little challenging to step in and out of."
19181667,251908630,2018-04-08,36521801,Sydney,"Joy's place was not only beautiful but in an incredible location! It is just a short walk from great restaurants, shops, and amazing views. Joy's house has a lot of charm and we really enjoyed getting to stay in such a well maintained historic house. Joy was quick to respond to any questions we had and provided wonderful restaurant recommendations. I would recommend Joy's place to anyone visiting the Monterey, CA area."
19181667,254109755,2018-04-15,13483,Steve,Great classic home. Very cute. No TV. Great location. Walk to beach & breakfast. Great host with generous tips on outings. We loved it.
19181667,255189362,2018-04-19,6887989,Jasmine,"This little town of Pacific Grove is a gem, so many cute little cottages and it was fun to stay in one. The location is super handy to the town and it’s a very cute space. The beds and linen are lovely. Kitchen and bathroom very small. Our main issues were wifi kept cutting in and out and only really worked in the bedroom where the modem was. Also there is an apartment downstairs and the baby that lives there cried all night and kept us all up for half the night! Other than that we had a lovely time and especially enjoyed the beauty of the surrounding area, my son and I had a sunset walk to the beach and came back via the golf course where there are wild deer - a highlight for us animal lovers!"
19192445,205192687,2017-10-21,133417062,Lin,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
19192445,213106720,2017-11-19,146397442,Levent,"This is a great location and it is a lovely home.  I wouldnt mind to own this place to live... It has the conveniences of your own house. My suggestions to our host is just a few.  A trash basket in the master bedroom’s bathroom and perhaps a some bottled water in the kitchen.  The automated security locks on the garage door and the main entry to the house are great.  I may of missed however little instructions for 30 second automatic lock was convenient but needs to be informed.  
I am really glad I rented this place for a weekend and I will consider it again in the future for sure... By the way I live only 1.5 hours away from this address but for the convenience and feel for living in the area won’t think twice for an occasion..."
19192445,213664291,2017-11-22,73733790,Yemi,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
19192445,227655244,2018-01-15,25197729,Thea,This was a fantastic house for a group. The rooms were comfy and the living room/kitchen/dining room was perfect for group hangouts and making dinner! We had a great time in the hot tub and the view of the ocean from the main room was stunning!
19192445,234102984,2018-02-11,1412799,Corinne,"We had an exceptional stay in Pacific Grove. I have stayed at several AirBnB's now, and this was the simplest ""checkin"" process thus far: the front door and garage are opened via access code (no keys!) which it makes it really easy to come and go - especially for larger groups when entrances/exits are staggered. It creates great flexibility. 

The house is on a hill with views of the water. Safe neighborhood. A short drive to the Pebble Beach golf courses and downtown Carmel. I hope to stay again next year."
19192445,242322002,2018-03-11,6925444,Hilde,"This was a great place for a weekend get-away with friends. Straight forward check-in and check-out, lots of space and great amenities. Thank you for having us."
19213454,166222010,2017-07-03,132204415,Philip,"It was a pleasure to have Tiffany as a host. She was very communicative and friendly. Her home is cozy, and a very short drive away from many of Monterey's attractions. Would definitely stay in her place again! "
19213454,170495236,2017-07-15,21510103,Lisa Marie,"This house was everything we hoped for. There was plenty of room for our family of 5 and the beds were comfy with nice linens. The kitchen was well equipped to cook and Tiffany even had the fridge stocked with a little water and condiments to get us started. The living room was comfy to sit and visit and the dining room was a nice size. The wifi worked better than ours at home. We were able to walk to the waterfront which was lovely. Tiffany also stocked the baths with soaps, shampoos and luxurious towels. We'd be happy to stay here again. "
19213454,174684550,2017-07-26,134780374,Steven,"Extraordinarily peaceful, calm, quiet, cozy home.  Restful colors, comfortable furnishings and perfect Feng Shui. Tiffany is so warm, friendly, helpful and easy to work with. Looking forward to our next stay."
19213454,176354418,2017-07-30,1691118,Patricia,"While not an ocean view, this home was perfectly located for us in a quiet, tree-lined street, easy to find and access.  A quick ride to the ocean front, shopping, a short car jaunt to Carmel, and two tickets to see the Aquarium included.  I  would highly recommend this lovely home in Pacific Grove for anyone looking for a quiet retreat amid the hustle and bustle of a picturesque, but busy tourist destination.  We were two couples together and it was a great fit for the four of us.  Thank you Tiffany."
19213454,178539550,2017-08-05,143428944,Karolee,"This house has construction going on! I believe the picture of the front of the house was purposely taken at such an angle so that the construction cannot be seen. Also, the backyard is filled with boxes of stuff and could not be used. We were not told of that.  Yes, it was disclosed that a ""project""  of pavers were being put down in the driveway, but that it should not interfere with our stay. It greatly interfered! It was extremely noisy with drills, saws, pounding and a huge cement truck coming in to pour cement.  It was awful! I do not feel that the owner was completely honest with the amount of work being done to her house.  If she had been, I would have passed on it!"
19213454,182500751,2017-08-14,54124890,Kira,Tiffany's home was clean and in a quiet neighborhood. She was a great host and we got to check in early which was nice since we had drove 5 hours to get there. We went to Monterey for my cousin's wedding and it was great staying with my family instead of two different hotel rooms. It was also in a great location and central to everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again. :)
19213454,185091251,2017-08-20,10609505,John,"A fun, cozy house, very close to downtown Pacific Grove and Monterey. What sold me were the firm, comfortable beds and the quiet house/location. Recommended!"
19213454,190742065,2017-09-04,20114881,David,"We found the Walnut house to be a great fit for our short getaway. Pacific Grove was a quiet area and just down the street on Lighthouse Ave. there were many great restaurants. 

Our host also provided us with two passes to the Aquarium which was a great because visiting this attraction was high up on our to do list. 

The house had essentials for the kitchen and the house was clean when we arrived. 

It was great to come home to a quiet secluded house after a long day of sightseeing."
19213454,196331094,2017-09-22,7224860,Simon,"This home is in wonderful Pacific Grove and is a ten minute walk from Lover's Point Beach, which is an incredibly beautiful spot. It's also about ten minutes from downtown Pacific Beach and good coffee and a bakery, and is very comfortable with three bedrooms and plenty of space."
19273446,165407359,2017-07-01,75049281,Aline,We enjoyed our time at Carie's place. Everything was perfect and really new! The comunication was so good and they were very friendly with our kids.

Thank you, Carie!"
19273446,173720016,2017-07-23,16625395,Kevin,I stayed here with a group of 4 people and had a great experience.  The location is perfect for visiting Monterey's popular tourist spots.  The hosts were very friendly and made us feel welcome at all times. I highly recommend staying here and enjoying this beautiful home and gorgeous area.
19273446,174699174,2017-07-26,39861293,Caylin,We stayed here as a couple and two single friends and it was perfect! Such a great location for exploring Monterey and Pacific Grove. The pictures don't do it justice. Carie and Scott have done a great job decorating and making your stay comfortable. Dogs didn't bark while we were here but we did get to see them go out in the yard - very cute! We would definitely come back.
19273446,178123702,2017-08-04,15127788,Lauren,"Carie's place was perfect for my visit to the Monterey Bay Peninsula. Her place was very spacious and it is in an excellent location. Carie did a great job decorating and providing us with everything we needed for our stay - stocked kitchen and snacks, soft towels, comfy beds, etc. 

My friend and took advantage of how walkable the town was and checked out nearby restaurants, coffee shops, and Fisherman's Warf. We also loved driving around the peninsula and checked out Pebble Beach, 17-mile drive, Point Lobos State Reserve, and Big Sur. 

We had a great stay in Pacific Grove and definitely recommend it!"
19273446,179098455,2017-08-06,8678926,Andrew,"Carie and Scott were wonderful hosts and the cottage was perfect for me and my two friends: comfortable, clean as a whistle, and a great location. Although we weren't walkers, it's within easy walking distance of shops, restaurants, and attractions. The small amenities (snacks, water, wine, and fresh flowers) made us feel particularly welcome."
19273446,180228806,2017-08-09,136501499,Brian,"Super clean, recently remodeled space in an historic home. Short walk along oceanside trail to Monterey Bay Aquarium, Cannery Row and Lover's Point. Great hosts with clear communications and a desire to make your stay perfect. Two separate beds allowed privacy & a kitchen made meals easy. This was the highlight of our California trip - a perfect place to stay in a fun area!"
19273446,181419116,2017-08-12,87338544,Angela,Carie's place was so tranquil and tastefully decorated. The beds are comfortable and there is a nice dining nook and good size kitchen. This place is two blocks from the beach and close to everything! We walked along the ocean to the Aquarium with our six year old boy. We will definitely come back!
19273446,182502618,2017-08-14,29310763,Edwin,This is the perfect place to visit Monterey/Pacific Grove. A nice and gozy place near the places to visit. Scott and Carie did everything to make you feel at home. Highly recommended!

She is an absolute lovely host, offering more than you could ask for.  We never had any issues with her dogs making any noise while we were staying there.  We walked down the street and there were cute stores and excellent restaurants."

Aquarium was 10 minute walk if you don't stop on the trail and just enjoy waves splashing up against the rocks. If you only booked two days, it's not enough."

The apartment is simply furnished by very cute. We had plenty of amenities and felt well taken care of.

The neighborhood was quiet, the neighbors were friendly, and attractions were a short stroll away. We walked to the Monterey Aquarium, restaurants, and the bike rental shop on the 17 mike trail.

Kitchen had everything needed to cook if you wanted to and Carie even went out of her way to provide a blender when asked about it. Very quiet and walking distance to the water and coastal trail. I will definitely stay here next time I'm around Monterey and would highly recommend this cozy Airbnb.

Super clean space and kitchen is well stocked with the essentials. Beds were comfy and was a great home away from home for a week. Neighborhood is quiet and location is perfect. Definitely would recommend!

They were so very sweet & accommodating about my 13 month old who struggled a bit that night (they reside upstairs). We would absolutely stay again!
19273446,212634043,2017-11-18,26863522,Jill,"Location, location, location. This cottage is in walking distance to the Aquarium and Cannery Row. It's also in close proximity to local shops and restaurants. Although you are very close to everything, the location is in a residential area so you get that local vibe. 

Carie's place was spotless and the pictures she posted are spot on. It was going to rain when we arrived and the heater worked wonderfully. Also, if you like hot hot water (like I do) in the shower, you will be in heaven. We brought our toddler and the place was so clean and there was nothing he could 'get into' lying around. The master bedroom is large enough to accommodate a pack and play easily. The welcoming touches (snacks, sparkling water, flat water) were thoughtful. I had to make a change to our reservation and Carie was always quick to respond. 

If we get a chance to visit this area again, we would love to stay here."
19273446,213384230,2017-11-20,158364220,Anthony,"Carie and Scott were such great hosts! They provided everything we needed (linens, snacks, clear instructions, etc.) for our stay and were a great source of local knowledge. We would definitely stay here again!"
19273446,213887705,2017-11-23,2831387,Scott,Great location and value!
19273446,214332384,2017-11-25,127066997,Chris,Great location. Great hosts. Beautiful apartment. Thoughtful touches like flashlights and a bottle of wine. Short walk to Monterey. One block from ocean trail. Running distance to 17 mile drive. The best!
19273446,217112310,2017-12-07,47334964,Nat,"Lovely people, lovely place, lovely experience. Nothing but good things to say about Scott and Carie. "
19273446,218056073,2017-12-10,2450284,Tamsen,"Charming, ground floor unit - close to all the beauty and “action” of a sleepy california beach town."
19273446,219759254,2017-12-18,2752462,Deb,What I liked the most about Carie's place was the location. Morning walks along the bay to Lover's Point were a great way to start the day. Monterey aquarium and downtown were within walking distance. The apartment was exactly as described. 
19273446,220528159,2017-12-22,106303840,Amber,Carie is an amazing host and everything was so clean and organized. The location to Cannery Row and the aquarium was amazing! She even gave us a personal farewell upon leaving.
19273446,220984285,2017-12-24,35801767,Ranju,"Great property and walking distance to Cannery Row, Fishermans wharf, and PG.  Really appreciated the fact she accommodated us for an early checkin and late check out. That's a big help with kids. Property was bigger than expected and didn't feel crowded even with 5 adults. Thanks for a memorable stay!"
19273446,221482254,2017-12-26,4314948,Fiela,"Super cozy and  beautiful home, very beach and warm. we really enjoyed our stay there. We loved the kitchen and all the touches from the placemats to the towels to the keurig :)"
19273446,222426102,2017-12-29,32619550,Shannon,"This is a perfect place for a family! The five of us fit comfortably, and we loved the location which was close to Pacific Grove restaurants and walkable to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Parking was easy, and there were lots of thoughtful notes and amenities that made everything easier for us. The hosts were personable and kind."
19273446,224292626,2018-01-02,28406498,Courtney,We had a great time here and would stay again!
19273446,224919770,2018-01-04,51029438,Kimia,"Beautiful, peaceful spot! The little details show their thoughtfulness as hosts. Very clean, good communicator, highly recommend this place!"
19273446,226628685,2018-01-11,110312636,Sheldon,"Carie's place is ideal for a stay in Monterey. It's a short (and very pleasant) walk to shops and to the cannery row area. Just a block away from the coast as well, about a 5 minute walk from lovers point. Highly recommended!"
19273446,227408451,2018-01-14,146613260,Betty,Amazing location and we could hear the waves crashing at night.  Very comfortable!
19273446,227888147,2018-01-16,66465290,Shannon,This place is so wonderful. It is comfortable and has a kitchen full of basically anything you would need (except a microwave). It is the perfect location to walk to all the fantastic things to see in Pacific Grove and downtown restaurants. Just a note: Ceilings are low for someone 6’4.
19273446,229058585,2018-01-21,72589030,Emily,"Very cozy and lovely home that is very close to the aquarium, shops, and restaurants. House was very clean, organized and had everything we needed. Carie & Scott were quick to answer any questions or concerns we had, and they also provided detailed driving instructions to the place, which was very helpful. Parking around area is easy. Good wifi and the complimentary snack/drinks were a plus! Also a close walk to the coastal trail for scenic views and for a morning walk. Overall very relaxing and would definitely book again with them!"
19273446,230243872,2018-01-27,22587820,Renata,"Nice touches - bottle of wine, coffee and some kitchen basics, lots of towels, a few snacks. It's not a fancy place considering the cost of staying in this area, it was clean and comfortable for those on relatively modest budgets. One block from the bay and a walking trail. Carie was really communicative and flexible."
19273446,231531750,2018-02-01,7301653,Jonathan,"really nice place for 2-4 people to stay. Just a few blocks from sweet town of Pacific Grove, very close to Monterey and Carmel. The apartment is very nicely furnished with lots of amenities in the kitchen and living room. The host was very helpful in terms of check in and helping us out on directions to various places.
We'll definitely plan on visiting again.
THanks Carie!"
19273446,234172576,2018-02-11,28027377,Matthew,"Carie was a fantastic host. The home was beautiful and in a great location of Pacific Grove, and Carie was very warm and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again!"
19273446,236248232,2018-02-18,59956796,Ingrid,"The location was excellent, very close to walking/running paths, the aquarium, Cannery Row, restaurants & beaches. The extra touches provided was awesome, there was coffee, tea, sugar, cream, wine, shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste and more. The space was nice, but definitely low ceilings! I am 6 feet tall and my head touched the bathroom ceiling in spots. Beds were comfortable, plenty of blankets & towels."
19273446,237140124,2018-02-21,104096,Marc,If you want to walk to the ocean and the aquarium and to restaurants this is the place for you. Fabulous part of town.
19273446,238448148,2018-02-25,25240536,Emmalee,This place is the cutest! We had a great girls weekend in Carrie’s Home. It’s a quick walk to the ocean side trail and plenty of street parking. We appreciated the hospitality of wine and snacks upon arrival. We would highly recommend a stay here!
19273446,239204625,2018-02-28,22377463,Regine,"Appartement très cosy très bien situé près de l’aquarium, du bord de mer, je le recommande"
19273446,240412687,2018-03-04,141848660,Robert,Everything was great!  This was our first time using Air BnB and staying at Carie's place was exceptional!  She was so positive and helpful in getting us through the process and helping us locate the B&B and finding our way around town. We would absolutely stay again and recommend her to anyone who is considering visiting Monterey!
19273446,241106356,2018-03-07,172644804,Tyler,"Wonderful location in Monterey. The aquarium is only a few blocks away, maybe a 10-15min walk, with the ""down town"" area being about a 30-40 min walk. The weather was perfect so there was plenty to do and see."
19273446,243124358,2018-03-14,54538673,Chelsea,"We loved the area, very close to a walking path on the water with beautiful views. The space and the hosts were great and accomodating."
19273446,246640115,2018-03-25,36133628,Elizabeth,"We stayed here for our wedding with our best man and maid of honor. It was absolutely perfect. We had an absolutely wonderful time at Carie and Scott's. They were so friendly and hospitable, we loved staying there and chatting with them. And their doggies were so cute! They gave us a little welcome package and their rental was so comfortable and darling. It made a very good hangout spot for us ""youngin's"" of the wedding (meaning us in our late 20s). Not only that, it was close to everything! Lovers point and the aquarium/canary row. Just a walk away! Thank you so much :)"
19273446,247221807,2018-03-27,61832852,Matt,"The apartment was clean, easy to find and restaurants are within easy walking distance. Being on a quiet street there was no noise disturbance, and the apartment is ideally located to explore the surrounding area of Monterey. I highly recommend staying here and would do so again myself."
19273446,249185019,2018-04-01,152507877,Toni,The apartment is adorable and comfortable. Carie was friendly and helpful. We had a great time!
19273446,250324976,2018-04-04,138172615,Heather,"Carrie's place was a perfect location from which to explore Pacific Grove and the surrounding area.  We loved being able to walk to restaurants and the aquarium.  The space is clean, charming, and a short walk from the beach.  Especially awesome was being so close to the beach - we saw baby harbor seals only a few hours old!  Thanks Carrie for making our trip so enjoyable."
19273446,250965220,2018-04-06,152521411,David,"Just perfect in every way. Carrie is a lovely host, the location is perfect, the set up is ideal."
19273446,251832536,2018-04-08,4629362,Grace,"My husband and I stayed in Carie's home with our 14 month old daughter. The location was perfect! We took a nice walk to the beach trail, steps away from the home, and the aquarium is just a short half mile away from the home! We loved all the cute touches and were grateful for the coffee, wine, and snacks!

Just a tip: If you're maybe more than 6' foot tall, you might be a bit too tall for the shower!"
19273446,252471271,2018-04-10,30950047,Frederick,"Lovely beach house, Carrie was a super host."
19273446,253222002,2018-04-13,43714,Sarah,"This is a lovely space, very clean and comfortable.  It is a great price for a central location, where you can walk to the aquarium and Cannery Row and then head in the opposite direction for great restaurants in Pacific Grove. Carie and her husband are very nice and even supplied a few bottles of wine that made our picnic up the coast extra special.  I highly recommend it!"
19273446,254698833,2018-04-17,173893921,Joan,Carie is a great host and the location is excellent. Highly recommend this flat for a lovely stay at Pacific Grove!
19273446,255500844,2018-04-20,110478589,Courtney,"The location is amazing! We (my husband, 1 year old son and I) had a great stay, the residence is so cute."
19606480,175387820,2017-07-28,130395858,Bill,"Great Beachhouse! Ocean basically across the street. We sat and watched sea lions and seals on the ocean bench as if at the house, so close and so beautiful. Coffee shop, grill and awesome full dining restaurant about a block away at Lovers Point. My wife Kim, son Blake 18, girlfriend  Lexey 17 had a very nice time. You need to know it is a very clean well appointed beach house, not a big home, suited us perfectly. Couldn't get much better! 
Bill, Kim, Blake & Lexey July 2017"
19606480,175772480,2017-07-29,13871499,(Email hidden by Airbnb),"Such a perfect location! We loved being so close to the ocean, and this house had everything we needed for a short weekend trip."
19606480,176398852,2017-07-30,16834291,Shyam,The house was exactly as described. Joy kept me informed and was responsive to all my questions. Highly recommend!
19606480,176788961,2017-07-31,83843280,Sabrina,"I fell in love with this place. The views were amazing, the weather was perfect an the home was comfortable and cozy. I wish we could have stayed longer!"
19606480,179905369,2017-08-08,86469798,Arianne,"Küchenutensilien bis auf Dosenöffner perfekt. Kühlschrank mit Eiswürfeln!
Gemütlich eingerichtet!
Und tatsächlich wunderbar um Otter einen Block weiter an der Felsküste zu beobachten!"
19606480,182082421,2017-08-13,30428051,Linda,Location was great. Home smaller than expected and beds uncomfortable
19606480,182878220,2017-08-15,9244127,Chelsea,"This place is adorable--the epitome of a beach cottage, but the best part of the house is the location. It is seconds from an awesome beach that is perfect for kids and restaurants and the aquarium are also right there. The host could not have been more easy to communicate with, and the house was stocked with all kinds of conveniences and even toys and books for the kids. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to all my friends."
19606480,183584946,2017-08-17,48719622,Austin,"Fantastic, cute little themed getaway. The house distinctly plays on the mermaid theme in a perfect way. Bonus, the listing didn't mention it, but Wi-Fi was available."
19606480,185059500,2017-08-20,140480154,Jordan,"This was a great cottage / bungalow steps from the water and pathways in Pacific Grove.  The location couldnt have been better, parking and amenities were as described and pictured.  The only warning I would give future vacationers in regards to the house is if you are tall the bathroom doorway, shower, and ceilings are very low.  I had to duck and hit my head more than once (I am 6'3""). Other than that the place was amazing located close to restaurants the beach and all the golf courses in the area.  I would recommend  this place to friends and family (5'10"" and shorter) for future rentals."
19606480,186183493,2017-08-23,28244157,Christina,"A delightful cottage in a lovely location near the ocean in Charming Pacific Grove, near some nice shops and restaurants. 
Much better than staying in Monterey near the aquarium much less crowded and more 'real', yet only a mile walk away. 
Very close to the 17 mile drive round the coast which we had fun cycling. You can hire bikes a few steps away, and there is also a lovely beach there at Lovers Point. 
The house is compact but has a well equipped kitchen with big fridge and cooker and plenty of room for 4 of us with 2 double bedrooms plus a good sized sofa bed in the living room. Beds were comfortable. Joy was a great host and very friendly and helpful."
19606480,186502309,2017-08-24,4987041,J.J.,Great location and great value
19606480,188274924,2017-08-28,142258343,Wendy,"We had a wonderful stay in the Mermaid House! We stayed with our three little ones, and they absolutely loved it. It was a wonderful surprise to find two bins of toys and a step stool in the bathroom. There is Wi-Fi and Cable TV. Most importantly the place is super cute and located in an ideal location. We would definitely recommend staying here and, Joy the manager was very nice and helpful."
19606480,189776828,2017-09-02,4445803,Jenna,Terri's place was lovely.  We had a wonderful time.
19606480,190678601,2017-09-04,70330457,Bailee,Location was great for the price! Joy (manager) responded right away to any questions we had. Good space for a family trip. Thanks!
19606480,191010699,2017-09-05,26847974,Daniel,"Really good location, close to many public beaches, kayak/snorkeling/SCUBA diving rental places, restaurants, grocery stores, etc."
19606480,191774198,2017-09-08,65646780,Chris,we had a very pleasant stay in this charming beach house .. it is very cozy very well located in calm and close to everything .. the owner is very kind and helpful . I confirm the other opinions and I recommend firmly.
19606480,192595936,2017-09-10,11581890,Katherine,"We stayed one night here after spending an evening at the aquarium. There's easy parking, and it's great that you can walk to the aquarium (even if it is a little bit of a hike, it's at least a scenic one). It is right next to Lovers Point where you can rent bikes, and we found some really cute places to eat in Pacific Grove. The beds were comfortable, the house was clean, the decor was entertaining, and we had smooth and easy experience with our whole stay. The only downside I can think of is that some of the ceilings are pretty low, so if you're above 6'0"" you may want to watch your head. Will definitely be renting again if we find ourselves back in the area!"
19606480,195531752,2017-09-19,5940931,Harriet,"The location is good, about a 6min drive to Monterey. The house itself is ok, we only stayed for one night and that was enough. As we were there for such a short time it is hard to give a rounded view. The place is obviously well lived in and I imagine the owner has dogs as there was a slight smell. It served its purpose for us as a stop over. We arrived at 6pm. Got ready for dinner at 8pm and then left the following morning at around 7am so didn't spend much time at the property. It could do with a bit if a refresh in terms of decor and there is no full length mirror."
19606480,196025973,2017-09-21,69870043,Dave,"Great location, really cosy cottage with lots of character, full kitchen with everything you need. Great location for a family stop over and we loved the seals on the beach and walking along the seaside."
19606480,197131071,2017-09-24,75050019,John,"Mermaid's delight was as described. Really close to the ocean. Over 6'2"" you may have some places in the house to duck. Overall great place to spend a night or week I imagine and close to beautiful shorelines."
19606480,198222376,2017-09-28,10937311,Dustin,very close to ocean!
19606480,199325174,2017-10-01,88348574,Mary,Loved the location and price. The ocean view from the beach house is spectacular. Checking in and out was a breeze. The bathroom door and shower stall ceiling is too low for a 6 foot or taller person.
19606480,203272015,2017-10-14,6032132,Eliza,"The airbnb was good but could easily be great. Needs to be instructions in manage guest about where to find the lights and how to turn on the heating. The place was freezing because the gas heater didnt work and an extra duvet would have been great. The pull out couch was very uncomfortable. Otherwise, the place we clean, good value and excellent location."
19606480,205805082,2017-10-22,80824888,Dan,"Location, location, location! This is a great spot to use as a home base for exploring the beauty of the Monterey Bay area."
19606480,207766771,2017-10-29,156490942,Julio,Overall a great place but hard to find the light switches at first.
19606480,214081087,2017-11-24,151446269,Kent,"The location is great with a view of the ocean from the property. Great to get up and take in the sunrise. Finding light switches can be a bit challenging, as well as, working he thermostat. The place is spacious with enough parking for four vehicles."
19606480,229286146,2018-01-22,165818896,Mike,Cozy place. great location
19606480,234142024,2018-02-11,110718356,Tony,Cute little beach cottage right by the ocean. Perfect for a stay in Monterrey or pebble beach. Comfortably sleeps 4 adults without needing to share beds
19606480,236645096,2018-02-19,43820779,Kim,Mermaid's Delight was perfect! It was super cozy and was a wonderful home base for my family during our weekend getaway. Close to everything and Terri provided some awesome recommendations for local food!
19606480,239955568,2018-03-03,96869745,Patrick,Exactly as advertised.  Could use a little airing out after the damp season but location can't be beat.
19606480,240389827,2018-03-04,170641276,Jacqueline,Loved the ocean view!!!
19606480,242354601,2018-03-11,54904910,Jillian,"This was the perfect little house for a quick weekend getaway. If we stayed any longer, it might have gotten old to have to bend down to see myself in the bathroom mirror (I’m 5’4), or for my boyfriend to have to crouch down in the shower. This space was small and had very low ceilings, but otherwise everything was perfect. We would stay again!"
19606480,244513173,2018-03-18,89898083,Mark,Great location

19606480,248154922,2018-03-30,9344010,Alexander,Great spot for a quick stay in Monterey! Very homey and enough space for four adults to stay comfortably. Amazing view of the sunrise from the upstairs bedroom.
19606480,251311155,2018-04-07,4247840,Ann,"Mermaid House was absolutely brilliant! If I could have given the location over 5 stars, I would have done. Communication was great, if I had a problem, it was responded to super fast. If I had questions about things, the response was always very friendly and informative.

In relation to some other reviews: Light switches are easy to find, all clearly marked. Beds are comfortable! 

We loved the house which was a home from home. Really so lovely to stay in this old fashioned type wooden house and only a minute away from the beautiful coastline and Lover Point. I am an immature nature photographer and the nature here is off the scale! So lovely to just walk across the street and see Harbour seals, Great Egrets, Ground squirrels and even on a couple of day Sea otters too.

Locally there are many lovely places to eat. We really liked The Beach House at lover's Point (2 mins walk), Passionfish (8 mins walk) and Hulas (15 mins walk). There are supermarkets in easy reach too.

For Whale watching we preferred an operator out of Moss landing (30 mins drive) called Sanctuary Cruises. Its well worth travelling there and going out on their smaller boat. It is less crowded than some of the well advertised whale watches going out of Monterey Bay. The guys on board have great knowledge and their boat is so nice. All in all the smaller boat offered a much nicer experience. We saw Humpbacks, Orcas and Grey whales.

Mermaid House was such a great experience, thanks for having us, we would love to come back and stay!"
19606480,254052327,2018-04-15,32232185,Shanna,"Great little place in a fabulous location. The water is a few steps away from the door:) To top it all off, the property manager is extremely helpful and responsive!"

19674285,173714510,2017-07-23,45951161,Joon,Check in was super efficient and the rental was blocks to downtown. The place was clean with so much character. Definitely worth staying here!
19674285,175806036,2017-07-29,141869017,Barbara,There is a great deal about PG that is absolutely cool and this place was delightful to stay at. Each check in; super fast communication and you can't beat the price/location/amenities. 2 thumbs up!

19674285,182074667,2017-08-13,10220132,Sunil,"My wife, baby, and I rented this house in Pacific Grove and loved it. It was larger and nicer than the photos made it seem.  The interior is fairly modern and everything works perfect.  There is a very nice back patio with 3 different sections.  We found it to be plenty of room for the 3 of us and walked to downtown Pacific Grove (just 3 blocks/5 minutes) almost every morning/night.  We found it easy to drive to the aquarium and kids museum as well.  We highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a nice/clean spot for a weekend getaway!"
19674285,185526072,2017-08-21,2089665,Pavel & Heather,"Great 2-bedroom home on the corner of quiet streets in Pacific Grove.  Beautiful bay windows and natural light... watch the deer walk down the street in the morning, literally!  Very clean with all the extras you might need for your stay.  Well organized check-in and out and overall communications, seamless.  Hope we can stay again."
19674285,189426542,2017-09-01,10176594,Ruthie,Wonderful little house with iconic Pacific Grove garden. Incredibly qiet - and the house was super clean. Rasy walk to shops and stores and ocean!
19674285,190747240,2017-09-04,70979457,Adriana,"It was a very, very, very hot weekend even in Pacific Grove. We walked in to the house Friday night, and felt the heat right away. The temperature inside the house was 87 at 8 p.m. But my husband just loved the cottage. It had a nice deck, which we got to enjoy it every single night. It was cooler outside than inside the house. The cottage was located in a quiet neighborhood, but within a walking distance to the downtown, 17th street (Fandango restaurant), the beach, and the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary. We even walked to the Cannery Row in Monterey.

It was a charming and homey cottage, and we would rent it again in the future."

19674285,197135274,2017-09-24,69347107,Emily,"Great place and great communication from the host. Be prepared for thin walls with earplugs or a noise machine (we used an iPhone app) if you are sharing the house! Overall, a great experience! "

Beds are comfortable and there were plenty of clean linens. Wish there was some salt and more coffee for our breakfasts. Otherwise, it was perfect!"
19674285,215285436,2017-11-28,115834884,Naru,This was a great little place in a wonderful location close to many Monterey attractions.  My family and I had a lovely long weekend here.
19674285,237659798,2018-02-23,41666098,Jeffrey,"Great place, great location! Easy couple minute walk to a playground and maybe 8-10 minutes to lovers point beach. Really a great location, baby naps in the afternoon, big sister can go with dad to rent bikes and ride along the bay for an hour or two.  Quick drives to the aquarium/cannery row, etc. Small grocery store walk-able. Backyard area for kids to play, comfortable beds, lots of beverage coasters which the two year old loved to play with. Overall a great place for a family of four, everything we need definitely would recommend / stay again."
19674285,247224049,2018-03-27,29066205,Jan,Our family of three had a perfect 11 days in this home. We liked the quiet neighborhood. We used the grill several times. The outside space was perfect to relax after our daily outings. The beds were very comfortable and linens and supply of soft towels were appreciated. We cooked at home most meals and found all we needed in the cupboards. Of course we supplied our own food and spices. Best of all was having a dishwasher for cleanup. Also having many outside adventures made the washer and dryer an added bonus. Our check in and out were effortless. Thanks to Rhonda  it was a great home away from home.
19830907,182035782,2017-08-13,66481619,Lisa,"Hank & Julie's house is absolutely lovely. The open living areas in the house are spacious yet cozy and the kitchen is beautiful with all new appliances. Julie was so quick to respond to our messages and the information they left with suggestions was so helpful. The space was clean, inviting, and relaxing. 

The location is fantastic because it's so close to Monterey, downtown Pacific Grove and just a short drive to Carmel. 

I would highly recommend this space and would love to stay here again in the future!"

The house is in a great location for easy access to Pebble Beach and all the Car Week events around Carmel and the Monterey area. Check in was easy and seem less. I would totally recommend to anyone wanting to stay near 17 mile and the ocean. "

The house is in a sweet neighborhood and has quick access to the shoreline and trail there for walking or jogging.

19830907,249169759,2018-04-01,65388111,Lauren,"We were greeted by a bottle of wine and a pristine and lovely home. This house had all the amenities one could want and a location that can’t be beat. It is a brief walk to the ocean’s edge and just slightly longer to downtown Pacific Grove. If you are a runner,walker or cyclist, this location is just about perfect as a starting point. We enjoyed the hot tub (a great excuse for star-gazing), the well-stocked kitchen where we could make our own meals, and the quiet neighborhood where deer come out in late afternoon to graze on the golf course. We hope to return soon."

The cottage is lovely and recently update with everything you could ask for. The location is great - a quick walk to the beach and scenic walking trail in one direction and shops and restaurants in the other. And it was especially perfect for us with a toddler as it is right across the street from a really well equipped playground. Marci herself was very communicative and helpful. Oh and the beds and bedding are soooo comfy. A perfect stay. Thank you, Marci!"
19910607,206112213,2017-10-23,251119,Michael,"Thank you again! We had a wonderful stay at the Caledonia Cottage.

We would stay again in a heart beat!"

The house is beautifully decorated and comfortable and located across from a park with playground and basketball court that was great for our kids.
It is also a 2 minute walk to down town Pacific Grove and great restaurants and a 2 minute walk to the beach.
We can’t wait to go back!

Thank you Marci and Richard!"
19994957,182025234,2017-08-13,923329,Arezou,"Beautiful house in pacific grove near the north entrance of pebble beach. Very close to Asilomar beach which is also magnificent and peaceful. The back yard had so many colorful flowers, and a nice hammock. "

19994957,185015856,2017-08-20,11744079,Rob,"Tim and Laurel were great and their place was exactly what we imagined and wanted. Me, my wife, and our 2 boys stayed in this beautiful house for the weekend and enjoyed everything about our trip. The house is very close to beaches and restaurants which we perfect for visiting Monterey and Pacific Grove. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is also very close. Tim and Laurel were very quick to respond to any questions we had and gave great recommendations for family friendly places nearby to take our family. The house was very clean, large and has a nice open floor plan. We had a blast and would definitely come back and stay here again. Recommended to all!"

19994957,194940574,2017-09-17,7636728,Tamara,"What a beautiful ""peaceful"" home! The home is bigger than what the pictures show. It is a very spaciousness... perfect for our big family. 

As soon as we drove up, the kids were excited to see a deer and two fawns walking down the street. They enjoyed the board games in the rooms and ping pong table in the backyard. It's perfectly set up for children and teenagers, with wifi name and password printed and placed in each room.

Our highlights include:
- A fully equipped kitchen  
- Long table to accommodate our big family
- Hammock and BBQ in the backyard
- Close to the beach
- Board games, paper and markers to color, and ping pong table for the kids
- Quick responses to any questions we had.

The big GGG vs Canelo boxing match was on PPV that weekend. Tim and Laurel were nice enough to let us order the fight. (left them cash for it)

I'd like to add that, not once did I speak to Tim and Laurel over the phone. Every communication was through AirBnB. For my first time using AirBnB, I had a wonderful experience.

We created unforgettable family memories in this home. We would definitely book this home again. 

Thank you, Tim and Laurel! God bless!"

19994957,199389568,2017-10-01,22265412,Kelly,"I highly recommend Tim and Laurel's house for anyone wanting to experience the peaceful charm of the Monterey area. Our family of eight used this lovely house as our base-of-operations for a weekend getaway. We were so happy to stay away from the noise and crowds of Cannery Row, choosing instead the sleepy, forested sweetness of Pacific Grove. We spent our mornings in the sunny backyard, the teens playing ping pong and the adults drinking coffee in their pajamas.  We spent our evenings watching the sunset at Asilomar Beach (a ten minute walk away), then returning to eat dinner or play games in the large dining/living area. Our large family was perfectly comfortable in this spacious and airy house. Heaven!"
19994957,203852327,2017-10-15,18610782,Stephanie,"This place was great for two families staying together. We were visiting for a conference at Asilomar, and this was the perfect off-site accommodation! The yard and living room were great for the kids. Bedrooms and bathrooms were very comfortable. Tim and Laurel added little touches to make us feel at home. They were also very responsive to our questions. Thank you!"

The house was spacious for the 8 of us the outdoor area in the backyard absolutely lovely for relaxing. Was close to downtown Monterey for dinner out. All in all everyone loved it and satisfying 8 people is no easy task. They say how you spend New Years is the window to your year and after staying at Tim & Laurel's 2018 will be amazing
19994957,240425110,2018-03-04,12548045,Grace,"Had such a great stay here with a rather large group for a relaxing weekend retreat. The place is larger in person than in the photos, the Kitchen is well spaced to handle many cooks, the sofas are large enough to fit many people. There's 1 king, 2 queen, and 2 twin beds, plus 3 sofas to sleep on, so definitely can fit a large group. Also really close to the beach and food options in town. Definitely stay with Tim & Laurel!"
19994957,246657557,2018-03-25,13275424,Cyrille,Nice quiet location walking distance to downtown Pacific Grove. Worked well for our family to celebrate my mom’s 75th. Thanks so much for hosting us.
19994957,251901072,2018-04-08,182166361,Doris,"Fabulous host!  Great house in great location.  We slept particularly well in comfortable beds and enjoyed fully equipped cook’s kitchen and lovely backyard.  Thank you for early checkin and letting us stay 1 hr later.  With 8 people in our group, we did not have enough hot water and the wait time for hot water to replenish was only downside to our stay.  But other than that, this was a wonderful rental for our 2 families.  Thank you for quick responses and making our first Airb&b experience a positive one!"
19994957,254125916,2018-04-15,118876251,Jasleen,"We loved our stay. Tim and Laurel were great hosts who answered our questions immediately. The house was beautiful and peaceful, and large enough for our party of 8.  We really enjoyed walking to the beach in the mornings."

20039140,177401963,2017-08-02,9506763,Ed,"Florence & Jeff are amazing. Such sweet and knowledgable host. They helped with booking dinner for us where it was fully booked and luckily they had hooked us up! Having the passes for the aquarium is important if you wish to attend because you by pass the line for people buying tickets day of. Other than that, it's an awesome spot, comfy comfy bed and can't ask for anything else! Highly recommended!"
20039140,180220378,2017-08-09,84070140,Billy,"One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed in. Florence and Jeff were great hosts and were very happy to answer any questions we had. The room is amazing, as is the bathroom. We had the added bonus of getting to use their aquarium passes! I'd like to thank them for a great stay."

20039140,190223177,2017-09-03,64310173,Chris,"The location of the house is pretty good. Both bedroom and bathroom are very spacious. There is only a curtain between the bedroom and bathroom, so you can feel more humidity in the bedroom. It can be good or bad depending on your preference."
20039140,192958322,2017-09-11,86915791,Ted,Great value in a beautiful and quiet area on the Monterey Peninsula.  Florence was the perfect host who’s attention to detail and helpful advice gave us a terrific weekend get away.  The inclusion of two aquarium passes was an added bonus.
20039140,193760249,2017-09-14,5771971,Barbara,Florence's place is in a great location.

20039140,195549316,2017-09-19,67975398,Andrew,"Room was clean and quiet. It was a bit on the bare side but sometimes personal touches can detract from a stay too. Nonetheless, we appreciated the great communication from our host and was a relaxing and quiet place to stay."
20039140,196618277,2017-09-23,6074710,Marlene,"Pros: Very nice hosts and good communication. It's a great location, and a good value. Nice kitchen area to heat up food, etc. The bed is very comfortable. Cons: The space feels very bare. Not big on amenities. Bathroom floor is cold, so bring some slippers. Shower is touchy and could use some maintenance. Definitely not the coziest Airbnb we've stayed in. Some homey touches would be a nice addition."
20039140,198856745,2017-09-30,137038856,Manuela,Really nice place in a typical residential area. Jeff is a very kind and helpful host.
20039140,202067647,2017-10-09,152771931,Linda,"Great location BUT beware Home is not ""homey"" everything is covered when you go to sit down on dinning chairs, couch, chair. There is NO TV in house to listen to news or relax to, bring your own if you want this. Kitchen is not easy to find what equipment to use as the tenant  and owner have cabinets with items in for their use. Owners come over daily to check on place. There is not an easy power source to plug car into if you have a hybrid, it would leave the side door open which is not safest thing to do even though PG is a VERY safe neighborhood."
20039140,203020362,2017-10-13,13690134,Jacqueline,"Hi,
Jeff and Florence are very pleasant and helpful, and Jeff went out of his way to use his aquarium membership to enable us to get in for free. The room is more than just a room, one can also use the kitchen and there is even fridge space for guests. The room is very clean and the light is good. There is no view but it's near the water and shops. Thank you!"
20039140,203839189,2017-10-15,21362751,Leslie,The bed is very comfortable and the place is very spacious. The host was very friendly and accommodating! 10 minute walk to the restaurants and coffee shops.
20039140,206515539,2017-10-25,49079021,Norma,"The room size is great. Having the fan over the bed was nice as it was unseasonably warm. The bathroom is large but dated - the shower knob did not stay in place and warm water was not available in the evening. Having a hair dryer available was a nice touch.
The host was not present during our stay so we did not benefit from any insider local information about the area."
20039140,214871814,2017-11-26,26167824,Noah,We had a great time in Monterey! The room was clean and comfortable. Florence and Jeff were friendly and helpful.
20039140,221185004,2017-12-25,981613,Sidharta Surya,"Florence's place is great. It's super close to the downtown as well as the beach. Jeff (Florence's husband) also gave us a free bottle of wine, thanks so much!"
20039140,230669809,2018-01-28,34878228,Hui,"非常热心的两口子,男主人和我老公很能聊!一进去就帮我们介绍参观,可惜晚了一点,介绍的参观不接受预定了,于是我就开始自己煮饭了,男主人把他的厨房详细的介绍给我,很大,非常好用!第二天早上还自己煮了点面条,中午去帮我们预定的参观享受了海鲜大餐,还去Florence介绍的学校参观了一下,不错的体验,希望下次还能住这"
20039140,233450786,2018-02-09,84578061,Bill,"Needs a lot of improvements! Old sheets that did not match, old smelly pillows are just the start. No HVAC, no AC or heat. Small space heater was provided but.... dirty shower, great area, but this house is just not ready for prime time.  Florence is a nice lady, but not ready for hosting"
20039140,234156232,2018-02-11,33523418,Nate,"Florence was great at communicating with my friends and I before our arrival. She also opened up another master bedroom to my friends and I at no cost. 
The home is very clean in a quiet neighborhood that’s a 5-minute walk from the beach.
The night of our arrival, she got us reservations at a nice restaurant and the following morning was able to get us into the aquarium with her membership."
20039140,236207839,2018-02-18,169565534,Clayton,"Florence's place was great, we were in contact with her husband Jeff for our stay and his communication with us was fantastic. He made us feel at home and gave us their aquarium passes. It was cold in the room when we arrived and it took a while for the stand alone heater to warm up the room, but once it did we were comfortable. It was also nice to have access to the kitchen and its amenities. Tenants who shared the common areas were very nice as well. Very clean place. It was a perfect room for two adults and a child. Location is great as it's very close to the aquarium and cannery row as well as 17-mile drive and Pacific Grove shops and restaurants."
20039140,236568023,2018-02-19,2539225,Lei,"It was a great experience of residing on Florence/Jeff's place during the long weekend. Jeff gave us a very warm welcome with all the detailed instructions. The room is spacious and a heater is considerably put there too. It is a pleasure to talk to Jeff and things went very smoothly during our stay. 

Highly recommend this place."
20039140,242409879,2018-03-11,19464008,Jim,"Close walking distance to Pacific Grove and to the bay.  Very quiet neighborhood, Lot's of morning and afternoon sun makes this house bright and cheery. Hosts are very communicative and easy to work with. Plenty of space for two or more.  House was so clean.  My only gripe was that it was a bit cold inside.  Make sure you know how to turn on the heater.  We forgot to ask.  Since we were there for a night, it didn't matter much."
20039140,243392158,2018-03-15,17261016,Joey,"Florence made us feel very welcome. They have a permanent tenant in the home that kept to himself. The home was clean and tidy, although it is beginning to show its age. There is ample living space, comfortable but more than we needed for a pied-a-terre. Florence responded quickly to any issues with home. Use of guest passes to the aquarium saved us money and made for an enjoyable morning."
20039140,244475824,2018-03-18,21988935,Arky'S B&B,"Jeff is very warm and kindly man :)))
House and room is big .
We have a very quiet stay :))"
20039140,246968271,2018-03-26,14910649,Todd,The room and house are nice and the location is very convenient without being in the middle of a busy area.
20039140,247504681,2018-03-28,28317367,Chad,"We had a wonderful stay. Florence and Jeff were friendly warm and accommodating and the location couldn't be more perfect! Just a short drive or even walk from stores, restaurants and the beach. The room itself is large with a great bathroom and plenty of privacy throughout the house. Perfect for a couple or friends!"
20039140,249141847,2018-04-01,59506119,Christabel,I would absolutely love to stay here again! Florence was great at communicating prior to us arriving and Jeff warmly received us the evening we got in. This space absolutely exceeded my expectations and was located at such a convenient location for our Monterey getaway! I would definitely recommend to anyone who is thinking of visiting the area
20171635,188826913,2017-08-30,53589081,Andrew,"Had a great stay here with my wife and our one year old.  Was in a great location- walkable to path along ocean, the aquarium, restaurants.  The view from the apartment was amazing too!  Would definitely return."
20171635,191250326,2017-09-06,82490830,Jennifer,"Merry was a fantastic host, easy to communicate with and quick to respond. It was easy to check in and out and the garage was a real bonus. The townhouse is absolutely beautiful with stunning views from both floors, a spacious kitchen, comfortable living space, and massive bedroom with a king size bed.  It was hard to say goodbye to this little home away from home! I hope to come and stay again sometime soon."
20171635,194364434,2017-09-16,145407548,Mark  Debbie,"The 2-level townhouse is fantastic, with amazing views from both balconies.  An excellent location, within an easy walk of downtown and many great restaurants.  We look forward to our next visit!"
20171635,200235647,2017-10-04,144269155,Megan,Beautiful condo! Beautiful views! Perfect location! This rental exceeded my excpectations. It is within a 30 minute walk to Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Balconies on the upper and lower level give you breathtaking views of the bay. Highly recommend.
20171635,201673383,2017-10-08,7167696,Erica,"Fantastic views, perfect location to walk downtown, and very well appointed. We had a very nice time here."
20171635,202325796,2017-10-10,12774369,Gina,"The place was just as described - a perfect getaway. Location was excellent - a short walk to shops, restaurants, the water. Great views from the place. Highly recommended."
20171635,203807683,2017-10-15,86017284,Rob,"This is an amazing unit tucked up on the hill overlooking the beautiful blue waters of Monterey Bay. Easy to park off street with your own garage. The house is modern, quiet and secure. Spotless inside and a huge comfy king bed to wake up in!
Walking distance to great coffee. The pick for us was Crema. Many delicious restaurants within walking distance. 
We did the aquarium on a Friday and it wasn’t busy. 
We would absolutely recommend this place and would stay there again and again."
20171635,209944803,2017-11-06,9281579,Anne-Marie,Amazing view in a quiet residential area. Place was clean and according to listing. Would book again!
20171635,211862685,2017-11-14,23891697,Tyler,The view speaks for itself. It’s even better in person. Merry was great to work with.  Very responsive to our questions. Check in and out was very easy. Will definitely stay here our next trip out.
20171635,214118845,2017-11-24,28707050,Valerie,Wonderfully located with a gorgeous ocean view.  The condo is modern and very comfortable.  Merry has paid attention to the little details that make for a marvelous stay!
20171635,214877626,2017-11-26,20707960,Laura,"Merry's place has tremendous views of Pacific Grove and the ocean. Big windows allow for ample light during the daytime. The balconies on both floors are wonderful -- great places to read or relax. I slept downstairs on the couch and was comfortable. The best part is that the condo is centrally located. Walking into town or Cannery Row to grab a bite or sightsee is easy, and attractions (like the Monterey Bay Aquarium or Point Pinos Lighthouse) are within 1-2 miles. I also enjoyed going for a run near 17-mile drive and down by the water. Checking in and out is a breeze, and there's a garage space for your car. 

Thanks, Merry! We really enjoyed our stay over the Thanksgiving holiday."
20171635,217520456,2017-12-09,51780195,Tiana,The view is spectacular!! Coffee in the morning on the balcony was just amazing. The place is clean and quiet. Merry was nice and replied quickly to us. We would definitely stay again!

20171635,221479681,2017-12-26,44466484,Mike,"Stayed with wife for 4 days. It's easy to drive to Carmel, 17Miles, Big Sur, Monterey, Santa Cruz. Pacific Groove is very quiet and charming. It feels less touristy than Monterey, althou its just a couple of mins walk to the aquarium. The were deer in the streets,  you could hear the sea lions from afar, very calm and pretty. 
The condo is spotless and very comfortable. The views are just amazing.

Thank you very much"
20171635,234138792,2018-02-11,14984997,Jose,"Great accommodations with breathtaking views of Monterey Bay. Within Uber-distance of Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey. The unit was immaculately clean, comfortable and felt like home the minute we walked inside. Oh, and the bedroom is huge with floor to ceiling windows facing the bay. You won't be disappointed and will be pining to return before you even check-out!"
20171635,235435499,2018-02-16,97394395,Jemmy,謝謝

Wish we could have stayed longer than two nights! 
It is very well equipped and has a great view at the sea."
20171635,241587376,2018-03-09,139416190,Kirsty,"We loved Merry’s place! The rooms are a great size and it had everything we needed. I loved relaxing on the balcony with a glass of bubbly looking out at the ocean!
We drove around as we had our one year old with us and this was a great base for getting down highway 1 and the 17 mile drive. 
Absolutely no complaints! Thanks for having us!"
20171635,242685599,2018-03-12,172913908,Bradley,"Staying here was so luxurious. The little things we forgot were already stocked and waiting for us. Easy tv/internet access. Majestic ocean view!  Close To Everything! Can’t wait to come back and do it all again. There’s no other place I’ll book, thank you Merry for making our get away everything we wished for and more!!!!"
20171635,243652927,2018-03-16,7614395,Kathleen,"We enjoyed Merry's condo with it's fantastic view and welcoming decor.  It it well stocked, very clean and comfortable.  It is also extremely quiet.  We would certainly stay here again."
20171635,245792329,2018-03-23,26275106,Dan,"This is the best Pacific Grove location there is. The bay views are much better than the photos indicate, and everything the area has to offer is 5-10 minutes away. Clean, quiet, gorgeous, and perfectly located. Can't ask for more than that."
20171635,248152058,2018-03-30,47355815,Kevin,This is an amazing home. The quiet neighborhood location is perfect for relaxing. The view of the bay is fantastic from the balconies as well as pretty much any spot inside. The space itself is great and thoughtfully appointed with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
20171635,254440185,2018-04-16,134595672,Greg,What a great place. View was just like pictures and all was very nice. Definitely recommend.
20190642,244513186,2018-03-18,6864595,Stephanie,"This is a really lovely little cottage that feels like it is right out of a story book! Very comfy bed and big spacious bathroom, lots of natural light. Michele is a great host and was very responsive and helpful. Perfect location, can't say enough good things! I highly recommend staying with Michele."
20190642,246636386,2018-03-25,122507335,Nancy,"We absolutely loved this little house, it looks like something straight out of Pinterest. It has a cute little living room with a fireplace and the bedroom has an extremely comfortable bed. The location is quiet and peaceful, a super quick drive to the aquarium. It's also walking distance to the beach, restaurants and coffee shops. We hope to stay here again someday."
20190642,247517571,2018-03-28,31557838,Stacie,Such a cute and cozy place close to everything! I would for sure stay here again! Michele was so flexible and great with responding! Absolutely loved our stay!
20190642,248572622,2018-03-31,54742686,Baylee,Great Location. Close enough to walk to Lovers Point Beach.
20190642,250965532,2018-04-06,41640827,Kathleen,"This cottage is absolutely delightful.  Stylish and well appointed.  Very nice and  spacious bath room.  Laundry was a great amenity.  Small kitchen with gas stove allows for involved cooking if you don't want to hit all the great restaurants in the area for every meal.  We prefer to stay in Pacific Grove when we visit the area and this is the BEST location we've ever stayed in.  We biked over to the aquarium, could walk to the oceanside walking path, and were just steps from downtown Pacific Grove.  The gas fireplace/heater made for cozy evenings.  Michelle was very responsive and helpful.  She even loaned us a bike lock!  Will stay again as soon as we can."
20190642,251842372,2018-04-08,55959102,Michael,"Really cute, private space in a great location. Walking distance to pretty much everything in downtown Pacific Grove and very short drive to Monterey / Canary Row / The Aquarium."
20190642,252479222,2018-04-10,146460106,George,"Michele was a great host, communication was easy and was always quick to respond with any question I had. The little bungalow was amazing, loved the little fireplace and she even left us some great coffee. The place was in a great friendly neighborhood with short driving distance of many great places Monterey has to offer. It was very comfy and cozy, and she had everything we needed for our stay. Thanks again Michele for having us."
20192720,182081083,2017-08-13,15766454,Barbara,"Close to shops and restaurants. Great family , very friendly . 10-15 minutes to everywhere I wanted to go."
20192720,187827726,2017-08-27,8420813,Bjorn,"Great cozy spot for an adult or two kids, Andrea and her family were welcoming and generous. The space was clean, comfortable, and convenient."
20192720,188803926,2017-08-30,32687306,Oliver,"If your visiting the area you'd be crazy not to stay here. 
The location is ideal, the room was very tidy and cosy.  The bed is what dreams are made of and when we did manage to pull ourselves out of bed there was home made scones and a fresh pot of coffee waiting for us! 
Andrea is such a lovely person which adds to her being such a super host! 
We would highly recommend."
20192720,189133006,2017-08-31,11277484,Matthew,I'd stay again with Andrea. The room and home were spotless and Andrea goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. I'd stay again for sure
20192720,190660915,2017-09-04,23005707,Aria,Andrea's place was even nicer than expected. Nice clean and comfortable room and bathroom. She also makes incredible smoothies!
20192720,191472191,2017-09-07,145864559,Jake,"Andrea was a wonderful and welcoming host! The home is lovely, in a superb location for visiting the local town, Monterey and Big Sur. She gave lots of advice for what to see, do and eat, and the cats were very friendly. Definitely recommend, and would stay again!"

20192720,201721111,2017-10-08,37169634,Adam,"Great accommodation within Pacific Grove. Within walking distance to local restaurants and public transport. Andrea was very hospitable, giving us advice about the local area. 

10/10"
20192720,208518912,2017-11-01,24492721,Fanny,"The room is super cozy, I loved the bed and the additional space on the top. Had a great and efficient portable radiator (so much better than a normal air conditioner which I usually do not use). Andrea and her harmonic family were super nice, she prepared some snacks for me in the morning. You will be essentially living with them and their cats, but you won't be bothered if you don't want to. Everything was very uncomplicated. Location is great to reach both Monterey and Asilomar trails, restaurants are within walking distance. Would definitely highly recommend to anyone and come back again."

20229668,215425227,2017-11-29,2230600,Karen,"Beautiful location walking distance to restaurants, shops and the coastal trail.  We stayed here for a day team meeting and used all the common spaces for various discussions.  We really enjoyed the back patio with heat lamp.  The house is cozy and comfortable."
20229668,245319650,2018-03-21,3588444,Drew,The barbecue and outdoor heater worked great even in the fog. This is a great place for groups!

20229670,161761406,2017-06-18,6331424,Annie,"This house is beautiful! My family and I came together for a celebration and could not have had a better time or space. Comfortable rooms for everyone, a great kitchen for lots of family meals, and easy walks down to the PG waterfront and shops. Thank you, Nan and Robert, for a wonderful visit! "
20229670,171496213,2017-07-17,1555196,Vajra,What a beautiful home! We felt so lucky to spend a long weekend gathered here. The little front yard was a haven for our children and the layout of the house was perfect for offering both communal and private space for our group. Nan and her husband are kind and helpful hosts. I couldn't recommend this home more!
20229670,187851911,2017-08-27,29638397,Sam,"This place is beautiful! Great location, great space."
20229670,244515047,2018-03-18,9542162,Sarah,What a fantastic house and location!  Our family had a great stay and love the area.
20229673,206087461,2017-10-23,54153817,Pete,Wonderful place to stay in Pacific Grove! Organization by owners was phenomenal. Very pleasant & easy to deal with. Would highly recommend!
20229673,213894171,2017-11-23,7397243,Jennifer,"This house was very cute.  I stayed with my family and my parents.  The wine and cheese upon arrival were nice.  There were a few things listed in welcome book that we didn’t see, like day use spa pass and extra sets of keys.  It was difficult to reach the host or rental company.  Messages were not responded to until our stay was almost over. Downstairs shower is very small.  You almost cannot turn around.  The location was great and parking was no problem.  A number of airbnbs in Pacific Grove offer 2 free aquarium guest passes.  This place did not offer that.  I come up to Pacific Grove yearly because it’s beautiful.  This house has a lot of potential and if the hosts or rental company can get the communication issue worked out, I think it will be great.  Oh, and a good reading light in the living room near some of the windows would be perfect."

20229693,188251588,2017-08-28,55276699,Wes,"The house was great. I would recommend staying here. 
As soon as we walked in we all felt at home. The decor and feel of the house was very welcoming especially as we had had a long drive getting there (The cheese and wine were particularly welcome)
Located in quiet and attractive  neighbourhood and 10 minutes walk from the aquarium."
20229693,230956422,2018-01-29,158269423,Lulu,"It's close to the beach, by walk in 10 mins. If you like to cooking in the house that's a wonderful place."
20229694,236605126,2018-02-19,3212262,Barbara,"We had an OUTSTANDING stay in Monterey. The home was immaculate and very well stocked. There was wine, cheese, and crackers to welcome us, plenty of towels in every bathroom, and the kitchen had spices and plenty of cooking supplies for our large family to utilize the kitchen and cook a meal together. This was the nicest and most well-stocked Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. There were even robes for guests! They made it feel just like a hotel. 
The location is also terrific. Minutes walking distance from the beach and a short drive from all Monterey, carmel, and Big sur attractions. 
If you are thinking of staying here, do it!! Would recommend it 10/10 and hope to come back next year!!"
20229695,230266642,2018-01-27,55954041,Chloe,Great location in very close proximity to beach and local commercial street. The home was perfect for our needs and very spacious. The kitchen was fully equipped which is great for those who like to cook. Highly reccommend!

20229699,146737841,2017-04-23,22299687,Chris,"Cute, charming and cozy (but plenty spacious) home in a great Pacific Grove neighborhood. This cottage was a nice home base for a few of us while we were in the area for an event. We'll happily stay here again. "
20229702,210916740,2017-11-11,54550924,Ashley,"The Sanctuary Rental was absolutely perfect! It's a gorgeous bnb and our hosts had a bottle of wine, cheese and crackers waiting for us upon our arrival. Check-in was painless and so easy. Communication all the days before were perfect, and we even had to call them on our last day there because the kitchen sink wouldn't properly drain and we were in fear of running the dishwasher. The kind lady I spoke with took care of us! The beds were so comfortable, the bathroom was immaculate, and the kitchen was beautiful stocked with all appliances and utensils. It was more than enough space for us and I will definitely stay here in the future. There was a detailed checkout list so there wasn't any confusion! The bnb does include a lovely patio area and a BBQ pit, which we did not use, but we did use the kitchen every morning we were there."

20229711,185465908,2017-08-21,126146755,Anne,Beautiful house in a perfect location-many thoughtful details provided by the host made this the perfect weekend vacation!
20229714,168947146,2017-07-10,132706642,Lisa,"My only reluctance in writing this review is that it will give you cause to raise your rates! My family and I loved staying at the Captain's Castle. Staying at the house is like walking back in time without losing any creature comforts. The view from the tower is quite lovely. We spotted whales, dolphins, seals and otters out in the bay. The location is fantastic, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Lovers Point Park are in walking distance. Tide pools across the street and a nature park next door help you appreciate the bounty of California's natural landscape. An added and unexpected bonus was the ability to park in the garage. The bed linens and towels are high quality, and I appreciated the free bottle of wine and cheese platter."
20229714,204133712,2017-10-16,14835687,Carolina,"Great location! Close to the hike/bike path off the bay.  I went for a college reunion, and everyone loved the castle. The homes decor is fabulous! Loved all the amenities that were provided."
20234455,224327083,2018-01-02,105293265,Wendy,The hostess tried to make my stay the nicest possible.
20234455,234467149,2018-02-12,93370379,Matt,This location provides great access between the highway and the coast.  Easy walking to stores and restaurants.
20268378,192975353,2017-09-11,6615983,Philipp,"It's a beautiful place, perfectly located. Larry and his wife were great hosts, always helpful and trying to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Thanks again for highlighting our trip."
20268378,193751864,2017-09-14,31841430,Tamara,"Larry made us feel very welcome. His place was spacious, clean and modern with a sea view and a lovely little sitting area outside. Close to the aquarium and restaurants. We would recommend his place if you are visiting the Monterey area."
20268378,194958491,2017-09-17,149486076,Monique,"Book this room without hesitation! Ocean view, very comfy bed, completely quiet, all new construction, private entrance, unconnected to other living spaces. Independent thermostat. Hot water in shower. Much better than expected, and we had a better sleep here than in the Portola downtown.

Host is friendly and helpful. 

Location is in the very quaint nor-cal town of Pacific Grove, home to fantastic victorians and adorable little shops. About a mile from Alvarado St. in downtown Monterey, but very convenient to Lighthouse Ave (it's at the end of the street!), so it's not an issue."
20268378,195551667,2017-09-19,62455709,Mika,"Amazing place, close to Cannery Row, with good parking. Larry is a wonderful host always looking for ways to make your stay even better. Private, quiet, and modern studio with all new furnishings. I will definitely be back if there is availability."
20268378,197146495,2017-09-24,30784581,Bridget,"Fabulous place! You park your car and are looking out to the sea!  And from the room you even have a view!  Larry has great taste so it is just lovely!  Great amenities, attention to detail, sweet little terrace.  Great coffee and treats left for you -- even a beautiful bottle of wine!  Private entrance is perfection.  Neighborhood lovely. And Larry immediately responded to any and all of my communications.  Great host, lovely place. Can't more highly recommend."
20268378,197992665,2017-09-27,20949293,India,Larry was a great host and the room had everything we could need. Good location for exploring Monterey and Carmel - would highly recommend.
20268378,200829315,2017-10-06,40323784,Bradford,"Larry was great, super nice. His place is very nice new and clean. Simple easy to check in and out. Close to Monterey, Carmel-by-the-sea and not far from Big Sur area too. Would recommend it to everyone."
20268378,202331612,2017-10-10,6255975,Joe,"Great place!  Location is walking distance to restaurants and shops and the beautiful coast.  Be forewarned, it's a hilly neighborhood (but it's also a very nice neighborhood).  Every one of Larry's recommendations was spot on.  Would definitely go back."
20268378,202760968,2017-10-12,21425317,Camilla,"We loved our stay at Casa Terraza.  The location was so convenient that we ended up walking to most of the places we wanted to see.  The room as cozy without being claustrophobic, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was easy to use with high end fixtures that regulated the water temp without us having to adjust it.  The bottle of wine awaiting us was a nice touch.  More importantly, Larry and Margot were friendly, considerate, and gracious host and hostess.  We will go back whenever we find that we needed to get our ocean fix."
20268378,204370894,2017-10-17,58165192,Barbara,"The amenities, comfort, cleanliness, hospitality, quietness, and  location is perfect!  Larry is a warm and wonderful host!  I am definitely going to go back again! In fact I am looking forward to it!! Definitely recommend it to anyone !! Thank you Larry!"
20268378,205819493,2017-10-22,86746638,Wayne,"From the moment we got there to the time we left, it felt like we were right at home. Larry was above and beyond what most hosts are like. Very warm and friendly introduction showing us our new oasis for the weekend. Larry went out of his way to put up a “happy birthday” sign for my girlfriend. The room had a great view of the ocean but still private from the house. The heated floors, shower, bed, and coffee were small touches that completed the room. Comfortable bed and pillows made it easy to fall right asleep. He even had a towel warmer! Prime location for walking to Cannery Row and if we wanted to head down to Carmel-by-the-Sea, it was only a fifteen minute drive. We will for sure be back in the summer to stay with Larry and Margot again!!"
20268378,206497023,2017-10-25,90594636,Mark,It was our anniversary and Larry had a nice bottle of wine for us. He greeted us at the curb and thoroughly explained everything to us. The room is private with a separate entrance which allowed for easy coming and going. The shower is amazing!  The little courtyard is cozy with a small view of the bay. The location was wonderful!
20268378,206976042,2017-10-27,39622171,Finnegan,"I highly recommend Larry's place.  Larry is a great, personable host and helpful as a local guide.  Larry provides useful local and regional maps as well as info sheets on restaurants and tourist venues.  The location was perfect for me as I enjoyed walking up and down steep hills to the waterfront.  I also had a car and street parking is plentiful and easy, if you're not inclined to walk.  I think Larry's place is best for a single guest (me) or cozy for two."
20268378,208031003,2017-10-30,4288955,Cuc,"Larry is an amazing host! He offered fabulous tips about the neighborhood! The room is nice and cozy, bed is super comfy! 

Loved our time in Pacific Grove!"
20268378,209966650,2017-11-06,140092801,Melanie,"We had a great time at CasaTerraza, Larry is the most generous host in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and we found there was a lot in common between us, motorbikes and kitty cats to be specific. The room was perfect with a modern bathroom, great shower (better than all the previous hotels we had stayed in) lots of cupboard space and so quiet so we slept really well. Larry supplies info on the area but the house is walkable to some great restaurants and Cannery Row with just a short drive to Fishermans Wharf. We would have loved to stay longer. Cannot recommend highly enough!!"
20268378,210491637,2017-11-09,57679648,Ayana,"Best Airbnb ever! Heated floors, huge shower, cozy bed and beautiful view. It doesn’t get any better than Larry’s place!"
20268378,211390670,2017-11-12,1529253,Jack,"We really enjoyed our stay at Larry's home.  He has done a great job in making the space comfortable and providing a first class experience for his guests.  The amenities and all furnishings are first-rate, the bath/shower is wonderful, and the location is easy walking distance to restaurants and the PG beach trail. The coffee selection was a treat, as was the lovely bottle of wine which we sipped on the outdoor patio.  Larry is a natural host and we appreciated all of his tips and great conversations. We look forward to a return visit.  Highly recommended."
20268378,211858207,2017-11-14,26932993,Angelia,Larry’s place was the perfect cozy beach getaway. It was furnished wonderfully and had impeccable finishes. Much better than a hotel with a delightful host.
20268378,213084312,2017-11-19,106866285,Marianna,"My boyfriend and I loved our time at Larry's Airbnb. We arrived late because of Bay Area traffic, and he was so welcoming! The space is clean, calming, and perfectly removed from hustle and bustle even though it's a few blocks from the waterfront. The SHOWER was probably the best part hahaha! We will definitely come back if we end up in Monterey again. Thank you Larry and Margot!!!"
20268378,213551173,2017-11-21,85552891,Kate,"Larry has a perfect little room with a view of the Monterey Bay. It’s within walking distance to everything— Lover’s Point, the Aquarium, Oceanview Blvd, you name it. Only a quick drive to Carmel By-the-Sea and easy to connect to 1 south. Quiet and private, Larry’s place was perfect for a quick trip for two."
20268378,214883881,2017-11-26,144579707,Alexandra,Great location and wonderful host! Highly recommend!
20268378,216422196,2017-12-03,2043330,Jenna,"One of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in! For the value, the room is amazing especially the bathroom. There’s a small fridge, electric kettle, and coffee maker in the room, and they have a great selection of coffees and will bring you cream if you need it. Definitely use Larry’s restaurant suggestions because we had delicious food the whole time following those. We will definitely stay here again if it’s available and we’re back in the Monterey area!"
20268378,216785256,2017-12-05,963004,Michael,"We travel to the Monterey area often and have stayed in many different places. Larry and Margo's place is the best we have found. Everything was wonderful: location, comfort, value, and a great welcome. Will definitely return."
20268378,218011843,2017-12-10,1748624,Daniel,"Larry's place is wonderful. Cozy, stays warm really well, and Larry himself is very kind. He was ready at the place to give us a tour, showed us around the rooms, and even surprisingly gave us a bottle of wine to start off our great weekend. Would definitely recommend "
20268378,219731031,2017-12-18,49058196,Zunaid,"Larry and Larry’s place are both equally enchanting. Larry is kind and caring and his place reflects this. He is prompt, always available and the place is really great value for money which is also well situated."
20268378,220309950,2017-12-21,10781632,Wen Yi,"We stayed at Larry’s place for two nights and absolutely loved it! The space is incredibly thoughtfully furnished + well-equipped, and is also really cozy. It’s off the side of the main house, as described, and it felt like we had the whole space to ourselves. 

This was our first time in Monterey and we definitely appreciated the list of local tips he gave as well. 

This has to be one of my favorite Airbnb stays ever and if I’m in the Monterey region again, I’d definitely rebook in a heartbeat :)"
20268378,221209007,2017-12-25,5146542,Thu,"This studio had everything we needed and more. We especially loved how modern, luxurious and clean the space was. The special touches with the bottle of wine and champagne did not go unnoticed even though we didn’t get a chance to enjoy them due to all the holiday gorging with family. Larry was super friendly and welcoming when we arrived too. I just wish we could’ve stayed longer to explore all the scenery and sights within walking distance. Next time."
20268378,223128176,2017-12-31,28585737,Gulliver,Great spot! You will love it and Larry is a great host!
20268378,224333453,2018-01-02,27408599,Anna,"Pictures do not do Larry's place justice. The space is small, cozy, and the quality and cleanliness are superb. This is perfect getaway as a single person or as a couple if you are exploring Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, or the Big Sur. 

It is a short walk down to the water. We walked to dinner at Cannery Row then to breakfast the next day in Pacific Grove. We spent most of our weekend hiking, but if that is not your thing this location is a short walk to the Monterey Aquarium, shops at Cannery Row, downtown Pacific Grove, restaurants, and a great running/biking path where there are distractions like sea otters that might affect your exercise routine (as in I couldn't stop watching them play). 

Larry is a SUPER HOST to say the least. He welcomed us and gave us the rundown on the room as well as the area. We were so impressed with all the care to details he is taking as he continues to design this space for guests. We were here for New Years 2018. Larry left us champagne and toffee which was an extra nice treat. Definitely Would Stay Again."
20268378,225493843,2018-01-06,39655655,Jane,"Larry was so nice, gave us pointers and places to go eat and do in and around Pacific Grove. Loved the coffee, tea and he so nicely gave us extra tissues and cold medicine. ( my daughter was sick during our stay) No T.V. but enjoyed a few games of backgammon and scrabble and reading his Atlas Obscura book, good quality time together!!! Thank you Larry!"
20268378,226080432,2018-01-08,31618277,Garrett,"Larry came out to great us on arrival. Left us some wine, fruit, and water. Great host and location."
20268378,226617832,2018-01-11,107156451,Roxane,Perfect place if you’re looking for a room near Cannery Row and beaches! Larry provided a beautiful room and bathroom.
20268378,227438699,2018-01-14,19151419,Teddy,Couldn't be better!
20268378,229823233,2018-01-25,43686910,Ali,"In my opinion, one of the best Air BnB’s I’ve stayed in. The private entrance, the heated floors, tea kettle, shower, easy parking, all made it a great stay."
20268378,231969130,2018-02-03,37519922,Gretchen,"Best airbnb experience ever. Over the top. And Larry has good suggestions for restaurants,  etc?"
20268378,236897556,2018-02-20,62267861,Ali,"I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to Monterey! It was the perfect spot for a weekend trip. Larry was a great host, very friendly and accommodating. The location is quiet and easily walkable. Hopefully will make it back soon!"
20268378,247814218,2018-03-29,39367006,Alena,Larry’s place was so nice that we immediately regretted not booking more days there. The location is perfect and 15 minutes max from everything this wonderful peninsula has to offer. Larry was kind enough to show us how everything worked in the suite and give some tips for some great places to visit in the area and for our drive to Big Sur. Super comfortable and lovely stay.
20268378,248568938,2018-03-31,82320876,Emily,"My partner and I both really enjoyed our time here. It was a perfect location, great price, and awesome hosts as well! We will definitely be back. Beautiful room. Very well done."
20268378,250624468,2018-04-05,20957542,Diana,"Larry’s place was a perfect place for our Monterey, Carmel, and Big Sur vacation. We were pleasantly surprised with the treats waiting for us in the little kitchenette. It was so convenient to have a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and water dispenser all in the room! It was a spacious and calming room. Larry was extremely helpful and informative regarding the amenities in the room and the neighboring cities. We are so pleased with the attention to detail that Larry has given to this room, it was definitely an AirBnB to remember !"
20268378,251926483,2018-04-08,3333293,Lou,"Pictures don't do this place justice. Perfect spot for a stay in the Monterey Peninsula. Modern, clean and elegant furnishings, terrific communication (above and beyond) and more. Highly recommended."
20268378,254127432,2018-04-15,1801260,Holly,"Larry's place was absolutely perfect for a weekend stay in Monterey. It was perfectly clean, thoughtfully appointed, very comfortable, and we barely had to drive due to the extremely convenient location. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to the aquarium. Larry himself was the best host and super friendly and hospitable. The room itself was super cool. I can't recommend this place more highly. Thank you!"
20268378,255481978,2018-04-20,32659457,Stephen,"Fantastic place, it had everything and then some. Highly recommended"
20279454,185099424,2017-08-20,144798653,Will,"Great place, my 11 year old son and I spent the long weekend for Car Week in the area. Cute little studio apartment in the back yard, plenty private. Great location in a quiet part of town, but still right near the main strip of Pacific Grove and close to everything else around. Nicely organized checkin, and good communication the whole time. Janet was super nice, would recommend it."
20279454,227705267,2018-01-15,22290130,Anna,"The apartment didn’t feel like a studio at all to us. It is spacious and well-designed to give a sense of open/airiness. We found it very peaceful and relaxing to stay here. 

Brian and Janet are also wonderful hosts. It was easy to find and get into the apartment, and they checked on us regularly to ensure we had anything we needed. We will certainly stay with them again next time we’re in Monterey!"
20279454,230979116,2018-01-29,38600867,Stephanie,"The little blue studio was so great that I wish I didn’t feel obligated to write a glowing review, so that I could keep it a secret. Brian, Janet and family were welcoming and the space was lovely, conveniently located, and sparkling clean. We are already contemplating making a return trip. "
20358036,202741161,2017-10-12,4107277,Celena,This suite is perfect for a romantic getaway. We totally felt like we had privacy and Katy was quick to respond to questions and concerns. The space itself was very clean and big! The bed was comfortable and I think the value was outstanding. Would stay again and I recommend at least a week in this area
20358036,206093833,2017-10-23,56408639,Susann,"I can't say enough great things about my stay.  Amazing communication as the trip approached and a great multiple page list of what to do while in the area   Great space both inside and outside in the yard.  Walking distance to the lighthouse and the most incredible sunsets.   Pacific grove is a lovely quiet residential area perfectly located for a drive to big sur, the 17 mile drive or over the Monterrey or Carmel."
20358036,207760868,2017-10-29,27604055,Rachel,"The space was a perfect retreat for a quiet get away with the perfect proximity to both Monterey, the ocean, and Carmel. Katy was wonderful with communication and met our needs very well and quickly. We enjoyed this little spot very much."
20358036,211348523,2017-11-12,54985141,Donna,"Katy’s place is beautiful, and in the perfect location for navigating the Monterey Bay Area. Close to the ocean and many great attractions. She really made our stay comfortable and gave us lots of great recommendations for our visit. Would definitely stay again - looking forward to it. Thanks Katy!"
20358036,213553213,2017-11-21,43446182,Lindsay,"Well, this review is a rave-Katy's place in Pacific Grove may be the best kept secret on the Peninsula. 
Firstly, even though the unit is attached to their home, it really remains a private space with a private entrance and outdoor space. I could not hear conversations through walls or televisions; it was extremely quiet. 
Being familiar with the area, I also recommend this area of Pacific Grove which is dotted with green spaces and integrated golf course greens with grazing deer, and it helps their house is a two minute walk to the ocean. You can hop on a bike and ride right on to 17 Mile Drive. Stop in Spanish Bay on your return and have drinks outside at Roy's overlooking the ocean. You can still walk to town from their home while enjoying the less congested part of PG. I also took Uber's at night into Carmel which were very accessible and under 15$. (Don't miss PassionFish in Pacific Grove if you are a seafood fan. I also recommend the Grove Market in PG: well stocked, affordable and friendly.)
The space itself is thoughtfully laid out, very functional and serenely pretty. They have fire places and smart TVs in the bedroom and living room. I had very restful sleeps in the huge bed and enjoyed nice baths and rain showers. The bathroom also has nice lighting and a good amount of storage.  Katy is great with response time to boot. 
I can't wait to stay again."
20358036,214378757,2017-11-25,76802897,Connie,"Katy's place is in the perfect location for all the great tourist attractions and unprecedented ocean beauty. The accommodations were spacious and clean. You get a great patio, living room, bathroom and dining area for a wonderful price. The bed was top notch. I think I slept better in that bed, than my own bed at home. An added bonus was the beautiful deer each morning. I cant say enough good things about our stay!!"
20358036,218750475,2017-12-14,159042967,Chris,"Excellent location, incredibly helpful suggestions for local activities, very clean space, very comfortable bed, and one of the most beautiful regions in the country!"
20358036,227707857,2018-01-15,162855458,Janelle,"I have not been on a vacation in over 10 years, and I could not have picked a better place to stay! The space is cozy and inviting while being modern and quite fashionable. I loved how private the stay was, although Katy was available when I had a question or comment. Katy provided all the necessities and there were more amenities and pleasant surprises than I had expected. 
The place is located only blocks from the scenic coastal trail that takes you all the way into Monterey's Cannery Row. Sunsets from the trail are breathtaking to say the least. And even when you aren't outside of the space you can still hear the soft murmur of the waves through the quiet neighborhood, which adds greatly to the relaxing ambiance of the space. 
Overall, I would recommend Katy's place to anyone who is looking for a nice and quiet spot in a great location that is both far away enough to be a getaway but close enough to everything to be a destination. I would definitely stay again for my next vacation!"
20358036,234175620,2018-02-11,165168940,Heidi,"The house was beautiful and private. My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway, kid free! It was great and very quiet place to stay. The king size bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a spa like feel with rain fall shower head, the coffee was delicious and the host, Katy, was very responsive! I am allergic to real down, so I requested for the down comforter not be put on the bed.  I forgot to bring my own blanket, like I said I would. I contacted Katy, when we were on the way and she graciously added a comforter and some blankets to the bed. Then she went beyond that and bought a brand new down alternative comforter. Katy was very sweet and a great host! We will definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this place!"
20358036,235175335,2018-02-15,3133276,Lloyd,"I didn't particularly enjoy my stay here. 

Pros: beautiful area, very nice suite with good proximity to town.

Cons: I work in a highly regulated industry. I am used to following rules. I have never seen as many conditions / restrictions on guests as here; I've signed employment contracts shorter than the house rules! If you want to do outrageous things like talk outside after 8pm (this is a real rule!) you should consider booking elsewhere. For me at least, this took a lot of the shine off the trip - should I really need to consult sub-paragraph 5 of the document I was emailed to see if I can do something on vacation?"
20358036,236891183,2018-02-20,31719555,Mike,"Great communication with the host, great place, has everything you need, very clean, excellent location, less that 5 minute walk to the coast where you will love the walks along the trails. About a 40 minute walk (might be longer since you will be stopping and taking lots of pictures) to the aquarium but it won't feel long as the views along the coast line our spectacular."
20358036,241126334,2018-03-07,172539801,Nancy,"This was my first airbnb experience and I was thoroughly satisfied: lovely location, spacious clean and comfy accommodations, easy communication with owner, and low cost to boot.  I would stay here again and again."
20358036,243643236,2018-03-16,3392555,Zack,"We’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s and this was among the best. Outstanding location on a quiet street an easy walk to the ocean. Convenient parking. Large living space, very comfortable. Great king size bed. Wonderful patio with nice furniture that we weren’t able to use due to the wet weather. Communication from Katy was superb. We highly recommend Katy’s place if you are staying anywhere in the Monterey area."
20361891,192657418,2017-09-10,147797351,Evelyn,Darling little house. Clean and very comfortable. Great location. Great bathroom and kitchen
20361891,199360585,2017-10-01,9558421,Shoney,"We loved it here! What a great location. This is a wonderful vintage house with so much personality in a neighborhood of fantastic homes and just blocks from Lover's Point, the ocean, harbor seals and sweet sea breezes.
It was so quiet we were able to sleep and rise early for a beautiful walk along the beach. It is also a very close walk to town and lots of great places to eat and coffee shops. What a lovely place!"
20361891,202093113,2017-10-09,4648972,Anthony,"This is a great little house in a good location that served us well.  Other than being completely devoid of tissues, there were no issues with the property and we enjoyed our stay.

It's becoming more common on Airbnb, but this is a corporate owned or managed property.  To us this takes away from the platform. We didn't meet anyone named Debra.  She may indeed be the owner, but we have no way of knowing that.  Learning about Debra through the Airbnb Profile played a roll in the booking.  Additionally, we would have loved to had a dialog with her regarding her travels.  Ultimately, when we picked up our keys at Monterey Bay Property Management offices we were referred to two other individuals that were designated 'Property Managers'.  While the property was as advertised, we missed the intimacy of Airbnb."
20361891,203274056,2017-10-14,19669302,Toby,"Beautiful house a couple of minutes from the sea, and a short walk along the coast to Monterey. Highly recommended!"
20361891,204565761,2017-10-18,16489059,Charlie,"Gorgeous house in a great location. 
However;
no personal touch at all, with no information regarding the surrounding area or places to eat / drink etc. 
Quite militant cleaning rules despite high cleaning fees. 
Advertised as family friendly but not infant/toddler friendly in view of steep staircase with big gaps in banisters and no door to upstairs child bedroom. 
Overall we had a fabulous stay in a great neighbourhood with super friendly neighbours but would alter the above."
20361891,207244333,2017-10-28,747625,Nuala,"The house was perfect for our weekend in Monterey / Pacific Grove. It is very central and we could easily walk to restaurants and the beach. Check in was very smooth and everything was perfect when we arrived. The house is adorable, I highly recommend staying here!"
20361891,214859981,2017-11-26,9756156,Julie,We had a great time!
20361891,225513006,2018-01-06,13245958,Alan,"This property is in a great location; 1 block to beach and town. Quiet neighborhood. Well maintained, clean and well equipped house. Exorbitant cleaning fee. 

I rated a ‘3’ because of interaction with property company and checkin process. They did not understand that Airbnb would make the payment after guests checked in. They wanted the payment in advance and refused to give me the keys. I had to contact Airbnb to sort it out. A major hassle which delayed us getting into house and wasn’t a relaxing way to start our weekend.

We’ve rented through Airbnb several times and this wasn’t the experience we’re accustomed. Units from property companies shouldn’t be listed."
20361891,227701518,2018-01-15,4463324,Dan,If you don't have a Grandmother who lives 1 block from Lover's Point - this is the closest you can get to that idilic. Yes the home is pokey and some of the doors aren't flush but that was part of the charm for us. We managed it with a 2 year old and by the end of the second day she was on the look out for 'sweet pea' whenever we headed back from the beach.
20361891,233464803,2018-02-09,148985032,Carla,"We loved the location, could walk to the beach, close to aquarium, very comfortable Victorian.  When I had a minor problem with learning how to work the TV, they were there in 15 minutes.  When I had a little issue with a faucet, repair man came when we were out having fun and fixed the problem."
20361891,237946719,2018-02-24,13868333,Melissa,"This place is so centrally located! Two blocks to the water or downtown Pacific Grove. Cozy gas fireplace. The fireplace in the front room was the only source of heat on the ground floor, which was a little odd. We had a good time!"
20361891,250054097,2018-04-03,8613571,Nimar,"Very cute cottage close to Lover's Point Beach, (Just a five minutes walk), which has a number of activity rentals available -- kayaking, bicycles etc."
20361891,251888162,2018-04-08,7125972,New,"The house is lovely.  It is cozy and clean and tasteful.  The hosts laid the table for our arrival.  there is a lovely gas fire for rainy days.  the street is quiet, close to the beach and all the shops and restaurants.  A wonderful experience.

20407569,187872987,2017-08-27,25066433,Sara,"100% fantastic! There were four of us including my elderly mom who stayed at Steven and Tracie's place. It was perfect. My mom was able to stay in one of the bedrooms downstairs, avoiding having to go upstairs. The home was spotless, spacious and had everything one would ever need. There are lots of windows that when open provide perfect light and when one looks through the windows you get to see different colored flowers. The upstairs bedroom is lovely with big window and far reaching views. Close to the beach, aquarium and downtown!  I highly recommend this home to others. We were incredibly pleased and will be back!"

The hospitality was warm and welcoming, and the communication was fast and thorough. There were air mattresses to fit more people if needed. The bathrooms and towels were clean. The only thing that was unfortunate was the heater. We could not get it to work, so the upstairs was cold. Other than that, the trip and house was awesome! I definitely recommend it and I would stay there again."

Great location, clean, comfortable, and relaxing with a well written and helpful info binder full of tips and local info about restaurants (with a few menus!) and attractions. Our kids (ages 7, 4, and 18 months) loved staying here near the beach and aquarium and are asking when they can come back. Great bonuses: a baby gate for the stairs, extra high quality air mattresses, and aquarium guest pass!"

Awesome floorplan with 3 bedrooms separated quite well from each other, which was a great plus with kids who have different bedtimes and wake times. Kitchen is stocked with coffee, tea and cooking supplies. Great communication from Steven and Tracie about check-in, and a nice binder at the house with a lot of great information."
20407569,251917072,2018-04-08,1821900,Suzanna,"Beautiful home, very safe and quiet neighborhood, centrally located in Pacific grove a short walk to the scenic walk along lighthouse Ave. Steven and Tracie were perfectly communicative and excellent hosts. I especially liked the extra touches like Keurig pods (although we brought our own coffee) as well as the opportunity to use their annual passes to the aquarium. Very cool! Will definitely return."

Had a bit of unusually high temps for a day or two so not having A/C was a very minor inconvenience as by night temps where very comfortable. Older home with older home quirks that some see charming and some might not like. We enjoyed ourselves."

21001580,231525581,2018-02-01,84809812,Denise,"Amazing beach house. Everything was as Stated. Beautiful, clean and cozy beach house that is close to a variety of things, Restaurants within walking distance, fisherman’s warf close by with whale watching cruise available (3 hours approx) and worth it! We had the opportunity to see some beautiful grey whales along their migration route between Monterey and Big Sur!   Don’t forget the 17 mile drive there are amazing sites and beaches to stop at, relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery.  For those interested in hiking drive just under an hour to Santa Cruz and visit Henry Cowell state park and see beautiful redwoods the tallest 270ft! And walk along the San Lorenzo river.  Then stop for a bite to eat with the locals at the cowboy 
Thank you again Joy for having us, we had an amazing stay at your beach house!"

21001580,234155532,2018-02-11,25149827,Colleen,"My boyfriend and I did a romantic weekend in Monterey. We loved how close it was to the aquarium and beaches - perfect for a valentines day weekend. This cute little place was just right for us. The kitchen has everything to cook simple dinners and breakfasts. It was a bit hard to warm up the place with just the fireplace, but Joy had these amazing blankets to keep us warm. Did not detract from the place though. We will be back for our weekend in Monterey."

Joy was an amazing host had a beautiful home would not think twice about going again. Walking distance from beach and other shops nearby if you're looking for a place to relax and feel like a home away from home would strongly recommend staying at Joy's beautiful home."
21001580,247510712,2018-03-28,168668875,Lorraine,"Very beautiful and quite place to stay. Everything was very clean and welcoming upon our arrival.

21001580,250307201,2018-04-04,165920564,Maxwell,"A very quaint little cottage tucked beside a school in beautiful Monterey, CA. Joy's place is in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Although the beach wasn't as close as I was hoping, it's just a short walk away! I did utilize the washer and dryer available, and being able to watch Netflix on the TV came in handy. Overall this is a great spot for a cozy getaway!"

Judy is very quick to respond to any concerns or questions. She also has a wonderful array of amenities including coffee, water, chocolates, and she even provided us with mini ice creams in the freezer. I would highly recommend staying with Judy and plan on staying with her again if possible when we come back to Monterey."
21009015,203021617,2017-10-13,120211122,Kate,"Wow, what a gem! If you are going to be in the Monterey/Carmel area, Judy’s is the place to stay. The private unit is very spacious, clean and bright. It’s conveniently located to anything you’d want to see in the area. The two bedrooms are huge with very comfortable beds. Judy had put so much though into her guests’ experience and there are thoughtful touches throughout. She even surprised us with guest passes to the aquarium which was a total delight! It was just my mom and me when we stayed, but the unit is so spacious it would be very comfortable for two couples. We’ll be back!"

21009015,209703415,2017-11-05,3832768,Sarah,"Out of all of our wonderful AirBnb experiences, this one really stands out. Not only was the place beautiful, clean, and homey, but Judy went above and beyond in providing the perfect recommendations and accommodations for our special occasion. I am already recommending this listing to my friends and family, even though no one I know is currently planning a trip to Monterey. It was convenient and spacious, and it was truly our pleasure to be your guests! Thank you."
21009015,209955702,2017-11-06,114572326,Mmahan523,This place is exactly what it says it is. Great location near everything. Judy is awesome she has a sheet with great local restaurants and guest passes to the aquarium minutes away.  The place is very nice and quaint. Had a good heater for the chilly evenings. The place is worth it for sure. Would stay here again.
21009015,210923090,2017-11-11,82186950,Austin,"Judy’s place was our first AirBnB stay. She set quite a high standard for our future stays. Judy was very responsive, making checking in and out a breeze. Her attention to detail was outstanding. There were drinks, snacks (even ice cream), guidebooks and a list of personal recommendations available when we arrived. Judy left Post-It notes around the apartment-like little reminders from a dear friend.

We would absolutely stay at Judy’s again and plan to recommend to family and friends."
21009015,211861756,2017-11-14,303494,Eric,"Judy's place is such a gem.  There are so many great things about it, I'll try to count just some of them: 1) easy to get to; 2) close to the Cannery Row and other attractions; 3) spacious; 4) really clean; 5) tastefully decorated; 6) guest passes to the Aquarium (that will save you quite some money); 7) covered car port right at the foot of the stairs; 8) easy check in and check out; and 9) complimentary ice cream and fruits.  Most of them you see in the listing, still you will be pleasantly surprised once you get there.  Judy is a meticulous host, even though I didn't get to meet her, but her attention to details showed throughout, and she's a very responsive host.  I hope one day she gets to be a Superhost, and if I'm ever back again, I will definitely stay there, even on a solo trip.  It's that good."

Plenty of natural sunlight and views. Everything was clean and organized.

21009015,251349542,2018-04-07,65812630,Angelika,Most comfortable beds ever and beautiful view. WiFi is not very fast but if you want a quiet retreat this is great. The house is super clean and lovely.

21142337,204366204,2017-10-17,8901788,Christine & Perry,"Lee was so generous and helpful to us while we were evacuated from our home in Napa Valley due to the fires. This house is awesome-very  clean, comfy, beautifully decorated. Our family of 4 felt safe and at home during a stressful time. The house is in an awesome location. We walked to the beach, to town for dinner and  to the aquarium. We can’t wait to come back and visit. Thanks again, Lee- you went above and beyond for our family and we are forever thankful for you."
21142337,209740856,2017-11-05,155161304,Krista,"The house was so beautiful, comfortable, and fun - the perfect size for our four person getaway weekend.  It was very tastefully decorated, and had all the amenities we could hope for. The central location in Pacific Grove is amazing - so close to beaches/restaurants/parks and Monterey.  Lee was very responsive and helpful when we had any questions, and everything was very easy.  I would highly recommend this place and would definitely book it again!"
21142337,214843724,2017-11-26,24809099,Akiko,"This house is absolutely perfect in every way. Everything is the house is brand new, immaculately clean, and decorated very tastefully. The beds are very comfortable and the house is the perfect size for a family of 4-5. Lee is very accommodating and generously has bikes to use and 2 guest passes for the aquarium. Although we ate out for all our meals to numerous excellent restaurants within walking distance, the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you would need to make a feast. 
We really lucked out with this house as we did not know the area well. It is literally in the best location you could be in Monterey. One block from all the great restaurants and stores on Lighthouse. A few blocks away from the bike path, which is just a quick bike ride from the house. The entrance to 17 mile drive is just a few blocks up the opposite direction. We really fell in love in this town and look forward to coming back and staying at this house."
21142337,234156763,2018-02-11,16664799,Brad,"I rented this place with my wife and parents who were in town for the Pebble Beach tournament. It was our first time to Pacific Grove so we really had no idea what to expect.

Everything about the location and house itself was beyond our expectations! The house is a minute's walk from Lighthouse Avenue where all the restaurants and stores are.  It's also only a 10 minute drive from Pebble Beach which was perfect.

Best of all was the house itself - it's  tastefully decorated, well maintained and a stunning, comfortable home. We were constantly remarking at what great design touches were used in the home.

Whenever we're back in Pacific Grove we'll be heading back here!"
21142337,236232680,2018-02-18,59327648,Sarah,"Lee has a beautiful place, and was an attentive and thoughtful host. He gave wonderful recommendations for the area, even tipping my parents off to an open mic that Friday. We were within walking distance of the Aquarium (1 mile and some change), which helped us avoid some of the parking challenges of Cannery Row and Fisherman's Wharf.  I would definitely come back!"
21142337,237901461,2018-02-24,20171913,Eric,"The location is very good.   It's an easy walk to Lighthouse Ave which has many tasty eating spots and interesting window shopping.    There is also a popular kid's park, with all the standard play equipment, within easy walking distance. 

The house itself was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood.     Upstairs bedroom gets a lot of light but the downstairs bedroom can be darkened so our younger child didn't have any issues napping there.    There is a good amount of counter space and the kitchen is a good size so it was pretty easy to prepare meals there even with two people cooking. 

There were some issues with the floor heater on the first night but Lee was quick to provide us with space heaters which did a good job of keeping the place warm. 

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and we would stay here again."
21142337,246099853,2018-03-24,177420027,Sean,Felt like we were in our own home. Appreciated the games for kids and other ammenities. Lots within walking distance
21142337,246925588,2018-03-26,65804733,Diane,Lee’s home was very comfortable and had recently been remodeled. The master suite and bath were great. The house was super clean and had all the amenities needed for a family. It was only about five minutes by car to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and about the same distance to the 17 mile drive. Great location and very responsive host.
21142337,248142110,2018-03-30,64567620,Chad,"Lee’s Pacific Grove home is beautiful and is a convenient location for walking to the aquarium, restaurants and the ocean. The home was spotless, had a great grill and kitchen for cooking, and beds were very comfortable. We were a family of five that included teenagers and we had a blast. We’d love to return. Thanks so much."
21142337,250332855,2018-04-04,13155732,Schell,"Lee's house in Pacific Grove is very close to being my dream house. It's a gorgeous house, tastefully decorated, wishing very easy walking distance (slight hill) to delicious restaurants. It is also conveniently located very close to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, with two complimentary guest passes! The beds and pillows were very comfortable, with luxe throw blankets. There are many thoughtful touches and amenities. The master bedroom and bathroom (upstairs) were amazing. I hesitate to give this all of the high praise that it deserves, as I don't want it to be booked up when we return! Lee was very prompt and polite with communication, and is a great host."

 The home is just so lovely from top to bottom and in every nook and cranny- the backyard is sweet and the balcony off the master bedroom is ""zen"" in every definition of the word!
   Our family of four had a wonderful time-Lee was quick to respond with all of our questions and was gracious enough to let us check in a few hours early so we could get a full day at the aquarium!
  The home is spotless and so very comfortable! Thank you Lee for sharing a bit a heaven with us!!!"

21981955,238461362,2018-02-25,1356727,S.E.,"The Sunset Inn is a wonderful place to stay in a quiet neighborhood just steps from the beach walkway around Asilomar.  Just perfect!  Rishi & all his employees go above and beyond with hospitality - even getting flowers to help us celebrate our BabyMoon :).  We visit the area every couple of months and will definitely return.   ProTip. There is a fridge in the room with a compressor that cycles on during the night - if this hum bothers you, simply unplug before you go to bed.  Easy!"

21981955,241122800,2018-03-07,176916752,Rickey,This place was a cozy little escape right near the beach. The host was very accomadating and will work to ensure the best experience.
21981955,242381530,2018-03-11,10449982,Sarah,"Very cute hotel that is within walking distance of the Asilomar conference center. The micro fridge was very useful and the room was cleaned daily! Definitely need ear plugs though if you are a light sleeper, the walls don’t have much for noise insulation."
21981955,242710445,2018-03-12,78799816,Alexander,Rishi made us feel very welcomed and appreciated. Our room met all our needs and our early checkout was easily accommodated.
21981955,242893297,2018-03-13,62399793,Anthony,"Rishi and his staff were super accommodating, kind, and friendly. The location was superb and the room was awesome! So nice! We will be back!"
21981955,244518625,2018-03-18,141907524,Juriana,Clean and friendly staff. Location was great...15 minutes from Downtown and walking distance to the beach. Got to the location earlier than expected and was able to check in early. Highly recommend this place. I would stay here again.
21981955,246925447,2018-03-26,24167946,Ulrike,"We loved staying at this inn -- perfect location in Pacific Grove, the staff is super friendly, breakfast and happy hour for free, outside fireplace, great rooms... what more can you wish for in paradise?"
21981955,250074035,2018-04-03,167208750,Robert,"Comfortable and clean. Location is excellent, just a short walk from the beach."
21981955,250627885,2018-04-05,54858116,Caitlin,"A short but lovely stay! Sunset Inn was beautiful and a great place to stay in Pacific Grove! Very convenient to the surrounding area. Rishi was very accommodating, the room was perfect, would absolutely recommend!"
22048463,131591487,2017-02-12,112774519,Leslie,"We really enjoyed our visit to Pacific Jewel.  The home was very clean, cozy and comfortable - with plenty of space for our family of four.  We loved the location - the home was centrally located and convenient to Pacific Grove, Monterey and Carmel.  We also appreciated the easy access to the beach which was perfect for our morning walks with our dog. Our host was very accommodating and quickly responded to any questions we had. We will definitely come back and look forward to staying at the Pacific Jewel again!"
22048463,133145125,2017-02-20,11635476,Max,We had a wonderful time in Carmel and the AirBnB was great.
22048463,134290960,2017-02-26,19742750,Astrid,"Beautiful and comfortable house, with a great garden and a barbecue! The house is very close to the sea abd MaryJane was very responsive. I recommand you to go there. "
22048463,136964855,2017-03-12,113103098,Amber,Beautiful home. Convenient location. Excellent service.
22048463,139883344,2017-03-26,1756685,Arthur,"Wonderful stay with family
Convienent to eat and prepare meals together. Great walks nearby. Very helpful when we had difficulties such as locking ourselves out of the how. Couldn't ask for more."
22048463,140766639,2017-03-31,8276533,Joanna,"This house is in a great location (we were attending a conference at Asilomar) with all the amenities needed to eat breakfasts and lunches in (including a gas grill). Check in and check out were easy. The house has great views and plenty of space (we were four adult colleagues and the house easily accommodated all of us and we could have added 1-2 more people). The only downside was the cost once local taxes and cleaning fee were added in, but it was still reasonable for the area."
22048463,141337791,2017-04-02,13388227,Josephine,"We spent a lovely weekend in Pacific Grove and the house comfortably accommodated 3 couples.  The kitchen was well equipped for meal making and the living room sat all of us very comfortably.  Neighbors were friendly.  The house is about a 15 minute walk to the beach, and a quick 5 minute drive to shops and restaurants. 

Mary Jane, the host, was responsive and accomodating.  She gave us all the privacy we wanted but always managed to keep in communication when needed. The perfect host!

We will be back."
22048463,141942365,2017-04-05,9913231,Alexei,A very clean and well organized cottage with a detached room. Everything worked as advertised.
22048463,142537264,2017-04-08,23759555,Jackie,"This house was much more than I expected. Great large yard (although we had rain half of our stay so didn't really go outside). The beds were very comfortable. The other plus that I didn't know about or must have missed is that one of the bedrooms/baths is separated from the main part of the house. That was really cool. MaryJane was an excellent host, I would definitely stay here again. "
22048463,143199636,2017-04-10,47800356,Anurag,"We stayed at 3 separate Air bnb/Home Away locations on our 10 day trip to california. This property was by far our favorite. The house has been completed remodeled interiorly and everything is clean/modern. Furniture wise is well appointed but not cluttered.  The family room space is large and the dining area seats 8 adults comfortably. The bathrooms are surgically sterile/clean, the kitchen is of reasonable size and is well supplied.

We had one issue with heating in the attached guest host but they resolved the issue within 12 hours of contact. The location of the house is in walking distance of the butterfly sanctuary and a .5-.75 mile run to Lovers Park which is simply amazing. 

If we were to stay in Monterrey again, we would stay here."
22048463,145293187,2017-04-17,48769204,George,"Pacific Grove is a really great home.  We stayed for three nights, six adults, with a dog.  The garden is fully enclosed which is perfect.
Bedrooms and bathrooms are lovely.  Living space was perfect for the six of us, and the kitchen perfect for all our catering needs.
Warm and cosy for the cold day we had, but terrace and chairs for the sun!
We used the BBQ which included gas.
Would definitely recommend.
Thanks Mary Jane"
22048463,146738837,2017-04-23,37729701,Erin,"Mary Jane's place was fantastic! Great location, a quick walk to the ocean for some incredible sunset views. 

We had a very comfortable stay, felt like a home away from home! "
22048463,148855269,2017-05-01,113466309,Kay,"Really nice Neighborhood. Communication with MaryJane was a breeze. The home is very clean, the beds comfortable and throws on the couch are so soft. This was my first airbnb, so am hoping that any airbnb I book from now on is as easy to book, and just as clean and comfy. "
22048463,150691361,2017-05-08,3848792,Chuck,Great place that has everything.  Close to many attractions and restaurants.  Very quiet and private.

22048463,152675437,2017-05-17,32603704,George,Clean and extremely comfortable w a big yard.  My family and I will be back!
22048463,153674111,2017-05-21,117723322,Nick,"Stayed there with 5 family members for a birthday.  Great place, with an open living room with a big sofa and tv.  One bedroom and living room are also detached from the main house for additional privacy."
22048463,155691744,2017-05-28,64581484,Melanie,"This was the perfect stay for us.  We were able to relax and it had everything we needed and was very comfortable, clean and nice. The fact that we were able to bring the dogs as well was amazing and our little one.  It was just a great experience overall and Mary Jane was a great host. Thank you!"
22048463,158864747,2017-06-08,128381519,Angela,"My family stayed at the Pacific Jewel for four nights in June. It was in the quaint town of Pacific Grove, which is close to Pebble Beach and Monterey, and about 15 mins to Carmel. You can easily walk to the beach, the down town area and pretty Lover's Point. It was a great location. This house was so much better than a  hotel for our family of 4 to spread out and get comfortable! We  could've easily had more people join us. There were three large king bedrooms  and bathrooms, and what looked to be a queen pull out in a special TV room. One of the bedrooms and the TV room was separated from the main house, which my son loved because he felt as if he was in his own house. I believe two of the king beds could be separated into twins. There was a large family room with a great couch, game table and sitting area. There was a nice sized kitchen, complete with everything you need to cook and feed a good sized group and a separate dining room that could probably seat up to 10 people. There is also a nice laundry room, which came in super handy.  The area outside of the house was nicely landscaped with an outdoor table, seating area, hammock and a grill area. We wished it was warmer so we could've spent more time outside! The indoor fireplace wasn't quite working, but I'm sure it is now and was a nice feature. This house had everything you would need to stay. Wonderful bedding, towels, soaps, shampoos, laundry, kitchen stuff. Everything! You could see and hear the ocean off in the distance. We even had baby deer and their mothers frolicking around in the street outside. All is all, this was probably our favorite stay while travelling all around CA. Mary Jane and Joseph couldn't have been quicker in answering questions, and responding to requests. You won't find nicer hosts. Pacific Jewel was exactly that! Thank you! We hope to be back one day, and with additional family members, to enjoy this cool CA home. "
22048463,160371474,2017-06-13,16155481,Peter,Our stay at the Pacific Jewel was great.  Everything was just as advertised and exceeded out expectations.  Highly recommend.
22048463,163984047,2017-06-25,110791846,Aaron,"This was our first experience with AirBnB.
We did not know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised!  MaryJane called while we were on our way and explained where the keys were and gave us a warm welcome.

The home was incredibly clean and tidy.  It was fully stocked with towels and linen.  It also had 3 bathrooms- 1 for each bedroom.  It was a short walk to Lover's Point.  Each room had high quality large screen HD TV.  A bonus was that there is actually a sitting room with a couch and large screen TV adjacent to the garage.

We saw deer on our (Website hidden by Airbnb) was just an amazing time!

There was no moment where we were uncomfortable.  I will definitely recommend this place to all of my family and friends.  I promise that the pictures do not do this place justice.

Thanks for a great time MaryJane!"
22048463,166092172,2017-07-02,118255444,Ted,Awesome house for family and/or friends.  Many comfortable bedrooms and great shared spaces.
22048463,179560263,2017-08-07,35331498,Linda&Julian,"We loved our 4-night stay! The location was ideal for our needs in a neighborhood where all roads (walks) led to some part of the gorgeous coastline or to lovely restaurants and shops nearby…Perfect for our family gathering (including an 18-month old and a dog).  We found MaryJane to be a warm, gracious and helpful host. The residence was large, quiet, well-appointed and generously equipped including 3 unusually comfortable king beds…a very pleasurable stay and we would definitely return."
22048463,185410740,2017-08-21,30412887,Dirk,"Wonderful house to stay at, with big bedrooms and living area. Also loved the patio area's to sit outside to enjoy drinks with friends.
the driveway even fits, if needed, up to four cars and the house i located in a great area close to Monterey centre
Had a great time here"
22048463,188820073,2017-08-30,52330474,Geoff,"We shared this home with two other couples and the layout was Perfect.  The two bedrooms in the main house are at opposite ends for privacy.  O.K. snoring (: and the third bedroom & bath is separated by a patio from the main house.  The yard Totally exceeded are expectations and parking was easy.  The location is just a few minutes drive from golf, dining and the Ocean.  Hey, it's even Pet Friendly and that's hard to find..."
22048463,192662357,2017-09-10,13421756,Michael,"The place was great. We had a large party and where all very comfortable. The location is walking distance to all sorts of things. One of the best experiences.
The house was very straight forward and had everything you would expect in terms of furnishings."
22048463,197529885,2017-09-25,143805029,Judy,"The home was above our expectations.  This was our first experience with staying at an AirBNB and we were very pleased.  The home is an older home, but, very clean, roomy, beautifully decorated with nice updates throughout the home. Mary Jane was a wonderful host, we will definitely consider staying here again if we are in the area again. The Pacific Grove area was a quaint town and nearby to other beautiful destinations, great location."
22048463,198230914,2017-09-28,113414879,Zhongming,"Great place, my family had a wonderful weekend!"
22048463,198837531,2017-09-30,29740913,Jude,"We loved this house as it was just a short
Walk to the coast and so much on offer close by but still a lovely neighborhood.
The house was lovely clean and we were well provided for. The communication was great too. I would recommend this property and host most  highly."
22048463,204779166,2017-10-19,76151722,Ayla,"We were staying with a group of 4 in the house of MaryJane for a conference at Asilomar. We have had an amazing stay at the house! There was plenty of space, it was very clean and the communication with MaryJane went very smooth. Even though we arrived much later than expected, there was somebody to greet us at the house and explain eveything. The ocean views made the whole thing even better!"
22048463,205822460,2017-10-22,4647210,Thach-Giao,"Mary Jane's house is very spacious, well-kept, and in a great location in the Monterey Bay Area.   

Pacific Grove is a neighborhood thats centrally located between Monterey and Carmel, ideal home base for multiple destinations  on the area for us.  

The pictures don't reflect well how roomy and open the whole house is.  We loved the many windows and outdoor spaces.  The view from on of the bedrooms is really quite spectacular, blending indoor-outdoor living.  

We had great meals inside the home through a well-stocked kitchen and dining area and there were good dining destinations nearby as well.  

MaryJane herself is a very attentive host and thought of everything for our stay down to a pack-n-play and sand toys for our infant daughter.  

We had a great stay and hope to come back again soon!

22048463,211692634,2017-11-13,15837729,Gabriela,"My family of 7 stayed three nights in this beautifully decorated and clean home and were very comfortable. The living room is the best part because we all fit comfortably to enjoy conversation and a movie. The checkers - game table, was a nice added feature. Although I read the description of the house I think I misread or misunderstood about the bedrooms-- so I thought I would explain again- There are 2 bedrooms in the main house, and another large nice bedroom and bathroom outside, just off the patio. Then there is also an ""extra"" small room (not typically part of the cost but is available to rent) which is a converted garage room with a sofa bed and a TV. The home has a very nice outside space to enjoy. We drank our coffee (MaryJane provided good coffee, and a great coffee maker) on the patio and watched a family of deer walk by and graze every morning. You could walk about a mile to the ocean.  By car it's an easy access to the highway to Carmel. We drove to the wharf and aquarium although they are close by. The kitchen is equipped with cooking pans and utensils but if you plan to cook you will need to bring or buy all your condiments (i.e. Salt, sugar, etc) but a couple of grocery stores are very close by. Overall we enjoyed this home very much. It was very comfortable for our family of 7 (all adults)."
22048463,214368723,2017-11-25,75275319,Heidi,"My family and I had a wonderful time.  The house  is spacious and welcoming.  Conviemtly located, we enjoyed our walks to Asilomar as well as proximity to Carmel and Monterey."
22048463,226105512,2018-01-08,43694857,Susie,Great location and very nice home.
22048463,227407888,2018-01-14,5470187,Hunter,"This home is beautiful and in perfect location for Monterey, a very short drive to downtown Pacific Grove, and a 5-10 minute drive to Cannery Row and the Monterey Aquarium. MaryJane was a fantastic host!"
22048463,234442146,2018-02-12,135888750,Rob,Fantastic house! Perfect for three couples! Very close to downtown Pacific Grove and a short eight minute drive to Cannary Row. The house was very clean and beautiful inside and out! The patio area was awesome although we didn't get to use it much (busy). Would highly recommend this as a place to stay. Thanks MaryJane!
22178195,221790021,2017-12-27,30646592,Ruth,"Spacious, lovely, modern, comfortable apartment in a great location, and with wonderful views! We highly recommend these accommodations. There were three of us in the group; two stayed in the bedroom and I used the pull out couch. The pull out couch was so comfortable I had a great nights sleep, and I heard that the bed was also very comfortable. There is so much space in the apartment that there was ample room for all of our luggage and clothing. There is a very large walk in closet (which is really a small room) accessible from the hallway, which we used as a base for all of our things. All of the rooms are very large, and all very well accommodated. There are lovely water views from the dining room and living room, and  a large working fireplace in the living room. There are two balconies, one off of the bedroom and one off of the dining area. We were able to walk to many of the local attractions such as the Monterey Aquarium, and the many shops and restaurants in the area. Many of the restaurants and shops are right on the water, and there was a lot of sea life that could be seen such as sea otters and seals and many types of sea birds. This is a great place to stay; we will definitely be back again!"
22178195,222790230,2017-12-30,4184601,Al,"We spent three nights between Christmas and New Year’s at George’s Pacific Petra Suite, and had a delightful time. We appreciated the guest passes George arranged for the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, not only did it save us money, but it saved us from standing in the long ticket line! We also enjoyed a delicious dinner at Petra Mediterranean Restaurant downstairs from the apartment. The flat is very comfortable and spacious, with lots of windows. The location in Pacific Grove is less than a mile from the Aquarium and Lover’s Point Beach, but we had no problem finding parking near the apartment or getting into restaurants nearby. Each day we looked forward to returning from our explorations of the area to spend time relaxing by the fire in the comfortable living room of Pacific Petra Suite. We hope to return again, soon!"
22178195,223134166,2017-12-31,20923898,Cathy,"We love it! We highly recommend staying in this wonderful cozy apartment! it's newly remodeled, crystal clean, and a five minute walk from the beach! the rooms are big and spacious, very comfortable. there are even additional supplies for you in the bathroom, including mouth wash, makeup remover, and even some diapers. The owner George and his wife are incredibly nice and friendly. With a well known mediterranean restaurant “PETRA”downstairs, they offer a 20% discount if you decide to dine downstairs, but even without the discount i would highly recommend paying a visit. the food is delicious and people know it. Remember to make a reservations to eat there. Additionally, George also provides two monterey bay aquarium tickets for free! all in all, truly one of the best places my family has stayed in, and we 10/10 recommend!"
22178195,223821819,2018-01-01,117699590,Sabrina,"We loved staying at this little spot! It was close to the aquarium, but far enough away from the main tourist area. It was very clean, and there were thoughtful touches, such as water bottles in the fridge, and shampoo, shaving cream, and other travel sized hygiene products available. We loved the balconies and the gas fireplace!"
22178195,225485193,2018-01-06,81769456,Frank,Great place and very modern.  Also in a great location!
22178195,229044855,2018-01-21,75754749,Kristi,An amazing place to stay!  Thank you!!
22178195,230677049,2018-01-28,52361972,Rebecca,"Anyone visiting the Pacific Grove or Monterrey area should stay at this place. The check in process was seamless. The apartment is clean and beautiful with views and walking distance to the ocean, the aquarium, lover's point, and local coffee shops and restaurants. 

The aquarium and downtown Monterrey are a little less than a 20min walk, but you could roll off the balcony and probably make it to the beach. Lover's point is less than 10min away and there is a perfect little coffee shop across the street. 

We had a wonderful weekend at a perfect experience."
22178195,232398751,2018-02-04,79754900,Ashkan,"We had an amazing time staying at George’s place. George was very accommodating and very quick to respond to all my questions. The place was in the perfect location where we could walk to Cannery Row and all the shops. The home itself was very spacious and super clean. We had everything we needed and can’t wait to come back again. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Monterey, definitely check out George’s place."
22178195,234107709,2018-02-11,166257984,Nick,Great location and value! Would stay here again in the future!
22178195,235738897,2018-02-17,11050442,Lisa,"Lovely living space w fireplace, comfy queen bed in bedroom. Fold-out bed for those who can take a springy mattress in the common area which is lovely and light w distant water view. Quiet neighborhood. You must be able to climb stairs but it’s worth it for the clean and spacious digs. George provides everything you need and more unless you’re going to cook a complicated dinner in the kitchen—in which case, bring your extra spatula, chef’s knife, etc. Big tv in common room. Two nice little balconies. Charming."
22178195,236257199,2018-02-18,66841446,Dominico,"Great location, big living area, a very attentive host and great food near by. This place is wonderful!"

22178195,239947897,2018-03-03,62660994,Michael,This place is very nice - great location - great amenities. George is exceedingly kind and went out of his way to ensure we had all of our needs met. We actually liked staying here much more then the 4 star hotel we stayed in Monterey the first night of the trip!
22178195,240381663,2018-03-04,10417116,Tian,"George's place is located just a few blocks from the waterfront. It was a quiet and safe location, but only a stone's throw away from the Monterey Bay aquarium and Cannery Row. It was a beautiful walk back to the house after a fun day at the aquarium.

The unit itself was very clean and comfortable. There were several nice touches, including toiletries, bottled water, plenty of towels and blankets, and a Keurig machine. 

Communication with George was friendly and efficient. We also met his lovely family at their restaurant Petra, located downstairs, and had a delicous meal - a highlight of our trip! I highly recommend it if you like mediterranean / middle eastern food. 

Next time we're in town, we wont hesitate to stay at their place again. Thanks for a great stay George!"
22178195,242384583,2018-03-11,170459356,Becky,"This place is worth every penny! Gorgeous view, wonderful amenities, and just so relaxing. Just a walk down the stairs to Petra Restaurant- one of the best meals we've ever had. The food and the service exceeded our expectations and we will definitely be coming back."
22178195,245290087,2018-03-21,48565112,Jeff,"This is by far mine and Karen's favorite place to stay while in PG.  It is very clean and spacious.  The decor and furnishings are comfortable and beautiful.  The queen sized bed with pillow-top is the most comfortable bed I've slept in.  It was so nice to park the car upon arrival and never have to use it again until departure.  Everything is within walking distance, and what a treat to walk downstairs to enjoy an excellent meal at Petra's.  While the restaurant is directly downstairs, the noise is minimal and stops at 9:00 p.m.  This will be our 'go to' place every time we stay in PG."
22178195,245794233,2018-03-23,58190583,Nicole,"Wonderful experience! Everything as described. You can’t beat the location! We had a lovely time walking to all of the cute little restaurants and shops. George was so kind and accommodating, he helped us with parking when we arrived and showed us to the apartment. Apartment was super clean and comfy, the bed was like a cloud! The ocean views were such a treat."
22178195,247248282,2018-03-27,22026361,Milo,"Spotless. Sunny. Cheerful. Stylish. Location, several great restaurants a few steps away. On the way to 17 mile drive. 5 minutes from Cannery Row. Highly recommend."
22178195,249165300,2018-04-01,178281530,Karla,"I would recommend this stylish, comfortable and clean apartment to anyone spending time in the Pacific Grove and Monterey area."
22178195,251896594,2018-04-08,105730442,M,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. George’s place was quiet, spacious, clean, had convenient parking & had a beautiful ocean view. George was extremely responsive to texts from the moment that we booked our stay. 

George’s restaurant, Petra, is directly  downstairs from the apartment. The food was excellent & the service was great! It is now our new favorite restaurant in the area! 

We absolutely recommend George’s place & Petra restaurant!"
22178195,252251184,2018-04-09,32300265,Esteban,George was super accommodating. Check in was very easy and communication was always reliable and almost immediate. I would definitely stay here again.

22178195,254114932,2018-04-15,31608738,Fred,The best way I can describe our visit is that George treated us as family and made our visit very enjoyable. He gave us ideas on what to see and do.  Following up from up from time to time to make sure we had everything we needed.  The Monterey Aquarium is within walking distance. Don’t miss it!  Our trip this time was only over a weekend. We definitely want to come back and spend more time.  George’s restaurant below has some of the best Mediterranean cuisine we’ve tasted.
22178195,254709177,2018-04-17,25359506,Kelly,"This apartment is huge, clean and comfortable.  Gorgeous views and the location cannot be beat.  The hosts are so generous yet give you complete privacy.  It was such a pleasure staying at this gem!"
22292297,234177070,2018-02-11,90734922,Corey,"Cute little 2 bed 1 bath unit in a nice location close to everything. Walking distance to Lover’s Point, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and dozens of adorable shops and little eateries. Josh was a very accommodating host and quick to respond with any questions. Definitely recommend staying here."
22292297,236583934,2018-02-19,30724356,GraceAnn,I stayed here with my brother and sister -in-law for 2 nights.  Josh is a great host and responded quickly.  He was flexible with check in and check out.  The place was cozy but you cabby beat the price or location.  We will definitely try to stay here if we come back!
22359614,232650741,2018-02-05,364880,Bekki,"We had a great stay at Seven Gables. The entire staff was so warm and helpful, and we thoroughly enjoyed all of the amenities at the inn. This room is on the second floor of a beautiful Victorian house with views overlooking the water."

22666758,235738922,2018-02-17,17940949,Farida,Carolyn’s place is newly remodeled and is a cozy but perfect place to stay when in the Monterey area. She was very attentive to our needs and was in constant touch throughout our stay. She had a lovely welcome tray with goodies as well as some freebies to local attractions. This helped us save a significant amount of money during our trip. We stayed with our two young sons and there was enough room to form two pack N play’s into the master bedroom. I would gladly stay at Carolyn’s again! It’s also conveniently located across the street from Trader Joe’s and Safeway
22666758,237376464,2018-02-22,5426655,Tim,Carolyn was the perfect host. Her place was in perfect condition and at the perfect location. Really great value. She was also really helpful during our stay in more ways than I can count. Absolutely world-class experience. Thank you!

Carolyn was an incredibly gracious host!"
22666758,241118213,2018-03-07,103638123,Sara,Great place for 4 people! Very nice hosts and super clean place!
22666758,243380873,2018-03-15,67075893,Roger,"This property is ideally located for exploring the Monerey area, being a very short drive from the Monterey Aquarium and Cannnery Row, the Pacific Grove shops and restaurants, and 17 mile Drive.
The house was warm and comfortable, with a newly refitted bathroom, comfortable beds, and was very clean and freshly presented.  Off street parking was a bonus, as was use of the brand new commercial laundry equipment.
Carolyn is a very 'hands on' host, who responds immediately to any text message or e-mail from her clients.  The accommodation is ideal for a couple or a family of four.  Highly recommended."
22666758,244451971,2018-03-18,63127925,Denae,"Excellent location if your a golfer, sightseeing, just a 5 minute drive down the street to Canary Row/aquarium and the wharf! My husband and I felt the warm and welcoming feeling as soon as we walked through the door! We will be staying here again!"
22666758,245804592,2018-03-23,135077520,Sue,"This is a great Airbnb. Very near to grocery stores and gas stations. Also very close to the ocean. Carolyn is an excellent hostess. She’s very responsive to your needs, and offers a lot of great information about the area. The place was spotless and very comfortable."
22666758,246963354,2018-03-26,94971538,Eric,Had a great time at Carolyn's place.  She is very organized and detailed which is much appreciated.  I have used several vacation rentals and her's was one of my favorites. The location is great for everything in the area.
22666758,248094206,2018-03-30,116303593,Matthew,"Carolyn’s AirBNB is a great value. Very close to everything to do in Monterey - aquarium, 17 mile drive, fishermans wharf, beaches, etc.  She is knowledgeable about the local scene. Comfortable space and Carolyn is easy to communicate with back and forth. She even let us check in an hour early!"
22666758,250321396,2018-04-04,59480323,Tina,Carolyn was very responsive and easy to get along with.  She had a very thoughtful welcome basket for us!  The place was a perfect fit for our family with three young kids.  Easy drive to Cannery Row and the Aquarium.

22713756,244524061,2018-03-18,90674826,Kyle,Great space for large or small groups. Great patio area with fire pit and heat lamp. The heated bathroom floors were a great touch for the very cold weekend we had on the peninsula. I would def recommend this property for groups or families.
22752958,179527645,2017-08-07,7710597,Julius,What a wonderful airbnb listing!  It was super easy to communicate with MaryJane and the house more than delivered on our expectations!  Pacific Grove is a beautiful and relaxing place to visit and I can't think of many better places to stay while there!
22752958,182882949,2017-08-15,97572127,Brent,I booked this place to take my wife on a little Babymoon and it was perfect. We loved everything about the hearts delight and would happily stay here again in the future.

Everything about this place was perfect including kitchen amenities, living room with smart tv and comfy couch, warm beds, and clean, spacious bathroom."
23291026,244542781,2018-03-18,113688155,Elizabeth,"We had a lovely stay at Terri's cottage in Monterey. She welcomed us when we arrived and showed us the house. She also had fruits awaiting for us in the kitchen, so thoughtful!. The cottage is pretty new and super clean. The location is also extremely convenient if you're looking to explore downtown Monterey, Fisherman's Warf and Cannery Row. On our second day, we walked from Terri's cottage to the aquarium (super close!) and to see the sea lions by the water. Overall, a wonderful, cozy stay. Her home comfortably accommodates 4 guests."
23291026,245788376,2018-03-23,124642520,John,"I was looking to stay near Monterey for a few days with my wife and mother-in-law. We found Terri's place which was less than a mile from the Aquarium, and very close to the shops in Pacific Grove. Terri was super helpful and kind, and we all enjoyed how comfortable and clean her place was. I would most definitely pick her place again the next time; the price was amazing for the value!"
23291026,246559655,2018-03-25,10397694,Meg,Wonderful location!

23291026,248101993,2018-03-30,125374518,Lil,"This is a wonderful jewel in the heart of Monterey. A beautiful, well laid-out and convenient space. Just down the road you can pick up the Recreational trail and walk just about anywhere. The cottage is stylish but comfortable with lots of natural light. The beds are comfortable and it was one of the cleanest AirB’s I’ve stayed in. Terri is a wonderful host, thoughtful and kind. I cannot say enough about what a gem this place is and it will be my go-to for the area."
23291026,249749430,2018-04-02,49633639,Marj,"Terri's place is in a great location.  It was a 6 minute walk to Ocean View Blvd in (yes, we timed it), 12 minutes walk to our favorite beach in Pacific Grove, Lover's Point Beach and 6 minute bike ride to the aquarium one day.  Terri's place had a garage we were able to store our bikes, paddle board and wetsuits.  There was plenty of room my husband, 8 year old daughter and me.  Terri's place is new, clean, modern and simple.  The beds and couch were comfortable.  The snacks, bottled water and coffee were a nice touch and very appreciated.  My daughter was happy to wind down to her favorite netflix show on the smart TV.  Terri is easy to work with and friendly.  She lives on the other side of the duplex, but we didn't even know she was there except on arrival and departure because of the garages between the two units.  We would definitely stay here again!"
23291026,251344608,2018-04-07,3921248,Dave,"Great spot, quiet, yet close enough to walk to all the attractions. Nicely updated furnishings, onsite parking, and comfortable beds--can't ask for more"
